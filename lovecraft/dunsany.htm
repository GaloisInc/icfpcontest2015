				<p>As when the sun above a dusky wold,
				<br>Springs into sight and turns the gloom to gold,
				<br>Lights with his magic beams the dew-deck'd bow'r,
				<br>And wakes to life the gay responsive flow'r;
				<br>So now o'er realms where dark'ning dulness lies,
				<br>In solar state see shining PLUNKETT rise!
				<br>Monarch of Fancy! whose ethereal mind
				<br>Mounts fairy peaks, and leaves the throng behind;
				<br>Whose soul untainted bursts the bounds of space,
				<br>And leads to regions of supernal grace:
				<br>Can any praise thee with too strong a tone,
				<br>Who in this age of folly gleam'd alone?
				<br>Thy quill, DUNSANY, with an art divine
				<br>Recalls the gods to each deserted shrine;
				<br>From mystic air a novel pantheon makes,
				<br>And with new spirits fills the meads and brakes;
				<br>With thee we wander thro' primeval bow'rs,
				<br>For thou hast brought earth's childhood back, and ours!
				<br>How leaps the soul, with sudden bliss increas'd,
				<br>When led by thee to lands beyond the East!
				<br>Sick of this sphere, in crime and conflict old,
				<br>We yearn for wonders distant and untold;
				<br>O'er Homer's page a second time we pore,
				<br>And rack our brains for gleams of infant lore:
				<br>But all in vain&mdash;for valiant tho' we strive
				<br>No common means these pictures can revive.
				<br>Then dawns DUNSANY with celestial light
				<br>And fulgent visions break upon our sight:
				<br>His barque enchanted each sad spirit bears
				<br>To shores of gold, beyond the reach of cares.
				<br>No earthly trammels now our thoughts may chain;
				<br>For childhood's fancy hath come back again!
				<br>What glitt'ring worlds now wait our eager eyes!
				<br>What roads untrodden beckon thro' the skies!
				<br>Wonders on wonders line the gorgeous ways,
				<br>And glorious vistas greet the ravish'd gaze;
				<br>Mountains of clouds, castles of crystal dreams,
				<br>Ethereai cities and Elysian streams;
				<br>Temples of blue, where myriad stars adore
				<br>Forgotten gods of aeons gone before!
				<br>Such are thine arts, DUNSANY, such thy skill,
				<br>That scarce terrestrial seems thy moving quill;
				<br>Can man, and man alone, successful draw
				<br>Such scenes of wonder and domains of awe?
				<br>Our hearts, enraptur'd, fix thy mind's abode
				<br>In high PEGANA: hail thee as a god;
				<br>And sure, can aught more high or godlike be
				<br>Than such a fancy as resides in thee?
				<br>Delighted Pan a friend and peer perceives
				<br>As thy sweet music stirs the sylvan leaves;
				<br>The Nine, transported, bless thy golden lyre:
				<br>Approve thy fancy, and applaud thy fire;
				<br>Whilst Jove himself assumes a brother's tone,
				<br>And vows the pantheon equal to his own.
				<br>DUNSANY, may thy days be glad and long;
				<br>Replete with visions, and atune with song;
				<br>May thy rare notes increasing millions cheer,
				<br>Thy name beloved, and thy mem'ry dear!
				<br>'Tis thou who hast in hours of dulness brought
				<br>New charms of language, and new gems of thought;
				<br>Hast with a poet's grace enrich'd the earth
				<br>With aureate dreams as noble as thy birth.
				<br>Grateful we name thee, bright with fix'd renown,
				<br>The fairest jewel in HIBERNIA'S crown.
