   Ben Hayden was always a stubborn chap, and once he had heard about those
   strange statues in the upper Adirondacks, nothing could keep him from
   going to see them. I had been his closest acquaintance for years, and our
   Damon and Pythias friendship made us inseparable at all times. So when Ben
   finally decided to go - well, I had to trot along too, like a faithful
   collie.

   "Jack," he said, "you know Henry Jackson, who was up in a shack beyond
   Lake Placid for that beastly spot in his lung? Well, he came back the
   other day nearly cured, but had a lot to say about some devilish queer
   conditions up there. He ran into the business all of a sudden and can't be
   sure yet that it's anything more than a case of bizarre sculpture; but
   just the same his uneasy impression sticks.

   "It seems he was out hunting one day, and came across a cave with what
   looked like a dog in front of it. Just as he was expecting the dog to bark
   he looked again, and saw the thing wasn't alive at all. It was a stone dog
   - such a perfect image, down to the smallest whisker, that he couldn't
   decide whether it was a supernaturally clever statue or a petrified
   animal. He was almost afraid to touch it, but when he did he realized it
   was surely made of stone.

   "After a while he nerved himself up to go into the cave - and there he got
   a still bigger jolt. Only a little way in there was another stone figure -
   or what looked like it - but this time it was a man's. It lay on the
   floor, on its side, wore clothes, and had a peculiar smile on its face.
   This time Henry didn't stop to do any touching, but beat it straight to
   the village, Mountain Top, you know. Of course he asked questions - but
   they did not get him very far. He found he was on a ticklish subject, for
   the natives only shook their heads, crossed their fingers, and muttered
   something about a 'Mad Dan' - whoever he was.

   "It was too much for Jackson, so he came home weeks ahead of his planned
   time. He told me all about it because he knows how fond I am of strange
   things - and oddly enough, I was able to fish up a recollection that
   dovetailed pretty neatly with his yarn. Do you remember Arthur Wheeler,
   the sculptor who was such a realist that people began calling him nothing
   but a solid photographer? I think you knew him slightly. Well, as a matter
   of fact, he ended up in that part of the Adirondacks himself. Spent a lot
   of time there, and then dropped out of sight. Never heard from again. Now
   if stone statues that look like men and dogs are turning up around there,
   it looks to me as if they might be his work - no matter what the rustics
   say, or refuse to say, about them. Of course a fellow with Jackson's
   nerves might easily get flighty and disturbed over things like that; but
   I'd have done a lot of examining before running away.

   "In fact, Jack, I'm going up there now to look things over - and you're
   coming along with me. It would mean a lot to find Wheeler - or any of his
   work. Anyhow, the mountain air will brace us both up."

   So less then a week later, after a long train ride and a jolting bus trip
   through breathlessly exquisite scenery, we arrived at Mountain Top in the
   late, golden sunlight of a June evening. The village comprised only a few
   small houses, a hotel, and the general store at which our bus drew up; but
   we knew that the latter would probably prove a focus for such information.
   Surely enough, the usual group of idlers was gathered around the steps;
   and when we represented ourselves as health-seekers in search of lodgings
   they had many recommendations to offer.

   Though we had not planned to do any investigating till the next day, Ben
   could not resist venturing some vague, cautious questions when he noticed
   the senile garrulousness of one of the ill-clad loafers. He felt, from
   Jackson's previous experience, that it would be useless to begin with
   references to the queer statues; but decided to mention Wheeler as one
   whom we had known, and in whose fate we consequently had a right to be
   interested.

   The crowd seemed uneasy when Sam stopped his whittling and started
   talking, but they had slight occasion for alarm. Even this barefoot old
   mountain decadent tightened up when he heard Wheeler's name, and only with
   difficulty could Ben get anything coherent out of him.

   "Wheeler?" he had finally wheezed. "Oh, yeh - that feller as was all the
   time blastin' rocks and cuttin' 'em up into statues. So yew knowed him,
   hey? Wal, they ain't much we kin tell ye, and mebbe that's too much. He
   stayed out to Mad Dan's cabin in the hills - but not so very long. Got so
   he wa'nt wanted around no more...by Dan, that is. Kinder soft-spoken and
   got around Dan's wife till the old devil took notice. Pretty sweet on her,
   I guess. But he took the trail sudden, and nobody's seen hide nor hair of
   him since. Dan must a told him sumthin' pretty plain - bad feller to get
   agin ye, Dan is! Better keep away from thar, boys, for they ain't no good
   in that part of the hills. Dan's ben workin' up a worse and worse mood,
   and ain't seen about no more. Nor his wife, neither. Guess he's penned her
   up so's nobody else kin make eyes at her!"

   As Sam resumed his whittling after a few more observations, Ben and I
   exchanged glances. Here, surely, was a new lead which deserved intensive
   following up. Deciding to lodge at the hotel, we settled ourselves as
   quickly as possible; planning for a plunge into the wild hilly country on
   the next day.

   At sunrise we made our start, each bearing a knapsack laden with
   provisions and such tools as we thought we might need. The day before us
   had an almost stimulating air of invitation - through which only a faint
   undercurrent of the sinister ran. Our rough mountain road quickly became
   steep and winding, so that before long our feet ached considerably.

   After about two miles we left the road - crossing a stone wall on our
   right near a great elm and striking off diagonally toward a steeper slope
   according to the chart and directions which Jackson had prepared for us.
   It was rough and briery travelling, but we knew that the cave could not be
   far off. In the end we came upon the aperture quite suddenly - a black,
   bush-grown crevice where the ground shot abruptly upward, and beside it,
   near a shallow rock pool, a small, still figure stood rigid - as if
   rivalling its own uncanny petrification.

   It was a grey dog - or a dog's statue - and as our simultaneous gasp died
   away we scarcely knew what to think. Jackson had exaggerated nothing, and
   we could not believe that any sculptor's hand had succeeded in producing
   such perfection. Every hair of the animal's magnificent coat seemed
   distinct, and those on the back were bristled up as if some unknown thing
   had taken his unaware. Ben, at last half-kindly touching the delicate
   stony fur, gave vent to an exclamation.

   "Good God, Jack, but this can't be any statue! Look at it - all the little
   details, and the way the hair lies! None of Wheeler's technique here! This
   is a real dog - though heaven only knows how he ever got in this state.
   Just like stone - feel for yourself. Do you suppose there's any strange
   gas that sometimes comes out of the cave and does this to animal life? We
   ought to have looked more into the local legends. And if this is a real
   dog - or was a real dog - then that man inside must be the real thing
   too."

   It was with a good deal of genuine solemnity - almost dread - that we
   finally crawled on hands and knees through the cave-mouth, Ben leading.
   The narrowness looked hardly three feet, after which the grotto expanded
   in every direction to form a damp, twilight chamber floored with rubble
   and detritus. For a time we could make out very little, but as we rose to
   our feet and strained our eyes we began slowly to descry a recumbent
   figure amidst the greater darkness ahead. Ben fumbled with his flashlight,
   but hesitated for a moment before turning it on the prostate figure. We
   had little doubt that the stony thing was what had once been a man, and
   something in the thought unnerved us both.

   When Ben at last sent forth the electric beam we saw that the object lay
   on its side, back toward us. It was clearly of the same material as the
   dog outside, but was dressed in the mouldering and unpetrified remains of
   rough sport clothing. Braced as we were for a shock, we approached quite
   calmly to examine the thing; Ben going around to the other side to glimpse
   the averted face. Neither could possibly have been prepared for what Ben
   saw when he flashed the light on those stony features. His cry was wholly
   excusable, and I could not help echoing it as I leaped to his side and
   shared the sight. Yet it was nothing hideous or intrinsically terrifying.
   It was merely a matter of recognition, for beyond the least shadow of a
   doubt this chilly rock figure with its half-frightened, half-bitter
   expression had at one time been our old acquaintance, Arthur Wheeler.

   Some instinct sent us staggering and crawling out of the cave, and down
   the tangled slope to a point whence we could not see the ominous stone
   dog. We hardly knew what to think, for our brains were churning with
   conjectures and apprehensions. Ben, who had known Wheeler well, was
   especially upset; and seemed to be piecing together some threads I had
   overlooked.

   Again and again as we passed on the green slope he repeated "Poor Arthur,
   poor Arthur!" but not till he muttered the name "Mad Dan" did I recall the
   trouble into which, just before his disappearance. Mad Dan, Ben implied,
   would doubtless be glad to see what had happened. For a moment it flashed
   over both of us that the jealous host might have been responsible for the
   sculptor's presence in this evil cave, but the thought went as quickly as
   it came.

   The thing that puzzled us most was to account for the phenomenon itself.
   What gaseous emanation or mineral vapour could have wrought this change in
   so relatively short a time was utterly beyond us. Normal petrification, we
   know, is a slow chemical replacement process requiring vast ages for
   completion; yet here were two stone images which had been living things -
   or at least Wheeler had - only a few weeks before. Conjecture was useless.
   Clearly, nothing remained but to notify the authorities and let them guess
   what they might; and yet at the back of Ben's head that notion about Mad
   Dan still persisted. Anyhow, we clawed our way back to the road, but Ben
   did not turn toward the village, but looked along upward toward where old
   Sam had said Dan's cabin lay. It was the second house from the village,
   the ancient loafer had wheezed, and lay on the left far back from the road
   in a thick copse of scrub oaks. Before I knew it Ben was dragging me up
   the sandy highway past a dingy farmstead and into a region of increasing
   wildness.

   It did not occur to me to protest, but I felt a certain sense of mounting
   menace as the familiar marks of agriculture and civilization grew fewer
   and fewer. At last the beginning of a narrow, neglected path opened up on
   our left, while the peaked roof of a squalid, unpainted building shewed
   itself beyond a sickly growth of half-dead trees. This, I knew, must be
   Mad Dan's cabin; and I wondered that wheeler had ever chosen so
   unprepossessing a place for his headquarters. I dreaded to walk up that
   weedy, uninviting path, but could not lag behind, when Ben strode
   determinedly along and began a vigorous rapping at the rickety,
   musty-smelling door.

   There was no response to the knock, and something in its echoes sent a
   series of shivers through one. Ben, however, was quite unperturbed; and at
   once began to circle the house in quest of unlocked windows. The third
   that he tried - in the rear of the dismal cabin - proved capable of
   opening, and after a boost and a vigorous spring he was safely inside and
   helping me after him.

   The room in which we landed was full of limestone and granite blocks,
   chiselling tools and clay models, and we realised at once that it was
   Wheeler's erstwhile studio. So far we had not met with any sign of life,
   but over everything hovered a damnably ominous dusty odour. On our left
   was an open door evidently leading to a kitchen on the chimney side of the
   house, and through this Ben started, intent on finding anything he could
   concerning his friend's last habitat. He was considerably ahead of me when
   he crossed the threshold, so that I could not see at first what brought
   him up short and wrung a low cry of horror from his lips.

   In another moment, though, I did see - and repeated his cry as
   instinctively as I had done in the cave. For here in this cabin - far from
   any subterranean depths which could breed strange gases and work strange
   mutations - were two stony figures which I knew at once were no products
   of Arthur Wheeler's chisel. In a rude armchair before the fireplace, bound
   in position by the lash of a long rawhide whip, was the form of a man -
   unkempt, elderly, and with a look of fathomless horror on its evil,
   petrified face.

   On the floor beside it lay a woman's figure; graceful, and with a face
   betokening considerable youth and beauty. Its expression seemed to be one
   of sardonic satisfaction, and near its outflung right hand was a large tin
   pail, somewhat stained on the inside, as with a darkish sediment.

   We made no move to approach those inexplicably petrified bodies, nor did
   we exchange any but the simplest conjectures. That this stony couple hand
   been Mad Dan and his wife we could not well doubt, but how to account for
   their present condition was another matter. As we looked horrifiedly
   around we saw the suddenness with which the final development must have
   come - for everything about us seemed, despite a heavy coating of dust, to
   have been left in the midst of commonplace household activities.

   The only exception to this rule of casualness was on the kitchen table; in
   whose cleared centre, as if to attract attention, lay a thin, battered,
   blank-book weighed down by a sizeable tin funnel. Crossing to read the
   thing, Ben saw that it was a kind of diary or set of dated entries,
   written in a somewhat cramped and none too practiced hand. The very first
   words riveted my attention, and before ten seconds had elapsed he was
   breathlessly devouring the halting text - I avidly following as I peered
   over his shoulder. As we read on - moving as we did so into the less
   loathsome atmosphere of the adjoining room - many obscure things became
   terribly clear to us, and we trembled with a mixture of complex emotions.

   This is what we read - and what the coroner read later on. The public has
   seen a highly twisted and sensationalised version in the cheap newspapers,
   but not even that has more than a fraction of the genuine terror which the
   original held for us as we puzzled it out alone in that musty cabin among
   the wild hills, with two monstrous stone abnormalities lurking in the
   death-like silence of the next room. When we had finished Ben pocketed the
   book with a gesture half of repulsion, and his first words were "Let's get
   out of here."

   Silently and nervously we stumbled to the front of the house, unlocked the
   door, and began the long tramp back to the village. There were many
   statements to make and questions to answer in the days that followed, and
   I do not think that either Ben or I can ever shake off the effects of the
   whole harrowing experience. Neither can some of the local authorities and
   city reporters who flocked around - even though they burned a certain book
   and many papers found in attic boxes, and destroyed considerable apparatus
   in the deepest part of that sinister hillside cave. But here is the text
   itself:

   "Nov. 5 - My name is Daniel Morris. Around here they call me 'Mad Dan'
   because I believe in powers that nobody else believes in nowadays. When I
   go up on Thunder Hill to keep the Feast of the Foxes they think I am crazy
   - all except the back country folks that are afraid of me. They try to
   stop me from sacrificing the Black Goat at Hallow Eve, and always prevent
   my doing the Great Rite that would open the gate. They ought to know
   better, for they know that I am a Van Kauran on my mother's side, and
   anybody this side of the Hudson can tell what the Van Kaurans have handed
   down. We come from Nicholas Van Kauran, the wizard, who was hanged in
   Wijtgaart in 1587, and everybody knows he had made the bargain with the
   Black Man.

   "The soldiers never got his Book of Eibon when they burned his house, and
   his grandson, William Van Kauran, brought it over when he came to
   Rensselaerwyck and later crossed the river to Esopus. Ask anybody in
   Kingston or Hurley about what the William Van Kauran line could do to
   people that got in their way. Also, ask them if my Uncle Hendrik didn't
   manage to keep hold of the Book of Eibon when they ran him out of town and
   he went up the river to this place with his family.

   "I am writing this - and am going to keep writing this - because I want
   people to know the truth after I am gone. Also, I am afraid I shall really
   go mad if I don't set things down in plain black and white. Everything is
   going against me, and if it keeps up I shall have to use the secrets in
   the Book and call in certain Powers. Three months ago that sculptor Arthur
   Wheeler came to Mountain Top, and they sent him up to me because I am the
   only man in the place who knows anything except farming, hunting, and
   fleecing summer boarders. The fellow seemed to be interested in what I had
   to say, and made a deal to stop in here for $13.00 a week with meals. I
   gave him the back room beside the kitchen for his lumps of stone and his
   chiselling, and arranged with Nate Williams to tend to his rock blasting
   and haul his big pieces with a drag and yoke of oxen.

   "That was three months ago. Now I know why that cursed son of hell took so
   quick to the place. It wasn't my talk at all, but the looks of my wife
   Rose, that is Osborne Chandler's oldest girl. She is sixteen years younger
   than I am, and is always casting sheep's eyes at the fellows in town. But
   we always managed to get along fine enough till this dirty rat shewed up,
   even if she did balk at helping me with the Rites on Roodmas and
   Hallowmass. I can see now that Wheeler is working on her feelings and
   getting her so fond of him that she hardly looks at me, and I suppose
   he'll try to elope with her sooner or later.

   "But he works slow like all sly, polished dogs, and I've got plenty of
   time to think up what to do about it. They don't either of them know I
   suspect anything, but before long they'll both realise it doesn't pay to
   break up a Van Kauran's home. I promise them plenty of novelty in what
   I'll do.

   "Nov. 25 - Thanksgiving Day! That's a pretty good joke! But at that I'll
   have something to be thankful for when I finish what I've started. No
   question but that Wheeler is trying to steal my wife. For the time being,
   though, I'll let him keep on being a star boarder. Got the Book of Eibon
   down from Uncle Hendrik's old trunk in the attic last week, and am looking
   up something good which won't require sacrifices that I can't make around
   here. I want something that'll finish these two sneaking traitors, and at
   the same time get me into no trouble. If it has a twist of drama in it, so
   much the better. I've thought of calling in the emanation of Yoth, but
   that needs a child's blood and I must be careful about the neighbours. The
   Green Decay looks promising, but that would be a bit unpleasant for me as
   well as for them. I don't like certain sights and smells.

   "Dec. 10 - Eureka! I've got the very thing at last! Revenge is sweet - and
   this is the perfect climax! Wheeler, the sculptor - this is too good! Yes,
   indeed, that damned sneak is going to produce a statue that will sell
   quicker than any of the things he's been carving these past weeks! A
   realist, eh? Well - the new statuary won't lack any realism! I found the
   formula in a manuscript insert opposite page 679 of the Book. From the
   handwriting I judge it was put there by my great-grandfather Bareut
   Picterse Van Kauran - the one who disappeared from New Paltz in 1839. Ia:!
   Shub-Niggurath! The Goat with a Thousand Young!

   "To be plain, I've found a way to turn those wretched rats into stone
   statues. It's absurdly simple, and really depends more on plain chemistry
   than on the Outer Powers. If I can get hold of the right stuff I can brew
   a drink that'll pass for home-made wine, and one swig ought to finish any
   ordinary being short of an elephant. What it amounts to is a kind of
   petrification infinitely speeded up. Shoots the whole system full of
   calcium and barium salts and replaces living cells with mineral matter so
   fast that nothing can stop it. It must have been one of those things
   great-grandfather got at the Great Sabbat on Sugar-Loaf in the Catskills.
   Queer things used to go on there. Seems to me I heard of a man in New
   Paltz - Squire Hasbruck - turned to stone or something like that in 1834.
   He was an enemy of the Van Kaurans. First thing I must do is order the
   five chemicals I need from Albany and Montreal. Plenty of time later to
   experiment. When everything is over I'll round up all the statues and sell
   them as Wheeler's work to pay for his overdue board bill! He always was a
   realist and an egoist - wouldn't it be natural for him to make a
   self-portrait in stone, and to use my wife for another model - as indeed
   he's really been doing for the past fortnight? Trust the dull public not
   to ask what quarry the queer stone came from!

   "Dec. 25 - Christmas. Peace on earth, and so forth! These two swine are
   goggling at each other as if I didn't exist. They must think I'm deaf,
   dumb, and blind! Well, the barium sulphate and calcium chloride came from
   Albany last Thursday, and the acids, catalytics, and instruments are due
   from Montreal any day now. The mills of the gods - and all that! I'll do
   the work in Allen's Cave near the lower wood lot, and at the same time
   will be openly making some wine in the cellar here. There ought to be some
   excuse for offering a new drink - though it won't take much planning to
   fool those two moonstruck nincompoops. The trouble will be to make Rose
   take wine, for she pretends not to like it. Any experiments that I make on
   animals will be down at the cave, and nobody ever thinks of going there in
   winter. I'll do some wood-cutting to account for my time away. A small
   load or two brought in will keep him off the track.

   "Jan. 20 - It's harder work than I thought. a lot depends on the exact
   proportions. The stuff came from Montreal, but I had to send again for
   some better scales and an acetylene lamp. They're getting curious down at
   the village. Wish the express office weren't in Steenwyck's store. Am
   trying various mixtures on the sparrows that drink and bathe in the pool
   in front of the cave - when it's melted. Sometimes it kills them, but
   sometimes they fly away. Clearly, I've missed some important reaction. I
   suppose Rose and that upstart are making the most of my absence - but I
   can afford to let them. there can be no doubt of my success in the end.

   "Feb. 11 - Have got it at last! Put a fresh lot in the little pond - which
   is well melted today - and the first bird that drank toppled over as if he
   were shot. I picked him up a second later, and he was a perfect piece of
   stone, down to the smallest claws and feather. Not a muscle changed since
   he was poised for drinking, so he must have died the instant any of the
   stuff got to his stomach. I didn't expect the petrification to come so
   soon. But a sparrow isn't a fair test of the way the thing would act with
   a large animal. I must get something bigger to try it on, for it must be
   the right strength when I give it to those swine. I guess Rose's dog Rex
   will do. I'll take him along the next time and say a timber wolf got him.
   she thinks a lot of him, and I shan't be sorry to give her something to
   sniffle over before the big reckoning. I must be careful where I keep this
   book. Rose sometimes pries around in the queerest places.

   "Feb. 15 - Getting warm! Tried it on Rex and it worked like a charm with
   only double the strength. I fixed the rock pool and got him to drink. He
   seemed to know something queer had hit him, for he bristled and growled,
   but he was a piece of stone before he could turn his head. the solution
   ought to have been stronger, and for a human being ought to be very much
   stronger. I think I'm getting the hang of it now, and am about ready for
   that cur Wheeler. The stuff seems to be tasteless, but to make sure I'll
   flavour it with the new wine I'm making up at the house. Wish I were surer
   about the tastelessness, so I could give it to Rose in water without
   trying to urge wine on her. I'll get the two separately - Wheeler out here
   and Rose at home. Have just fixed a strong solution and cleared away all
   strange objects in front of the cave. Rose whimpered like a puppy when I
   told her a wolf had got Rex, and Wheeler gurgled a lot of sympathy.

   "March 1 - Ia: R'lyeh! Praise the Lord Tsathoggua! I've got the son of
   hell at last! Told him I'd found a new ledge of friable limestone down
   this way, and he trotted after me like the yellow cur he is! I had the
   wine-flavoured stuff in a bottle on my hip, and he was glad of a swig when
   we got here. Gulped it down without a wink - and dropped in his tracks
   before you could count three. But he knows I've had my vengeance, for I
   made a face at him that he couldn't miss. I saw the look of understanding
   come into his face as he keeled over. In two minutes he was solid stone.

   "I dragged him into the cave and put Rex's figure outside again. that
   bristling dog shape will help to scare people off. It's getting time for
   the spring hunters, and besides, there's a damned 'lunger' named Jackson
   in a cabin over the hill who does a lot of snooping around in the snow. I
   wouldn't want my laboratory and storeroom to be found just yet! when I got
   home I told Rose that Wheeler had found a telegram at the village
   summoning him suddenly home. I don't know whether she believed me or not
   but I doesn't matter. For form's sake, I packed Wheeler's things and took
   them down the hill, telling her I was going to ship them after him. I put
   them in the dry well at the abandoned Rapelye place. Now for Rose!

   "March 3 - Can't get Rose to drink any wine. I hope that stuff is
   tasteless enough to go unnoticed in water. I tried it in tea and coffee,
   but it forms a precipitate and can't be used that way. If I use it in
   water I'll have to cut down the dose and trust to a more gradual action.
   Mr. and Mrs. Hoog dropped in this noon, and I had hard work keeping the
   conversation away from Wheeler's departure. It mustn't get around that we
   say he was called back to New York when everybody at the village knows
   that no telegram came, and that he didn't leave on the bus. Rose is acting
   damned queer about the whole thing. I'll have to pick a quarrel with her
   and keep her locked in the attic. The best way is to try to make her drink
   that doctored wine - and if she does give in, so much better.

   "March 7 - Have started in on Rose. She wouldn't drink the wine so I took
   a whip to her and drove her up to the attic. She'll never come down alive.
   I pass her a platter of salty bread and salt meat, and a pail of slightly
   doctored water, twice a day. The salt food ought to make her drink a lot,
   and it can't be long before the action sets in. I don't like the way she
   shouts about Wheeler when I'm at the door. The rest of the time she is
   absolutely silent.

   "March 9 - It's damned peculiar how slow that stuff is in getting hold of
   Rose. I'll have to make it stronger - probably she'll never taste it with
   all the salt I've been feeding her. well, if it doesn't get there are
   plenty of other ways to fall back on. but I would like to carry this neat
   statue plan through! Went to the cave this morning and all is well there.
   I sometimes hear Rose's footsteps on the ceiling overhead, and I think
   they're getting more and more dragging. The stuff is certainly working,
   but it's too slow. Not strong enough. From now on I'll rapidly stiffen up
   the dose.

   "March 11 - It is very queer. She is still alive and moving. Tuesday night
   I heard her piggling with a window, so went up and gave her a rawhiding.
   She acts more sullen than frightened, and her eyes look swollen. But she
   could never drop to the ground from that height and there's nowhere she
   could climb down. I have had dreams at night, for her slow, dragging
   pacing on the floor above gets on my nerves. Sometimes I think she works
   at the lock on the door.

   "March 15 - Still alive, despite all the strengthening of the dose.
   There's something queer about it. she crawls now, and doesn't pace very
   often. But the sound of her crawling is horrible. She rattles the windows,
   too, and fumbles with the door. I shall have to finish her off with the
   rawhide if this keeps up. I'm getting very sleepy. Wonder if Rose has got
   on her guard somehow. But she must be drinking the stuff. This sleepiness
   is abnormal - I think the strain is telling on me. I'm sleepy..."

   to a note in a firmer, evidently feminine handwriting, indicative of great
   emotional tension.)

   "March 16 - 4 a.m. - This is added by Rose C. Morris, about to die. Please
   notify my father, Osborne E. Chandler, Route 2, Mountain Top, N.Y. I have
   just read what the beast has written. I felt sure he had killed Arthur
   Wheeler, but did not know till I read this terrible notebook. Now I know
   what I escaped. I noticed the water tasted queer, so took none of it after
   the first sip. I threw it all out of the window. That one sip has half
   paralysed me, but I can still get about. The thirst was terrible, but I
   ate as little as possible of the salty food and was able to get a little
   water up here under places where the roof leaked.

   "There were two great rains. I thought he was trying to poison me, though
   I didn't know what the poison was like. What he has written about himself
   and me is a lie. We were never happy together and I think I married him
   only under one of those spells that he was able to lay on people. I guess
   he hypnotised both my father and me, for he was always hated and feared
   and suspected of dark dealings with the devil. My father once called him
   The Devil's Kin, and he was right.

   "No one will ever know what I went through as his wife. It was not simply
   common cruelty - though God knows he was cruel enough, and beat me often
   with a leather whip. It was more - more than anyone in this age can ever
   understand. He was a monstrous creature, and practiced all sorts of
   hellish ceremonies handed down by his mother's people. He tried to make me
   help in the rites - and I don't dare even hint what they were. I would
   not, so he beat me. It would be blasphemy to tell what he tried to make me
   do. I can say he was a murderer even then, for I know what he sacrificed
   one night on Thunder Hill. He was surely the Devil's Kin. I tried four
   times to run away, but he always caught and beat me. Also, he had a sort
   of hold over my mind, and even over my father's mind.

   "About Arthur Wheeler I have nothing to be ashamed of. We did come to love
   each other, but only in an honorable way. He gave me the first kind
   treatment I had ever had since leaving my father's, and meant to help me
   get out of the clutches of that fiend. He had several talks with my
   father, and was going to help me get out west. After my divorce we would
   have been married.

   "Ever since that brute locked me in the attic I have planned to get out
   and finish him. I always kept the poison overnight in case I could escape
   and find him asleep and give it to him somehow. At first he waked easily
   when I worked on the lock of the door and tested the conditions at the
   windows, but later he began to get more tired and sleep sounder. I could
   always tell by his snoring when he asleep.

   "Tonight he was so fast asleep I forced the lock without waking him. it
   was hard work getting downstairs with my partial paralysis, but I did. I
   found him here with the lamp burning - asleep at the table, where he had
   been writing in this book. In the corner was the long rawhide whip he had
   so often beaten me with. I used it to tie him to the chair so he could not
   move a muscle. I lashed his neck so that I could pour anything down his
   throat without his resisting.

   "He waked up just as I was finishing and I guess he saw right off that he
   was done for. he shouted frightful things and tried to chant mystical
   formulas, but I choked him off a dish towel from the sink. Then I saw this
   book he had been writing in, and stopped to read it. the shock was
   terrible, and I almost fainted four or five time. My mind was not ready
   for such things. After that I talked to that fiend for two or three hours
   steady. I told everything I had wanted to tell him through all the years I
   had been his slave, and lot of other things that had to with what I read
   in this awful book.

   "He looked almost purple when I was through, and I think he was half
   delirious. Then I got a funnel from the cupboard and jammed it into his
   mouth after taking out the gag. He knew what I was going to do, but was
   helpless. I had brought down the pail of poisoned water, and without a
   qualm, I poured a good half of it into the funnel.

   "It must have been a very strong dose, for almost at once I saw that brute
   begin to stiffen and turn a dull stony grey. In ten minutes I knew he was
   solid stone. I could bear to touch him, but the tin funnel clinked
   horribly when I pulled it out of his mouth. I wish I could have given that
   Kin of the Devil a more painful, lingering death, but surely this was the
   most appropriate he could have had.

   "There is not much more to say. I am half-paralysed, and with Arthur
   murdered I have nothing to live for. I shall make things complete by
   drinking the rest of the poison after placing this book where it will be
   found. In a quarter of an hour I shall be a stone statue. My only wish is
   to be buried beside the statue that was Arthur - when it is found in that
   cave where the fiend left it. Poor trusting Rex ought to lie at our feet.
   I do not care what becomes of the stone devil tied in the chair...."
