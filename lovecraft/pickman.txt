   You needn't think I'm crazy, Eliot - plenty of others have queerer
   prejudices than this. Why don't you laugh at Oliver's grandfather, who
   won't ride in a motor? If I don't like that damned subway, it's my own
   business; and we got here more quickly anyhow in the taxi. We'd have had
   to walk up the hill from Park Street if we'd taken the car.

   I know I'm more nervous than I was when you saw me last year, but you
   don't need to hold a clinic over it. There's plenty of reason, God knows,
   and I fancy I'm lucky to be sane at all. Why the third degree? You didn't
   use to be so inquisitive.

   Well, if you must hear it, I don't know why you shouldn't. Maybe you ought
   to, anyhow, for you kept writing me like a grieved parent when you heard
   I'd begun to cut the Art Club and keep away from Pickman. Now that he's
   disappeared I go round to the club once in a while, but my nerves aren't
   what they were.

   No, I don't know what's become of Pickman, and I don't like to guess. You
   might have surmised I had some inside information when I dropped him - and
   that's why I don't want to think where he's gone. Let the police find what
   they can - it won't be much, judging from the fact that they don't know
   yet of the old North End place he hired under the name of Peters.

   I'm not sure that I could find it again myself - not that I'd ever try,
   even in broad daylight!

   Yes, I do know, or am afraid I know, why he maintained it. I'm coming to
   that. And I think you'll understand before I'm through why I don't tell
   the police. They would ask me to guide them, but I couldn't go back there
   even if I knew the way. There was something there - and now I can't use
   the subway or (and you may as well have your laugh at this, too) go down
   into cellars any more.

   I should think you'd have known I didn't drop Pickman for the same silly
   reasons that fussy old women like Dr. Reid or Joe Minot or Rosworth did.
   Morbid art doesn't shock me, and when a man has the genius Pickman had I
   feel it an honour to know him, no matter what direction his work takes.
   Boston never had a greater painter than Richard Upton Pickman. I said it
   at first and I say it still, and I never swenved an inch, either, when he
   showed that 'Ghoul Feeding'. That, you remember, was when Minot cut him.

   You know, it takes profound art and profound insight into Nature to turn
   out stuff like Pickman's. Any magazine-cover hack can splash paint around
   wildly and call it a nightmare or a Witches' Sabbath or a portrait of the
   devil, but only a great painter can make such a thing really scare or ring
   true. That's because only a real artist knows the actual anatomy of the
   terrible or the physiology of fear - the exact sort of lines and
   proportions that connect up with latent instincts or hereditary memories
   of fright, and the proper colour contrasts and lighting effects to stir
   the dormant sense of strangeness. I don't have to tell you why a Fuseli
   really brings a shiver while a cheap ghost-story frontispiece merely makes
   us laugh. There's something those fellows catch - beyond life - that
   they're able to make us catch for a second. Dore had it. Sime has it.
   Angarola of Chicago has it. And Pickman had it as no man ever had it
   before or - I hope to Heaven - ever will again.

   Don't ask me what it is they see. You know, in ordinary art, there's all
   the difference in the world between the vital, breathing things drawn from
   Nature or models and the artificial truck that commercial small fry reel
   off in a bare studio by rule. Well, I should say that the really weird
   artist has a kind of vision which makes models, or summons up what amounts
   to actual scenes from the spectral world he lives in. Anyhow, he manages
   to turn out results that differ from the pretender's mince-pie dreams in
   just about the same way that the life painter's results differ from the
   concoctions of a correspondence-school cartoonist. If I had ever seen what
   Pickman saw - but no! Here, let's have a drink before we get any deeper.
   Gad, I wouldn't be alive if I'd ever seen what that man - if he was a man
   - saw !

   You recall that Pickman's forte was faces. I don't believe anybody since
   Goya could put so much of sheer hell into a set of features or a twist of
   expression. And before Goya you have to go back to the mediaeval chaps who
   did the gargoyles and chimaeras on Notre Dame and Mont Saint-Michel. They
   believed all sorts of things - and maybe they saw all sorts of things,
   too, for the Middle Ages had some curious phases I remember your asking
   Pickman yourself once, the year before you went away, wherever in thunder
   he got such ideas and visions. Wasn't that a nasty laugh he gave you? It
   was partly because of that laugh that Reid dropped him. Reid, you know,
   had just taken up comparative pathology, and was full of pompous 'inside
   stuff' about the biological or evolutionary significance of this or that
   mental or physical symptom. He said Pickman repelled him more and more
   every day, and almost frightened him towards the last - that the fellow's
   features and expression were slowly developing in a way he didn't like; in
   a way that wasn't human. He had a lot of talk about diet, and mid Pickman
   must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree. I suppose you told
   Reid, if you and he had any correspondence over it, that he'd let
   Pickman's paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his imagination. I know
   I told him that myself - then.

   But keep in mind that I didn't drop Pickman for anything like this. On the
   contrary, my admiration for him kept growing; for that 'Ghoul Feeding' was
   a tremendous achievement. As you know, the club wouldn't exhibit it, and
   the Museum of Fine Arts wouldn't accept it as a gift; and I can add that
   nobody would buy it, so Pickman had it right in his house till he went.
   Now his father has it in Salem - you know Pickman comes of old Salem
   stock, and had a witch ancestor hanged in 1692.

   I got into the habit of calling on Pickman quite often, especially after I
   began making notes for a monograph on weird art. Probably it was his work
   which put the idea into my head, and anyhow, I found him a mine of data
   and suggestions when I came to develop it. He showed me all the paintings
   and drawings he had about; including some pen-and-ink sketches that would,
   I verily believe, have got him kicked out of the club if many of the
   members had seen them. Before long I was pretty nearly a devotee, and
   would listen for hours like a schoolboy to art theories and philosophic
   speculations wild enough to qualify him for the Danvers asylum. My
   hero-worship, coupled with the fact that people generally were commencing
   to have less and less to do with him, made him get very confidential with
   me; and one evening he hinted that if I were fairly close-mouthed and none
   too squeamish, he might show me something rather unusual - something a bit
   stronger than anything he had in the house.

   'You know,' he said, 'there are things that won't do for Newbury Street -
   things that are out of place here, and that can't be conceived here,
   anyhow. It's my business to catch the overtones of the soul, and you won't
   find those in a parvenu set of artificial streets on made land. Back Bay
   isn't Boston - it isn't anything yet, because it's had no time to pick up
   memories and attract local spirits. If there are any ghosts here, they're
   the tame ghosts of a salt marsh and a shallow cove; and I want human
   ghosts - the ghosts of beings highly organized enough to have looked on
   hell and known the meaning of what they saw.

   'The place for an artist to live is the North End. If any aesthete were
   sincere, he'd put up with the slums for the sake of the massed traditions.
   God, man! Don't you realize that places like that weren't merely made, but
   actually grew? Generation after generation lived and felt and died there,
   and in days when people weren't afraid to live and fed and die. Don't you
   know there was a mill on Copp's Hill in 1632, and that half the present
   streets were laid out by 1650? I can show you houses that have stood two
   centuries and a half and more; houses that have witnessed what would make
   a modern house crumble into powder. What do moderns know of life and the
   forces behind it? You call the Salem witchcraft a delusion, but I'll wager
   my four-times-great-grandmother could have told you things. They hanged
   her on Gallows Hill, with Cotton Mather looking sanctimoniously on.
   Mather, damn him, was afraid somebody might succeed in kicking free of
   this accursed cage of monotony - I wish someone had laid a spell on him or
   sucked his blood in the night!

   'I can show you a house he lived in, and I can show you another one he was
   afraid to enter in spite of all his fine bold talk. He knew things he
   didn't dare put into that stupid Magnalia or that puerile Wonders of the
   Invisible World. Look here, do you know the whole North End once had a set
   of tunnels that kept certain people in touch with each other's houses, and
   the burying ground, and the sea? Let them prosecute and persecute above
   ground - things went on every day that they couldn't reach, and voices
   laughed at night that they couldn't place!

   'Why, man, out of ten surviving houses built before 1700 and not moved
   since I'll wager that in eight I can show you something queer in the
   cellar. There's hardly a month that you don't read of workmen finding
   bricked-up arches and wells leading nowhere in this or that old place as
   it comes down - you could see one near Henchman Street from the elevated
   last year. There were witches and what their spells summoned; pirates and
   what they brought in from the sea; smugglers; privateers - and I tell you,
   people knew how to live, and how to enlarge the bounds of life, in the old
   time! This wasn't the only world a bold and wise man could know - faugh!
   And to think of today in contrast, with such pale-pink brains that even a
   club of supposed artists gets shudders and convulsions if a picture goes
   beyond the feelings of a Beacon Street tea-table!

   'The only saving grace of the present is that it's too damned stupid to
   question the past very closely. What do maps and records and guide-books
   really tell of the North End? Bah! At a guess I'll guarantee to lead you
   to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys north of Prince Street
   that aren't suspected by ten living beings outside of the foreigners that
   swarm them. And what do those Dagoes know of their meaning? No, Thurber,
   these ancient places are dreaming gorgeously and over-flowing with wonder
   and terror and escapes from the commonplace, and yet there's not a living
   soul to understand or profit by them. Or rather, there's only one living
   soul - for I haven't been digging around in the past for nothing !

   'See here, you're interested in this sort of thing. What if I told you
   that I've got another studio up there, where I can catch the night-spirit
   of antique horror and paint things that I couldn't even think of in
   Newbury Street? Naturally I don't tell those cursed old maids at the club
   - with Reid, damn him, whispering even as it is that I'm a sort of monster
   bound down the toboggan of reverse evolution. Yes, Thurber, I decided long
   ago that one must paint terror as well as beauty from life, so I did some
   exploring in places where I had reason to know terror lives.

   'I've got a place that I don't believe three living Nordic men besides
   myself have ever seen. It isn't so very far from the elevated as distance
   goes, but it's centuries away as the soul goes. I took it because of the
   queer old brick well in the cellar - one of the sort I told you about. The
   shack's almost tumbling down so that nobody else would live there, and I'd
   hate to tell you how little I pay for it. The windows are boarded up, but
   I like that all the better, since I don't want daylight for what I do. I
   paint in the cellar, where the inspiration is thickest, but I've other
   rooms furnished on the ground floor. A Sicilian owns it, and I've hired it
   under the name of Peters.

   'Now, if you're game, I'll take you there tonight. I think you'd enjoy the
   pictures, for, as I said, I've let myself go a bit there. It's no vast
   tour - I sometimes do it on foot, for I don't want to attract attention
   with a taxi in such a place. We can take the shuttle at the South Station
   for Battery Street, and after that the wall isn't much.'

   Well, Eliot, there wasn't much for me to do after that harangue but to
   keep myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant cab we
   could sight. We changed to the elevated at the South Station, and at about
   twelve o'clock had climbed down the steps at Battery Street and struck
   along the old waterfront past Constitution Wharf. I didn't keep track of
   the cross streets, and can't tell you yet which it was we turned up, but I
   know it wasn't Greenough Lane.

   When we did turn, it was to climb through the deserted length of the
   oldest and dirtiest alley I ever saw in my life, with crumbling-looking
   gables, broken small-paned windows, and archaic chimneys that stood out
   half-disintegrated against the moonlit sky. I don't believe there were
   three houses in sight that hadn't been standing in Cotton Mather's time -
   certainly I glimpsed at least two with an overhang, and once I thought I
   saw a peaked roof-line of the almost forgotten pre-gambrel type, though
   antiquarians tell us there are none left in Boston.

   From that alley, which had a dim light, we turned to the left into an
   equally silent and still narrower alley with no light at all: and in a
   minute made what I think was an obtuse-angled bend towards the right in
   the dark. Not long after this Pickman produced a flashlight and revealed
   an antediluvian ten-panelled door that looked damnably worm-eaten.
   Unlocking it, he ushered me into a barren hallway with what was once
   splendid dark-oak panelling - simple, of course, but thrillingly
   suggestive of the times of Andros and Phipps and the Witchcraft. Then he
   took me through a door on the left, lighted an oil lamp, and told me to
   make myself at home.

   Now, Eliot, I'm what the man in the street would call fairly
   'hard-boiled,' but I'll confess that what I saw on the walls of that room
   gave me a bad turn. They were his pictures, you know - the ones he
   couldn't paint or even show in Newbury Street - and he was right when he
   said he had 'let himself go.' Here - have another drink - I need one
   anyhow!

   There's no use in my trying to tell you what they were like, because the
   awful, the blasphemous horror, and the unbelievable loathsomeness and
   moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond the power of words to
   classify. There was none of the exotic technique you see in Sidney Sime,
   none of the trans-Saturnian landscapes and lunar fungi that Clark Ashton
   Smith uses to freeze the blood. The backgrounds were mostly old
   churchyards, deep woods, cliffs by the sea, brick tunnels, ancient
   panelled rooms, or simple vaults of masonry. Copp's Hill Burying Ground,
   which could not be many blocks away from this very house, was a favourite
   scene.

   The madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the foreground - for
   Pickman's morbid art was pre-eminently one of daemoniac portraiture. These
   figures were seldom completely human, but often approached humanity in
   varying degree. Most of the bodies, while roughly bipedal, had a forward
   slumping, and a vaguely canine cast. The texture of the majority was a
   kind of unpleasant rubberiness. Ugh! I can see them now! Their occupations
   - well, don't ask me to be too precise. They were usually feeding - I
   won't say on what. They were sometimes shown in groups in cemeteries or
   underground passages, and often appeared to be in battle over their prey -
   or rather, their treasure-trove. And what damnable expressiveness Pickman
   sometimes gave the sightless faces of this charnel booty! Occasionally the
   things were shown leaping through open windows at night, or squatting on
   the chests of sleepers, worrying at their throats. One canvas showed a
   ring of them baying about a hanged witch on Gallows Hill, whose dead face
   held a close kinship to theirs.

   But don't get the idea that it was all this hideous business of theme and
   setting which struck me faint. I'm not a three-year-old kid, and I'd seen
   much like this before. It was the faces, Eliot, those accursed faces, that
   leered and slavered out of the canvas with the very breath of life! By
   God, man, I verily believe they were alive! That nauseous wizard had waked
   the fires of hell in pigment, and his brush had been a nightmare-spawning
   wand. Give me that decanter, Eliot!

   There was one thing called 'The Lesson' - Heaven pity me, that I ever saw
   it! Listen - can you fancy a squatting circle of nameless dog-like things
   in a churchyard teaching a small child how to feed like themselves? The
   price of a changeling, I suppose - you know the old myth about how the
   weird people leave their spawn in cradles in exchange for the human babes
   they steal. Pickman was showing what happens to those stolen babes - how
   they grow up - and then I began to see a hideous relationship in the faces
   of the human and non-human figures. He was, in all his gradations of
   morbidity between the frankly non-human and the degradedly human,
   establishing a sardonic linkage and evolution. The dog-things were
   developed from mortals!

   And no sooner had I wondered what he made of their own young as left with
   mankind in the form of changelings, than my eye caught a picture embodying
   that very thought. It was that of an ancient Puritan interior - a heavily
   beamed room with lattice windows, a settle, and clumsy seventeenth-century
   furniture, with the family sitting about while the father read from the
   Scriptures. Every face but one showed nobility and reverence, but that one
   reflected the mockery of the pit. It was that of a young man in years, and
   no doubt belonged to a supposed son of that pious father, but in essence
   it was the kin of the unclean things. It was their changeling - and in a
   spirit of supreme irony Pickman had given the features a very perceptible
   resemblance to his own.

   By this time Pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was
   politely holding open the door for me; asking me if I would care to see
   his 'modern studies.' I hadn't been able to give him much of my opinions -
   I was too speechless with fright and loathing - but I think he fully
   understood and felt highly complimented. And now I want to assure you
   again, Eliot, that I'm no mollycoddle to scream at anything which shows a
   bit of departure from the usual. I'm middle-aged and decently
   sophisticated, and I guess you saw enough of me in France to know I'm not
   easily knocked out. Remember, too, that I'd just about recovered my wind
   and gotten used to those frightful pictures which turned colonial New
   England into a kind of annexe of hell. Well, in spite of all this, that
   next room forced a real scream out of me, and I had to clutch at the
   doorway to keep from keeling over. The other chamber had shown a pack of
   ghouls and witches over-running the world of our forefathers, but this one
   brought the horror right into our own daily life!

   Gad, how that man could paint! There was a study called 'Subway Accident,'
   in which a flock of the vile things were clambering up from some unknown
   catacomb through a crack in the floor of the Boylston Street subway and
   attacking a crowd of people on the platform. Another showed a dance on
   Copp's Hill among the tombs with the background of today. Then there were
   any number of cellar views, with monsters creeping in through holes and
   rifts in the masonry and grinning as they squatted behind barrels or
   furnaces and waited for their first victim to descend the stairs.

   One disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast cross-section of Beacon
   Hill, with ant-like armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing themselves
   through burrows that honeycombed the ground. Dances in the modern
   cemeteries were freely pictured, and another conception somehow shocked me
   more than all the rest - a sense in an unknown vault, where scores of the
   beasts crowded about one who hod a well-known Boston guidebook and was
   evidently reading aloud. All were pointing to a certain passage, and every
   face seemed so distorted with epileptic and reverberant laughter that I
   almost thought I heard the fiendish echoes. The title of the picture was,
   'Holmes, Lowell and Longfellow Lie Buried in Mount Auburn.'

   As I gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second room of
   deviltry and morbidity, I began to analyse some of the points in my
   sickening loathing. In the first place, I said to myself, these things
   repelled because of the utter inhumanity and callous crudity they showed
   in Pickman. The fellow must be a relentless enemy of all mankind to take
   such glee in the torture of brain and flesh and the degradation of the
   mortal tenement. In the second place, they terrified because of their very
   greatness. Their art was the art that convinced - when we saw the pictures
   we saw the daemons themselves and were afraid of them. And the queer part
   was, that Pickman got none of his power from the use of selectiveness or
   bizarrerie. Nothing was blurred, distorted, or conventionalized; outlines
   were sharp and lifelike, and details were almost painfully defined. And
   the faces!

   It was not any mere artist's interpretation that we saw; it was
   pandemonium itself, crystal clear in stark objectivity. That was it, by
   Heaven! The man was not a fantaisiste or romanticist at all - he did not
   even try to give us the churning, prismatic ephemera of dreams, but coldly
   and sardonically reflected some stable, mechanistic, and well--established
   horror - world which he saw fully, brilliantly, squarely, and
   unfalteringly. God knows what that world can have been, or where he ever
   glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted and crawled through
   it; but whatever the baffling source of his images, one thing was plain.
   Pickman was in every sense - in conception and in execution - a thorough,
   painstaking, and almost scientific realist.

   My host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual studio, and
   I braced myself for some hellish efforts among the unfinished canvases. As
   we reached the bottom of the damp stairs he fumed his flash-light to a
   comer of the large open space at hand, revealing the circular brick curb
   of what was evidently a great well in the earthen floor. We walked nearer,
   and I saw that it must be five feet across, with walls a good foot thick
   and some six inches above the ground level - solid work of the seventeenth
   century, or I was much mistaken. That, Pickman said, was the kind of thing
   he had been talking about - an aperture of the network of tunnels that
   used to undermine the hill. I noticed idly that it did not seem to be
   bricked up, and that a heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover.
   Thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if
   Pickman's wild hints had not been mere rhetoric, I shivered slightly; then
   turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of
   fair size, provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio. An
   acetylene gas outfit gave the light necessary for work.

   The unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as
   ghastly as the finished ones upstairs, and showed the painstaking methods
   of the artist. Scenes were blocked out with extreme care, and pencilled
   guide lines told of the minute exactitude which Pickman used in getting
   the right perspective and proportions. The man was great - I say it even
   now, knowing as much as I do. A large camera on a table excited my notice,
   and Pickman told me that he used it in taking scenes for backgrounds, so
   that he might paint them from photographs in the studio instead of carting
   his oufit around the town for this or that view. He thought a photograph
   quite as good as an actual scene or model for sustained work, and declared
   he employed them regularly.

   There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and
   half-finished monstrosities that leered round from every side of the room,
   and when Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the
   light I could not for my life keep back a loud scream - the second I had
   emitted that night. It echoed and echoed through the dim vaultings of that
   ancient and nitrous cellar, and I had to choke back a flood of reaction
   that threatened to burst out as hysterical laughter. Merciful Creator!
   Eliot, but I don't know how much was real and how much was feverish fancy.
   It doesn't seem to me that earth can hold a dream like that!

   It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it
   held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a
   child nibbles at a stick of candy. Its position was a kind of crouch, and
   as one looked one felt that at any moment it might drop its present prey
   and seek a juicier morsel. But damn it all, it wasn't even the fiendish
   subject that made it such an immortal fountain - head of all panic - not
   that, nor the dog face with its pointed ears, bloodshot eyes, flat nose,
   and drooling lips. It wasn't the scaly claws nor the mould-caked body nor
   the half-hooved feet - none of these, though any one of them might well
   have driven an excitable man to madness.

   It was the technique, Eliot - the cursed, the impious, the unnatural
   technique! As I am a living being, I never elsewhere saw the actual breath
   of life so fused into a canvas. The monster was there - it glared and
   gnawed and gnawed and glared - and I knew that only a suspen-sion of
   Nature's laws could ever let a man paint a thing like that without a model
   - without some glimpse of the nether world which no mortal unsold to the
   Fiend has ever had.

   Pinned with a thumb-tack to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of
   paper now badly curled up - probably, I thought, a photograph from which
   Pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the night-mare it was to
   enhance. I reached out to uncurl and look at it, when suddenly I saw
   Pickman start as if shot. He had been listening with peculiar intensity
   ever since my shocked scream had waked unaccus-tomed echoes in the dark
   cellar, and now he seemed struck with a fright which, though not
   comparable to my own, had in it more of the physical than of the
   spiritual. He drew a revolver and motioned me to silence, then stepped out
   into the main cellar and closed the door behind him.

   I think I was paralysed for an instant. Imitating Pickman's listening, I
   fancied I heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere, and a series of squeals
   or beats in a direction I couldn't determine. I thought of huge rats and
   shuddered. Then there came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me
   all in gooseflesh - a furtive, groping kind of clatter, though I can't
   attempt to convey what I mean in words. It was like heavy wood falling on
   stone or brick - wood on brick - what did that make me think of?

   It came again, and louder. There was a vibration as if the wood had fallen
   farther than it had fallen before. After that followed a sharp grating
   noise, a shouted gibberish from Pickman, and the deafening dis-charge of
   all six chambers of a revolver, fired spectacularly as a lion--tamer might
   fire in the air for effect. A muffled squeal or squawk, and a thud. Then
   more wood and brick grating, a pause, and the opening of the door - at
   which I'll confess I started violently. Pickman reappeared with his
   smoking weapon, cursing the bloated rats that infested the ancient well.

   'The deuce knows what they eat, Thurber,' he grinned, 'for those archaic
   tunnels touched graveyard and witch-den and sea-coast. But whatever it is,
   they must have run short, for they were devilish anxious to get out. Your
   yelling stirred them up, I fancy. Better be cautious in these old places-
   our rodent friends are the one drawback, though I sometimes think they're
   a positive asset by way of atmosphere and colour.'

   Well, Eliot, that was the end of the night's adventure. Pickman had
   promised to show me the place, and Heaven knows he had done it. He led me
   out of that tangle of alleys in another direction, it seems, for when we
   sighted a lamp-post we were in a half-familiar street with monotonous rows
   of mingled tenement blocks and old houses. Charter Street, it turned out
   to be, but I was too flustered to notice just where we hit it. We were too
   late for the elevated, and walked back downtown through Hanover Street. I
   remember that wall:. We switched from Tremont up Beacon, and Pickman left
   me at the corner of Joy, where I turned off. I never spoke to him again.

   Why did I drop hirn? Don't be impatient. Wait till I ring for coffee.
   We've had enough of the other stuff, but I for one need something. No -it
   wasn't the paintings I saw in that place; though I'll swear they were
   enough to get him ostracised in nine-tenths of the homes and clubs of
   Boston, and I guess you won't wonder now why I have to steer clear of
   subways and cellars. It was - something I found in my coat the next
   morning. You know, the curled-up paper tacked to the frightful canvas in
   the cellar; the thing I thought was a photograph of some scene he meant to
   use as a background for that monster. That last scare had come while I was
   reaching to uncurl it, and it seems I had vacantly crumpled it into my
   pocket. But here's the coffee - take it black, Eliot, if you're wise.

   Yes, that paper was the reason I dropped Pickman; Richard Upton Pickman,
   the greatest artist I have ever known - and the foulest being that ever
   leaped the bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness. Eliot - old
   Reid was right. He wasn't strictly human. Either he was born in strange
   shadow, or he'd found a way to unlock the forbidden gate. It's all the
   same now, for he's gone - back into the fabulous darkness he loved to
   haunt. Here, let's have the chandelier going.

   Don't ask me to explain or even conjecture about what I burned. Don't ask
   me, either, what lay behind that mole-like scrambling Pickman was so keen
   to pass off as rats. There are secrets, you know, which might have come
   down from old Salem times, and Cotton Mather tells even stranger things.
   You know how damned lifelike Pickman's paintings were - how we all
   wondered where he got those faces.

   Well - that paper wasn't a photograph of any background, after all. What
   it showed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful
   canvas. It was the model he was using - and its background was merely the
   wall of the cellar studio in minute detail. But by God, Eliot, it was a
   photograph from life!
