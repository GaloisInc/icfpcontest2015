Old Bugs

        An Extemporaneous Sob Story by Marcus Lollius, Proconsul of Gaul

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                                  Written 1919

   Sheehan's Pool Room, which adorns one of the lesser alleys in the heart of
   Chicago's stockyard district, is not a nice place. Its air, freighted with
   a thousand odours such as Coleridge may have found at Cologne, too seldom
   knows the purifying rays of the sun; but fights for space with the acrid
   fumes of unnumbered cheap cigars and cigarettes which dangle from the
   coarse lips of unnumbered human animals that haunt the place day and
   night. But the popularity of Sheehan's remains unimpaired; and for this
   there is a reason -- a reason obvious to anyone who will take the trouble
   to analyse the mixed stenches prevailing there. Over and above the fumes
   and sickening closeness rises an aroma once familiar throughout the land,
   but now happily banished to the back streets of life by the edict of a
   benevolent government -- the aroma of strong, wicked whiskey -- a precious
   kind of forbidden fruit indeed in this year of grace 1950.

   Sheehan's is the acknowledged centre to Chicago's subterranean traffic in
   liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which extends even
   to the unkempt attaches of the place; but there was until lately one who
   lay outside the pale of that dignity -- one who shared the squalor and
   filth, but not the importance, of Sheehan's. He was called "Old Bugs", and
   was the most disreputable object in a disreputable environment. What he
   had once been, many tried to guess; for his language and mode of utterance
   when intoxicated to a certain degree were such as to excite wonderment;
   but what he was, presented less difficulty -- for "Old Bugs", in
   superlative degree, epitomised the pathetic species known as the "bum" or
   the "down-and-outer". Whence he had come, no one could tell. One night he
   had burst wildly into Sheehan's, foaming at the mouth and screaming for
   whiskey and hasheesh; and having been supplied in exchange for a promise
   to perform odd jobs, had hung about ever since, mopping floors, cleaning
   cuspidors and glasses, and attending to an hundred similar menial duties
   in exchange for the drink and drugs which were necessary to keep him alive
   and sane.

   He talked but little, and usually in the common jargon of the underworld;
   but occasionally, when inflamed by an unusually generous dose of crude
   whiskey, would burst forth into strings of incomprehensible polysyllables
   and snatches of sonorous prose and verse which led certain habitues to
   conjecture that he had seen better days. One steady patron -- a bank
   defaulter under cover -- came to converse with him quite regularly, and
   from the tone of his discourse ventured the opinion that he had been a
   writer or professor in his day. But the only tangible clue to Old Bugs'
   past was a faded photograph which he constantly carried about with him --
   the photograph of a young woman of noble and beautiful features. This he
   would sometimes draw from his tattered pocket, carefully unwrap from its
   covering of tissue paper, and gaze upon for hours with an expression of
   ineffable sadness and tenderness. It was not the portrait of one whom an
   underworld denizen would be likely to know, but of a lady of breeding and
   quality, garbed in the quaint attire of thirty years before. Old Bugs
   himself seemed also to belong to the past, for his nondescript clothing
   bore every hallmark of antiquity. He was a man of immense height, probably
   more than six feet, though his stooping shoulders sometimes belied this
   fact. His hair, a dirty white and falling out in patches, was never
   combed; and over his lean face grew a mangy stubble of coarse beard which
   seemed always to remain at the bristling stage -- never shaven -- yet
   never long enough to form a respectable set of whiskers. His features had
   perhaps been noble once, but were now seamed with the ghastly effects of
   terrible dissipation. At one time -- probably in middle life -- he had
   evidently been grossly fat; but now he was horribly lean, the purple flesh
   hanging in loose pouches under his bleary eyes and upon his cheeks.
   Altogether, Old Bugs was not pleasing to look upon.

   The disposition of Old Bugs was as odd as his aspect. Ordinarily he was
   true to the derelict type -- ready to do anything for a nickel or a dose
   of whiskey or hasheesh -- but at rare intervals he shewed the traits which
   earned him his name. Then he would try to straighten up, and a certain
   fire would creep into the sunken eyes. His demeanour would assume an
   unwonted grace and even dignity; and the sodden creatures around him would
   sense something of superiority -- something which made them less ready to
   give the usual kicks and cuffs to the poor butt and drudge. At these times
   he would shew a sardonic humour and make remarks which the folk of
   Sheehan's deemed foolish and irrational. But the spells would soon pass,
   and once more Old Bugs would resume his eternal floor-scrubbing and
   cuspidor-cleaning. But for one thing Old Bugs would have been an ideal
   slave to the establishment -- and that one thing was his conduct when
   young men were introduced for their first drink. The old man would then
   rise from the floor in anger and excitement, muttering threats and
   warnings, and seeking to dissuade the novices from embarking upon their
   course of "seeing life as it is." He would sputter and fume, exploding
   into sesquipedalian admonitions and strange oaths, and animated by a
   frightful earnestness which brought a shudder to more than one drug-racked
   mind in the crowded room. But after a time his alcohol-enfeebled brain
   would wander from the subject, and with a foolish grin he would turn once
   more to his mop or cleaning-rag.

   I do not think that many of Sheehan's regular patrons will ever forget the
   day that young Alfred Trever came. He was rather a "find" -- a rich and
   high-spirited youth who would "go the limit" in anything he undertook --
   at least, that was the verdict of Pete Schultz, Sheehan's "runner", who
   had come across the boy at Lawrence College, in the small town of
   Appleton, Wisconsin. Trever was the son of prominent parents in Appleton.
   His father, Karl Trever, was an attorney and citizen of distinction,
   whilst his mother had made an enviable reputation as a poetess under her
   maiden name of Eleanor Wing. Alfred was himself a scholar and poet of
   distinction, though cursed with a certain childish irresponsibility which
   made him an ideal prey for Sheehan's runner. He was blond, handsome, and
   spoiled; vivacious and eager to taste the several forms of dissipation
   about which he had read and heard. At Lawrence he had been prominent in
   the mock-fraternity of "Tappa Tappa Keg", where he was the wildest and
   merriest of the wild and merry young roysterers; but this immature,
   collegiate frivolity did not satisfy him. He knew deeper vices through
   books, and he now longed to know them at first hand. Perhaps this tendency
   toward wildness had been stimulated somewhat by the repression to which he
   had been subjected at home; for Mrs. Trever had particular reason for
   training her only child with rigid severity. She had, in her own youth,
   been deeply and permanently impressed with the horror of dissipation by
   the case of one to whom she had for a time been engaged.

   Young Galpin, the fiance in question, had been one of Appleton's most
   remarkable sons. Attaining distinction as a boy through his wonderful
   mentality, he won vast fame at the University of Wisconsin, and at the age
   of twenty-three returned to Appleton to take up a professorship at
   Lawrence and to slip a diamond upon the finger of Appleton's fairest and
   most brilliant daughter. For a season all went happily, till without
   warning the storm burst. Evil habits, dating from a first drink taken
   years before in woodland seclusion, made themselves manifest in the young
   professor; and only by a hurried resignation did he escape a nasty
   prosecution for injury to the habits and morals of the pupils under his
   charge. His engagement broken, Galpin moved east to begin life anew; but
   before long, Appletonians heard of his dismissal in disgrace from New York
   University, where he had obtained an instructorship in English. Galpin now
   devoted his time to the library and lecture platform, preparing volumes
   and speeches on various subjects connected with belles lettres, and always
   shewing a genius so remarkable that it seemed as if the public must
   sometime pardon him for his past mistakes. His impassioned lectures in
   defence of Villon, Poe, Verlaine, and Oscar Wilde were applied to himself
   as well, and in the short Indian summer of his glory there was talk of a
   renewed engagement at a certain cultured home on Park Avenue. But then the
   blow fell. A final disgrace, compared to which the others had been as
   nothing, shattered the illusions of those who had come to believe in
   Galpin's reform; and the young man abandoned his name and disappeared from
   public view. Rumour now and then associated him with a certain "Consul
   Hasting" whose work for the stage and for motionpicture companies
   attracted a certain degree of attention because of its scholarly breadth
   and depth; but Hasting soon disappeared from the public eye, and Galpin
   became only a name for parents to quote in warning accents. Eleanor Wing
   soon celebrated her marriage to Karl Trever, a rising young lawyer, and of
   her former admirer retained only enough memory to dictate the naming of
   her only son, and the moral guidance of that handsome and headstrong
   youth. Now, in spite of all that guidance, Alfred Trever was at Sheehan's
   and about to take his first drink.

   "Boss," cried Schultz, as he entered the vile-smelling room with his young
   victim, "meet my friend Al Trever, bes' li'1' sport up at Lawrence --
   thas"n Appleton, Wis., y' know. Some swell guy, too -- 's father's a big
   corp'ration lawyer up in his burg, 'n' 's mother's some fiery genius. He
   wants to see life as she is -- wants to know what the real lightnin' juice
   tastes like -- so jus'remember he's me friend an' treat 'im right."

   As the names Trever, Lawrence, and Appleton fell on the air, the loafers
   seemed to sense something unusual. Perhaps it was only some sound
   connected with the clicking balls of the pool tables or the rattling
   glasses that were brought from the cryptic regions in the rear -- perhaps
   only that, plus some strange rustling of the dirty draperies at the one
   dingy window-but many thought that someone in the room had gritted his
   teeth and drawn a very sharp breath.

   "Glad to know you, Sheehan," said Trever in a quiet, well-bred tone.

   "This is my first experience in a place like this, but I am a student of
   life, and don't want to miss any experience. There's poetry in this sort
   of thing, you know -- or perhaps you don't know, but it's all the same.

   "Young feller," responded the proprietor, "ya come tuh th' right place tuh
   see life. We got all kinds here -- reel life an' a good time. The damn'
   government can try tuh make folks good of it wants tuh, but it can't stop
   a feller from hittin"er up when he feels like it. Whaddya want, feller --
   booze, coke, or some other sorta dope? Yuh can't ask for nothin' we ain't
   got."

   Habitues say that it was at this point they noticed a cessation in the
   regular, monotonous strokes of the mop.

   "I want whiskey -- good old-fashioned rye!" exclaimed Trever
   enthusiastically. "I'll tell you, I'm good and tired of water after
   reading of the merry bouts fellows used to have in the old days. I can't
   read an Anacreontic without watering at the mouth -- and it's something a
   lot stronger than water that my mouth waters for!"

   "Anacreontic -- what'n hell's that?" several hangers-on looked up as the
   young man went slightly beyond their depth. But the bank defaulter under
   cover explained to them that Anacreon was a gay old dog who lived many
   years ago and wrote about the fun he had when all the world was just like
   Sheehan's.

   "Let me see, Trever," continued the defaulter, "didn't Schultz say your
   mother is a literary person, too?"

   "Yes, damn it," replied Trever, "but nothing like the old Teian! She's one
   of those dull, eternal moralisers that try to take all the joy out of
   life. Namby-pamby sort -- ever heard of her? She writes under her maiden
   name of Eleanor Wing."

   Here it was that Old Bugs dropped his mop.

   "Well, here's yer stuff," announced Sheehan jovially as a tray of bottles
   and glasses was wheeled into the room. "Good old rye, an' as fiery as ya
   kin find anyw'eres in Chi."

   The youth's eyes glistened and his nostrils curled at the fumes of the
   brownish fluid which an attendant was pouring out for him. It repelled him
   horribly, and revolted all his inherited delicacy; but his determination
   to taste life to the full remained with him, and he maintained a bold
   front. But before his resolution was put to the test, the unexpected
   intervened. Old Bugs, springing up from the crouching position in which he
   had hitherto been, leaped at the youth and dashed from his hands the
   uplifted glass, almost simultaneously attacking the tray of bottles and
   glasses with his mop, and scattering the contents upon the floor in a
   confusion of odoriferous fluid and broken bottles and tumblers. Numbers of
   men, or things which had been men, dropped to the floor and began lapping
   at the puddles of spilled liquor, but most remained immovable, watching
   the unprecedented actions of the barroom drudge and derelict. Old Bugs
   straightened up before the astonished Trever, and in a mild and cultivated
   voice said, "Do not do this thing. I was like you once, and I did it. Now
   I am like -- this."

   "What do you mean, you damned old fool?" shouted Trever. "What do you mean
   by interfering with a gentleman in his pleasures?" Sheehan, now recovering
   from his astonishment, advanced and laid a heavy hand on the old waif's
   shoulder.

   "This is the last time far you, old bird!" he exclaimed furiously. "When a
   gen'l'man wants tuh take a drink here, by God, he shall, without you
   interferin'. Now get th' hell outa here afore I kick hell outa ya."

   But Sheehan had reckoned without scientific knowledge of abnormal
   psychology and the effects of nervous stimulus. Old Bugs, obtaining a
   firmer hold on his mop, began to wield it like the javelin of a Macedonian
   hoplite, and soon cleared a considerable space around himself, meanwhile
   shouting various disconnected bits of quotation, among which was
   prominently repeated, " . . . the sons of Belial, blown with insolence and
   wine."

   The room became pandemonium, and men screamed and howled in fright at the
   sinister being they had aroused. Trever seemed dazed in the confusion, and
   shrank to the wall as the strife thickened. "He shall not drink! He shall
   not drink!" Thus roared Old Bugs as he seemed to run out of -- or rise
   above -- quotations. Policemen appeared at the door, attracted by the
   noise, but for a time they made no move to intervene. Trever, now
   thoroughly terrified and cured forever of his desire to see life via the
   vice route, edged closer to the blue-coated newcomers. Could he but escape
   and catch a train for Appleton, he reflected, he would consider his
   education in dissipation quite complete.

   Then suddenly Old Bugs ceased to wield his javelin and stopped still --
   drawing himself up more erectly than any denizen of the place had ever
   seen him before. "Ave, Caesar, moriturus te saluto!" he shouted, and
   dropped to the whiskey-reeking floor, never to rise again.

   Subsequent impressions will never leave the mind of young Trever. The
   picture is blurred, but ineradicable. Policemen ploughed a way through the
   crowd, questioning everyone closely both about the incident and about the
   dead figure on the floor. Sheehan especially did they ply with inquiries,
   yet without eliciting any information of value concerning Old Bugs. Then
   the bank defaulter remembered the picture, and suggested that it be viewed
   and filed for identification at police headquarters. An officer bent
   reluctantly over the loathsome glassyeyed form and found the
   tissue-wrapped cardboard, which he passed around among the others.

   "Some chicken!" leered a drunken man as he viewed the beautiful face, but
   those who were sober did not leer, looking with respect and abashment at
   the delicate and spiritual features. No one seemed able to place the
   subject, and all wondered that the drug-degraded derelict should have such
   a portrait in his possession -- that is, all but the bank defaulter, who
   was meanwhile eyeing the intruding bluecoats rather uneasily. He had seen
   a little deeper beneath Old Bugs' mask of utter degradation.

   Then the picture was passed to Trever, and a change came over the youth.
   After the first start, he replaced the tissue wrapping around the
   portrait, as if to shield it from the sordidness of the place. Then he
   gazed long and searchingly at the figure on the floor, noting its great
   height, and the aristocratic cast of features which seemed to appear now
   that the wretched flame of life had flickered out. No, he said hastily, as
   the question was put to him, he did not know the subject of the picture.
   It was so old, he added, that no one now could be expected to recognise
   it.

   But Alfred Trever did not speak the truth, as many guessed when he offered
   to take charge of the body and secure its interment in Appleton. Over the
   library mantel in his home hung the exact replica of that picture, and all
   his life he had known and loved its original.

   For the gentle and noble features were those of his own mother.
