				<p>Where bay and river tranquil blend,
				<br>And leafy hillsides rise,
				<br>The spires of Providence ascend
				<br>Against the ancient skies,
				<br>And in the narrow winding ways
				<br>That climb o'er slope and crest,
				<br>The magic of forgotten days
				<br>May still be found to rest.
				<br>A fanlight's gleam, a knocker's blow,
				<br>A glimpse of Georgian brick -
				<br>The sights and sounds of long ago
				<br>Where fancies cluster thick.
				<br>A flight of steps with iron rail,
				<br>A belfry looming tall,
				<br>A slender steeple, carved and pale,
				<br>A moss-grown garden wall.
				<br>A hidden churchyard's crumbling proofs
				<br>Of man's mortality,
				<br>A rotting wharf where gambrel roofs
				<br>Keep watch above the sea.
				<br>Square and parade, whose walls have towered
				<br>Full fifteen decades long
				<br>By cobbled ways 'mid trees embowered,
				<br>And slighted by the throng.
				<br>Stone bridges spanning languid streams,
				<br>Houses perched on the hill,
				<br>And courts where mysteries and dreams
				<br>The brooding spirit fill.
				<br>Steep alley steps by vines concealed,
				<br>Where small-paned windows glow
				<br>At twilight on a bit of field
				<br>That chance has left below.
				<br>My Providence!  What airy hosts
				<br>Turn still thy gilded vanes;
				<br>What winds of elf that with grey ghosts
				<br>People thine ancient lanes!
				<br>The chimes of evening as of old
				<br>Above thy valleys sound,
				<br>While thy stern fathers 'neath the mould
				<br>Make blest thy sacred ground.
