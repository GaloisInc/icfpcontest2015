   Upon an eroded cliff-top rested the man, gazing far across the valley.
   Lying thus, he could see a great distance, but in all the sere expanse
   there was no visible motion. Nothing stirred the dusty plain, the
   disintegrated sand of long-dry river-beds, where once coursed the gushing
   streams of Earth's youth. There was little greenery in this ultimate
   world, this final stage of mankind's prolonged presence upon the planet.
   For unnumbered aeons the drought and sandstorms had ravaged all the lands.
   The trees and bushes had given way to small, twisted shrubs that persisted
   long through their sturdiness; but these, in turn, perished before the
   onslaught of coarse grasses and stringy, tough vegetation of strange
   evolution.

   The ever-present heat, as Earth drew nearer to the sun, withered and
   killed with pitiless rays. It had not come at once; long aeons had gone
   before any could feel the change. And all through those first ages man's
   adaptable form had followed the slow mutation and modelled itself to fit
   the more and more torrid air. then the day had come when men could bear
   their hot cities but ill, and a gradual recession began, slow yet
   deliberate. Those towns and settlements closest to the equator had been
   first, of course, but later there were others. Man, softened and
   exhausted, could cope no longer with the ruthlessly mounting heat. It
   seared him as he was, and evolution was too slow to mould new resistances
   in him.

   Yet not at first were the great cities of the equator left to the spider
   and the scorpion. In the early years there were many who stayed on,
   devising curious shields and armours against the heat and the deadly
   dryness. These fearless souls, screening certain buildings against the
   encroaching sun, made miniature worlds of marvellously ingenious things,
   so that for a while men persisted in the rusting towers, hoping thereby to
   cling to old lands till the searing should be over. For many would not
   believe what the astronomers said, and looked for a coming of the mild
   olden world again. But one day the men of Dath, from the new city of
   Niyara, made signals to Yuanario, their immemorially ancient capital, and
   gained no answer from the few who remained therein. And when explorers
   reached that millennial city of bridge-linked towers they found only
   silence. There was not even the horror of corruption, for the scavenger
   lizards had been swift.

   Only then did the people fully realize that these cities were lost to
   them; know that they must forever abandon them to nature. The other
   colonists in the hot lands fled from their brave posts, and total silence
   reigned within the high basalt walls of a thousand empty towns. Of the
   denser throngs and multitudinous activities of the past, nothing finally
   remained. There now loomed against the rainless deserts only the blistered
   towers of vacant houses, factories, and structures of every sort,
   reflecting the sun's dazzling radiance and parching in the more and more
   intolerable heat.

   Many lands, however, had still escaped the scorching blight, so that the
   refugees were soon absorbed in the life of a newer world. During strangely
   prosperous centuries the hoary deserted cities of the equator grew
   half-forgotten and entwined with fantastic fables. Few thought of those
   spectral, rotting towers...those huddles of shabby walls and cactus-choked
   streets, darkly silent and abandoned...

   Wars came, sinful and prolonged, but the times of peace were greater. Yet
   always the swollen sun increased its radiance as Earth drew closer to its
   fiery parent. It was as if the planet meant to return to that source
   whence it was snatched, aeons ago, through the accidents of cosmic growth.

   After a time the blight crept outward from the central belt. Southern
   Yarat burned as a tenantless desert - and then the north. In Perath and
   Baling, those ancient cities where brooding centuries dwelt, there moved
   only the scaly shapes of the serpent and the salamander, and at last Loron
   echoed only to the fitful falling of tottering spires and crumbling domes.

   Steady, universal, and inexorable was the great eviction of man from the
   realms he had always known. No land within the widening stricken belt was
   spared; no people left unrouted. It was an epic, a titan tragedy whose
   plot was unrevealed to the actors - this wholesale desertion of the cities
   of men. It took not years or even centuries, but millennia of ruthless
   change. And still it kept on - sullen, inevitable, savagely devastating.

   Agriculture was at a standstill, the world fast became too arid for crops.
   This was remedied by artificial substitutes, soon universally used. And as
   the old places that had known the great things of mortals were left, the
   loot salvaged by the fugitives grew smaller and smaller. Things of the
   greatest value and importance were left in dead museums - lost amid the
   centuries - and in the end the heritage of the immemorial past was
   abandoned. A degeneracy both physical and cultural set in with the
   insidious heat. For man had so long dwelt in comfort and security that
   this exodus from past scenes was difficult. Nor were these events received
   phlegmatically; their very slowness was terrifying. Degradation and
   debauchery were soon common; government was disorganized, and the
   civilization aimlessly slid back toward barbarism.

   When, forty-nine centuries after the blight from the equatorial belt, the
   whole western hemisphere was left unpeopled, chaos was complete. There was
   no trace of order or decency in the last scenes of this titanic, wildly
   impressive migration. Madness and frenzy stalked through them, and
   fanatics screamed of an Armageddon close at hand.

   Mankind was now a pitiful remnant of the elder races, a fugitive not only
   from the prevailing conditions, but from his own degeneracy. Into the
   northland and the antarctic went those who could; the rest lingered for
   years in an incredible saturnalia, vaguely doubting the forthcoming
   disasters. In the city of Borligo a wholesale execution of the new
   prophets took place, after months of unfulfilled expectations. They
   thought the flight to the northland unnecessary, and no longer looked for
   the threatened ending.

   How they perished must have been terrible indeed - those vain, foolish
   creatures who thought to defy the universe. But the blackened, scorched
   towers are mute...

   These events, however, must not be chronicled - for there are larger
   things to consider then this complex and unhastening downfall of a lost
   civilization. During a long period morale was at lowest ebb among the
   courageous few who settled upon the alien arctic and antarctic shores, now
   mild as were those of southern Yarat in the long-dead past. But here there
   was respite. The soil was fertile, and forgotten pastoral arts were called
   into use anew. There was, for a long time, a contented little epitome of
   the lost lands; though here were no vast throngs or great buildings. Only
   a sparse remnant of humanity survived the aeons of change and peopled
   those scattered villages of the later world.

   How many millenia this continued is not known. The sun was slow in
   invading this last retreat; and as the eras passed there developed a
   sound, sturdy race, bearing no memories or legends of the old, lost lands.
   Little navigation was practiced by this new people, and the flying machine
   was wholly forgotten. Their devices were of the simplest type, and their
   culture was simple and primitive. Yet they were contented, and accepted
   the warm climate as something natural and accustomed.

   But unknown to these simple peasant-folk, still further rigours of nature
   were slowly preparing themselves. As the generations passed, the waters of
   the vast and unplumbed ocean wasted slowly away; enriching the air and the
   desiccated soil, but sinking lower and lower each century. The splashing
   surf still glistened bright, and the swirling eddies were still there, but
   a doom of dryness hung over the whole watery expanse. However, the
   shrinkage could not have been detected save by instruments more delicate
   than any then known to the race. Even had the people realized the ocean's
   contraction, it is not likely that any vast alarm or great disturbace
   would have resulted, for the losses were so slight, and the sea so
   great...Only a few inches during many centuries - but in many centuries;
   increasing -

                                     * * *

   So at last the oceans went, and water became a rarity on a globe of
   sun-baked drought. Man had slowly spread over all the arctic and antarctic
   lands; the equatorial cities, and many of later habitation, were forgotten
   even to legend.

   And now again the peace was disturbed, for water was scarce, and found
   only in deep caverns. There was little enough, even of this; and men died
   of thirst wandering in far places. Yet so slow were those deadly changes,
   that each new generation of man was loath to believe what it heard from
   its parents. None would admit that the heat had been less or the water
   more plentiful in the old days, or take warning that days of bitterer
   burning and drought were to come. Thus it was even at the end, when only a
   few hundred human creatures panted for breath beneath the cruel sun; a
   piteous huddled handful out of all the unnumbered millions who had once
   dwelt on the doomed planet.

   And the hundreds became small, till man was to be reckoned only in tens.
   These tens clung to the shrinking dampness of the caves, and knew at last
   at the end was near. So slight was their range that none had ever seen the
   tiny, fabled spots of ice left close to the parent's poles - if indeed
   such remained. Even had they existed and been known to man, none could
   have reached them across the trackless and formidable deserts. And so the
   last pathetic few dwindled...

   It cannot be described, this awesome chain of events that depopulated the
   whole Earth; the range is too tremendous for any to picture or encompass.
   Of the people of Earth's fortunate ages, billions of years before, only a
   few prophets and madmen could have conceived that which was to come -
   could have grasped visions of the still, dead lands, and long-empty
   sea-beds. The rest would have doubted...doubted alike the shadow of change
   upon the planet and the shadow of doom upon the race. For man has always
   thought himself the immortal master of natural things...

   When he had eased the dying pangs of the old woman, Ull wandered in a
   fearful daze out into the dazzling sands. She had been a fearsome thing,
   shrivelled and so dry; like withered leaves. Her face had been the colour
   of the sickly yellow grasses that rustled in the hot wind, and she was
   loathsomely old.

   But she had been a companion; someone to stammer out vague fears to, to
   talk to about this incredible thing; a comrade to share one's hopes for
   succour from those silent other colonies beyond the mountains. He could
   not believe none lived elsewhere, for Ull was young, and not certain as
   are the old.

   For many years he had known none but the old woman - her name was Mladdna.
   She had come that day in his eleventh year, when all the hunters went to
   seek food, and did not return. Ull had no mother that he could remember,
   and there were few women in the tiny group. When the men had vanished,
   those three women, the young one and the two old, had screamed fearfully,
   and moaned long. Then the young one had gone mad, and killed herself with
   a sharp stick. The old ones buried her in a shallow hole dug with their
   nails, so Ull had been alone when this still older Mladdna came.

   She walked with the aid of a knotty pole, a priceless relique of the old
   forests, hard and shiny with years of use. She did not say whence she
   came, but stumbled into the cabin while the young suicide was being
   buried. There she waited till the two returned, and they accepted her
   incuriously.

   That was the way it had been for many weeks, until the two fell sick, and
   Mladdna could not cure them. strange that those younger two should have
   been stricken, while she, infirm and ancient, lived on. Mladdna had cared
   for them many days, and at length they died, so that Ull was left with
   only the stranger. He screamed all the night, so she became at length out
   of patience, and threatened to die too. Then, hearkening, he became quiet
   at once; for he was not desirous of complete solitude. After that he lived
   with Mladdna and they gathered roots to eat.

   Mladdna's rotten teeth were ill suited to the food they gathered, but they
   continued to chop it up till she could manage it. This weary routine of
   seeking and eating was Ull's childhood.

   Now he was strong, and firm, in his nineteenth year, and the old woman was
   dead. There was naught to stay for, so he determined at once to seek out
   those fabled huts beyond the mountains, and live with the people there.
   There was nothing to take on the journey. Ull closed the door of his cabin
   - why, he could not have told, for no animals had been there for many
   years - and left the dead woman within. Half-dazed, and fearful at his own
   audacity, he walked long hours in the dry grasses, and at length reached
   the first of the foothills. The afternoon came, and he climbed until he
   was weary, and lay down on the grasses. Sprawled there, he thought of many
   things. He wondered at the strange life, passionately anxious to seek out
   the lost colony beyond the mountains; but at last he slept.

   When he awoke there was starlight on his face, and he felt refreshed. Now
   that the sun was gone for a time, he travelled more quickly, eating
   little, and determining to hasten before the lack of water became
   difficult to bear. He had brought none; for the last people, dwelling in
   one place and never having occasion to bear their precious water away,
   made no vessels of any kind. Ull hoped to reach his goal within a day, and
   thus escape thirst; so he hurried on beneath the bright stars, running at
   times in the warm air, and at other times lapsing into a dogtrot.

   So he continued until the sun arose, yet still he was within the small
   hills, with three great peaks looming ahead. In their shade he rested
   again. then he climbed all the morning, and at mid-day surmounted the
   first peak, where he lay for a time, surveying the space before the next
   range.

   Upon an eroded cliff-top rested the man, gazing far across the valley.
   Lying thus he could see a great distance, but in all the sere expanse
   there was no visible motion...

   The second night came, and found Ull amid the rough peaks, the valley and
   the place where he had rested far behind. He was nearly out of the second
   range now, and hurrying still. Thirst had come upon him that day, and he
   regretted his folly. Yet he could not have stayed there with the corpse,
   alone in the grasslands. He sought to convince himself thus, and hastened
   ever on, tiredly straining.

   And now there only a few steps before the cliff wall would part and allow
   a view of the land beyond. Ull stumbled wearily down the stony way,
   tumbling and bruising himself even more. It was nearly before him, this
   land of which he had heard tales in his youth. The way was long, but the
   goal was great. A boulder of giant circumference cut off his view; upon
   this he scrambled anxiously. Now at last he could behold by the sinking
   orb his long-sought destination, and his thirst and aching muscles were
   forgotten as he saw joyfully that a small huddle of buildings clung to the
   base of the farther cliff.

   Ull rested not; but, spurred on by what he saw, ran and staggered and
   crawled the half mile remaining. He fancied that he could detect forms
   among the rude cabins. The sun was nearly gone; the hateful, devastating
   sun that had slain humanity. He could not be sure of details, but soon the
   cabins were near.

   They were very old, for clay blocks lasted long in the still dryness of
   the dying world. Little, indeed, changed but the living things - the
   grasses and these last men.

   Before him an open door swung upon rude pegs. In the fading ligh Ull
   entered, weary unto death, seeking painfully the expected faces.

   Then he fell upon the floor and wept, for at the table was propped a dry
   and ancient skeleton.

                                     * * *

   He rose at last, crazed by thirst, aching unbearably, and suffering the
   greatest disappointment nay mortal could know. He was, then, the last
   living thing upon the globe. His the heritage of the Earth... all the
   lands, and all to him equally useless. He staggered up, not looking at the
   dim white form in the reflected moonlight, and went through the door.
   About the empty village he wandered, searching for water and sadly
   inspecting this long-empty place so spectrally preserved by the changeless
   air. here there was a dwelling, there a rude place where things had been
   made - clay vessels holding only dust, and nowhere any liquid to quench
   his burning thirst.

   Then, in the centre of the little town, Ull saw a well-curb. He knew what
   it was, for he had heard tales of such thing from Mladdna. With pitiful
   joy, he reeled forward and leaned upon the edge. There, at last, was the
   end of his search. Water - slimy, stagnant, and shallow, but water -
   before his sight.

   Ull cried out in the voice of a tortured animal, groping for the chain and
   bucket. His hand slipped on the slimy edge; and he fell upon his chest
   across the brink. For a moment he lay there - then soundlessly his body
   was precipitated down the black shaft.

   There was a slight splash in the murky shallowness as he struck some
   long-sunken stone, dislodged aeons ago from the massive coping. The
   disturbed water subsided into quietness.

   And now at last the Earth was dead. The final, pitiful survivor had
   perished. All the teeming billions; the slow aeons; the empires and
   civilizations of mankind were summed up in this poor twisted form - and
   how titanically meaningless it all had been! Now indeed had come an end
   and climax to all the efforts of humanity - how monstrous and incredible a
   climax in the eyes of those poor complacent fools of the prosperous days!
   Not ever again would the planet know the thunderous rampaging of human
   millions - or even the crawling of lizards and the buzz of insects, for
   they, too, had gone. now was come the reign of sapless branches and
   endless fields of tough grasses. Earth, like its cold, imperturbable moon,
   was given over to silence and blackness forever.

   The stars whirred on; the whole careless plan would continue for
   infinities unknown. This trivial end of a negligible episode mattered not
   to distant nebulae or to suns new-born, flourishing, and dying. The race
   of man, too puny and momentary to have a real function or purpose, was as
   if it had never existed. To such a conclusion the aeons of its farcically
   toilsome evolution had led.

   But when the deadly sun's first rays darted across the valley, a light
   found its way to the weary face of a broken figure that lay in the slime.
