Providence

  by H. P. Lovecraft

  Written May 1924

                  Where bay and river tranquil blend,         
                  And leafy hillsides rise,                   
                  The spires of Providence ascend             
                  Against the ancient skies,                  
                  And in the narrow winding ways              
                  That climb o'er slope and crest,            
                  The magic of forgotten days                 
                  May still be found to rest.                 
                  A fanlight's gleam, a knocker's blow,       
                  A glimpse of Georgian brick -               
                  The sights and sounds of long ago           
                  Where fancies cluster thick.                
                  A flight of steps with iron rail,           
                  A belfry looming tall,                      
                  A slender steeple, carved and pale,         
                  A moss-grown garden wall.                   
                  A hidden churchyard's crumbling proofs      
                  Of man's mortality,                         
                  A rotting wharf where gambrel roofs         
                  Keep watch above the sea.                   
                  Square and parade, whose walls have towered 
                  Full fifteen decades long                   
                  By cobbled ways 'mid trees embowered,       
                  And slighted by the throng.                 
                  Stone bridges spanning languid streams,     
                  Houses perched on the hill,                 
                  And courts where mysteries and dreams       
                  The brooding spirit fill.                   
                  Steep alley steps by vines concealed,       
                  Where small-paned windows glow              
                  At twilight on a bit of field               
                  That chance has left below.                 
                  My Providence! What airy hosts              
                  Turn still thy gilded vanes;                
                  What winds of elf that with grey ghosts     
                  People thine ancient lanes!                 
                  The chimes of evening as of old             
                  Above thy valleys sound,                    
                  While thy stern fathers 'neath the mould    
                  Make blest thy sacred ground.
