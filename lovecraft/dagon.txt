   I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I
   shall be no more. Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug which
   alone, makes life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and shall
   cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below. Do not
   think from my slavery to morphine that I am a weakling or a degenerate.
   When you have read these hastily scrawled pages you may guess, though
   never fully realise, why it is that I must have forgetfulness or death.

   It was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad
   Pacific that the packet of which I was supercargo fell a victim to the
   German sea-raider. The great war was then at its very beginning, and the
   ocean forces of the Hun had not completely sunk to their later
   degradation; so that our vessel was made a legitimate prize, whilst we of
   her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as
   naval prisoners. So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of our captors,
   that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a small
   boat with water and provisions for a good length of time.

   When I finally found myself adrift and free, I had but little idea of my
   surroundings. Never a competent navigator, I could only guess vaguely by
   the sun and stars that I was somewhat south of the equator. Of the
   longitude I knew nothing, and no island or coastline was in sight. The
   weather kept fair, and for uncounted days I drifted aimlessly beneath the
   scorching sun; waiting either for some passing ship, or to be cast on the
   shores of some habitable land. But neither ship nor land appeared, and I
   began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving vastness of unbroken
   blue.

   The change happened whilst I slept. Its details I shall never know; for my
   slumber, though troubled and dream-infested, was continuous. When at last
   I awakened, it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of
   hellish black mire which extended about me in monotonous undulations as
   far as I could see, and in which my boat lay grounded some distance away.

   Though one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of wonder
   at so prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery, I was in
   reality more horrified than astonished; for there was in the air and in
   the rotting soil a sinister quality which chilled me to the very core. The
   region was putrid with the carcasses of decaying fish, and of other less
   describable things which I saw protruding from the nasty mud of the
   unending plain. Perhaps I should not hope to convey in mere words the
   unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute silence and barren
   immensity. There was nothing within hearing, and nothing in sight save a
   vast reach of black slime; yet the very completeness of the stillness and
   the homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a nauseating fear.

   The sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost black in its
   cloudless cruelty; as though reflecting the inky marsh beneath my feet. As
   I crawled into the stranded boat I realised that only one theory could
   explain my position. Through some unprecedented volcanic upheaval, a
   portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown to the surface, exposing
   regions which for innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under
   unfathomable watery depths. So great was the extent of the new land which
   had risen beneath me, that I could not detect the faintest noise of the
   surging ocean, strain my ears as I might. Nor were there any sea-fowl to
   prey upon the dead things.

   For several hours I sat thinking or brooding in the boat, which lay upon
   its side and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across the heavens.
   As the day progressed, the ground lost some of its stickiness, and seemed
   likely to dry sufficiently for travelling purposes in a short time. That
   night I slept but little, and the next day I made for myself a pack
   containing food and water, preparatory to an overland journey in search of
   the vanished sea and possible rescue.

   On the third morning I found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease.
   The odour of the fish was maddening; but I was too much concerned with
   graver things to mind so slight an evil, and set out boldly for an unknown
   goal. All day I forged steadily westward, guided by a far-away hummock
   which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert. That
   night I encamped, and on the following day still travelled toward the
   hummock, though that object seemed scarcely nearer than when I had first
   espied it. By the fourth evening I attained the base of the mound, which
   turned out to be much higher than it had appeared from a distance, an
   intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the general
   surface. Too weary to ascend, I slept in the shadow of the hill.

   I know not why my dreams were so wild that night; but ere the waning and
   fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern plain, I was
   awake in a cold perspiration, determined to sleep no more. Such visions as
   I had experienced were too much for me to endure again. And in the glow of
   the moon I saw how unwise I had been to travel by day. Without the glare
   of the parching sun, my journey would have cost me less energy; indeed, I
   now felt quite able to perform the ascent which had deterred me at sunset.
   Picking up my pack, I started for the crest of the eminence.

   I have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a source
   of vague horror to me; but I think my horror was greater when I gained the
   summit of the mound and looked down the other side into an immeasurable
   pit or canyon, whose black recesses the moon had not yet soared high
   enough to illumine. I felt myself on the edge of the world, peering over
   the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night. Through my terror ran
   curious reminiscences of Paradise Lost, and Satan's hideous climb through
   the unfashioned realms of darkness.

   As the moon climbed higher in the sky, I began to see that the slopes of
   the valley were not quite so perpendicular as I had imagined. Ledges and
   outcroppings of rock afforded fairly easy footholds for a descent, whilst
   after a drop of a few hundred feet, the declivity became very gradual.
   Urged on by an impulse which I cannot definitely analyse, I scrambled with
   difficulty down the rocks and stood on the gentler slope beneath, gazing
   into the Stygian deeps where no light had yet penetrated.

   All at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the
   opposite slope, which rose steeply about a hundred yards ahead of me; an
   object that gleamed whitely in the newly bestowed rays of the ascending
   moon. That it was merely a gigantic piece of stone, I soon assured myself;
   but I was conscious of a distinct impression that its contour and position
   were not altogether the work of Nature. A closer scrutiny filled me with
   sensations I cannot express; for despite its enormous magnitude, and its
   position in an abyss which had yawned at the bottom of the sea since the
   world was young, I perceived beyond a doubt that the strange object was a
   well-shaped monolith whose massive bulk had known the workmanship and
   perhaps the worship of living and thinking creatures.

   Dazed and frightened, yet not without a certain thrill of the scientist's
   or archaeologist's delight, I examined my surroundings more closely. The
   moon, now near the zenith, shone weirdly and vividly above the towering
   steeps that hemmed in the chasm, and revealed the fact that a far-flung
   body of water flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both
   directions, and almost lapping my feet as I stood on the slope. Across the
   chasm, the wavelets washed the base of the Cyclopean monolith, on whose
   surface I could now trace both inscriptions and crude sculptures. The
   writing was in a system of hieroglyphics unknown to me, and unlike
   anything I had ever seen in books, consisting for the most part of
   conventionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes, eels, octopi,
   crustaceans, molluscs, whales and the like. Several characters obviously
   represented marine things which are unknown to the modern world, but whose
   decomposing forms I had observed on the ocean-risen plain.

   It was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me
   spellbound. Plainly visible across the intervening water on account of
   their enormous size was an array of bas-reliefs whose subjects would have
   excited the envy of a Dore. I think that these things were supposed to
   depict men -- at least, a certain sort of men; though the creatures were
   shown disporting like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto, or
   paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the
   waves as well. Of their faces and forms I dare not speak in detail, for
   the mere remembrance makes me grow faint. Grotesque beyond the imagination
   of a Poe or a Bulwer, they were damnably human in general outline despite
   webbed hands and feet, shockingly wide and flabby lips, glassy, bulging
   eyes, and other features less pleasant to recall. Curiously enough, they
   seemed to have been chiselled badly out of proportion with their scenic
   background; for one of the creatures was shown in the act of killing a
   whale represented as but little larger than himself. I remarked, as I say,
   their grotesqueness and strange size; but in a moment decided that they
   were merely the imaginary gods of some primitive fishing or seafaring
   tribe; some tribe whose last descendant had perished eras before the first
   ancestor of the Piltdown or Neanderthal Man was born. Awestruck at this
   unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception of the most daring
   anthropologist, I stood musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on
   the silent channel before me.

   Then suddenly I saw it. With only a slight churning to mark its rise to
   the surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters. Vast,
   Polyphemus-like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of
   nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms,
   the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured
   sounds. I think I went mad then.

   Of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff, and of my delirious journey
   back to the stranded boat, I remember little. I believe I sang a great
   deal, and laughed oddly when I was unable to sing. I have indistinct
   recollections of a great storm some time after I reached the boat; at any
   rate, I knew that I heard peals of thunder and other tones which Nature
   utters only in her wildest moods.

   When I came out of the shadows I was in a San Francisco hospital; brought
   thither by the captain of the American ship which had picked up my boat in
   mid-ocean. In my delirium I had said much, but found that my words had
   been given scant attention. Of any land upheaval in the Pacific, my
   rescuers knew nothing; nor did I deem it necessary to insist upon a thing
   which I knew they could not believe. Once I sought out a celebrated
   ethnologist, and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient
   Philistine legend of Dagon, the Fish-God; but soon perceiving that he was
   hopelessly conventional, I did not press my inquiries.

   It is at night, especially when the moon is gibbous and waning, that I see
   the thing. I tried morphine; but the drug has given only transient
   surcease, and has drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless slave. So now I
   am to end it all, having written a full account for the information or the
   contemptuous amusement of my fellow-men. Often I ask myself if it could
   not all have been a pure phantasm -- a mere freak of fever as I lay
   sun-stricken and raving in the open boat after my escape from the German
   man-of-war. This I ask myself, but ever does there come before me a
   hideously vivid vision in reply. I cannot think of the deep sea without
   shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be crawling
   and floundering on its slimy bed, worshipping their ancient stone idols
   and carving their own detestable likenesses on submarine obelisks of
   water-soaked granite. I dream of a day when they may rise above the
   billows to drag down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny,
   war-exhausted mankind -- of a day when the land shall sink, and the dark
   ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal pandemonium.

   The end is near. I hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery
   body lumbering against it. It shall not find me. God, that hand! The
   window! The window!
