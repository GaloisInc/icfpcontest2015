   Mystery attracts mystery. Ever since the wide appearance of my name as a
   performer of unexplained feats, I have encountered strange narratives and
   events which my calling has led people to link with my interests and
   activities. Some of these have been trivial and irrelevant, some deeply
   dramatic and absorbing, some productive of weird and perilous experiences
   and some involving me in extensive scientific and historical research.
   Many of these matters I have told and shall continue to tell very freely;
   but there is one of which I speak with great reluctance, and which I am
   now relating only after a session of grilling persuasion from the
   publishers of this magazine, who had heard vague rumors of it from other
   members of my family.

   The hitherto guarded subject pertains to my non-professional visit to
   Egypt fourteen years ago, and has been avoided by me for several reasons.
   For one thing, I am averse to exploiting certain unmistakably actual facts
   and conditions obviously unknown to the myriad tourists who throng about
   the pyramids and apparently secreted with much diligence by the
   authorities at Cairo, who cannot be wholly ignorant of them. For another
   thing, I dislike to recount an incident in which my own fantastic
   imagination must have played so great a part. What I saw - or thought I
   saw - certainly did not take place; but is rather to be viewed as a result
   of my then recent readings in Egyptology, and of the speculations anent
   this theme which my environment naturally prompted. These imaginative
   stimuli, magnified by the excitement of an actual event terrible enough in
   itself, undoubtedly gave rise to the culminating horror of that grotesque
   night so long past.

   In January, 1910, I had finished a professional engagement in England and
   signed a contract for a tour of Australian theatres. A liberal time being
   allowed for the trip, I determined to make the most of it in the sort of
   travel which chiefly interests me; so accompanied by my wife I drifted
   pleasantly down the Continent and embarked at Marseilles on the P & O
   Steamer Malwa, bound for Port Said. From that point I proposed to visit
   the principal historical localities of lower Egypt before leaving finally
   for Australia.

   The voyage was an agreeable one, and enlivened by many of the amusing
   incidents which befall a magical performer apart from his work. I had
   intended, for the sake of quiet travel, to keep my name a secret; but was
   goaded into betraying myself by a fellow-magician whose anxiety to astound
   the passengers with ordinary tricks tempted me to duplicate and exceed his
   feats in a manner quite destructive of my incognito. I mention this
   because of its ultimate effect - an effect I should have foreseen before
   unmasking to a shipload of tourists about to scatter throughout the Nile
   valley. What it did was to herald my identity wherever I subsequently
   went, and deprive my wife and me of all the placid inconspicuousness we
   had sought. Traveling to seek curiosities, I was often forced to stand
   inspection as a sort of curiosity myself!

   We had come to Egypt in search of the picturesque and the mystically
   impressive, but found little enough when the ship edged up to Port Said
   and discharged its passengers in small boats. Low dunes of sand, bobbing
   buoys in shallow water, and a drearily European small town with nothing of
   interest save the great De Lesseps statue, made us anxious to get to
   something more worth our while. After some discussion we decided to
   proceed at once to Cairo and the Pyramids, later going to Alexandria for
   the Australian boat and for whatever Greco-Roman sights that ancient
   metropolis might present.

   The railway journey was tolerable enough, and con sumed only four hours
   and a half. We saw much of the Suez Canal, whose route we followed as far
   as Ismailiya and later had a taste of Old Egypt in our glimpse of the
   restored fresh-water canal of the Middle Empire. Then at last we saw Cairo
   glimmering through the growing dusk; a winkling constellation which became
   a blaze as we halted at the great Gare Centrale.

   But once more disappointment awaited us, for all that we beheld was
   European save the costumes and the crowds. A prosaic subway led to a
   square teeming with carriages, taxicabs, and trolley-cars and gorgeous
   with electric lights shining on tall buildings; whilst the very theatre
   where I was vainly requested to play and which I later attended as a
   spectator, had recently been renamed the 'American Cosmograph'. We stopped
   at Shepheard's Hotel, reached in a taxi that sped along broad, smartly
   built-up streets; and amidst the perfect service of its restaurant,
   elevators and generally Anglo-American luxuries the mysterious East and
   immemorial past seemed very far away.

   The next day, however, precipitated us delightfully into the heart of the
   Arabian Nights atmosphere; and in the winding ways and exotic skyline of
   Cairo, the Bagdad of Harun-al-Rashid seemed to live again. Guided by our
   Baedeker, we had struck east past the Ezbekiyeh Gardens along the Mouski
   in quest of the native quarter, and were soon in the hands of a clamorous
   cicerone who - notwith standing later developments - was assuredly a
   master at his trade.

   Not until afterward did I see that I should have applied at the hotel for
   a licensed guide. This man, a shaven, peculiarly hollow-voiced and
   relatively cleanly fellow who looked like a Pharaoh and called himself
   'Abdul Reis el Drogman' appeared to have much power over others of his
   kind; though subsequently the police professed not to know him, and to
   suggest that reis is merely a name for any person in authority, whilst
   'Drogman' is obviously no more than a clumsy modification of the word for
   a leader of tourist parties - dragoman.

   Abdul led us among such wonders as we had before only read and dreamed of.
   Old Cairo is itself a story-book and a dream - labyrinths of narrow alleys
   redolent of aromatic secrets; Arabesque balconies and oriels nearly
   meeting above the cobbled streets; maelstroms of Oriental traffic with
   strange cries, cracking whips, rattling carts, jingling money, and braying
   donkeys; kaleidoscopes of polychrome robes, veils, turbans, and tarbushes;
   water-carriers and dervishes, dogs and cats, soothsayers and barbers; and
   over all the whining of blind beggars crouched in alcoves, and the
   sonorous chanting of muezzins from minarets limned delicately against a
   sky of deep, unchanging blue.

   The roofed, quieter bazaars were hardly less alluring. Spice, perfume,
   incense beads, rugs, silks, and brass - old Mahmoud Suleiman squats
   cross-legged amidst his gummy bottles while chattering youths pulverize
   mustard in the hollowed-out capital of an ancient classic column - a Roman
   Corinthian, perhaps from neighboring Heliopolis, where Augustus stationed
   one of his three Egyptian legions. Antiquity begins to mingle with
   exoticism. And then the mosques and the museum - we saw them all, and
   tried not to let our Arabian revel succumb to the darker charm of
   Pharaonic Egypt which the museum's priceless treasures offered. That was
   to be our climax, and for the present we concentrated on the mediaeval
   Saracenic glories of the Califs whose magnificent tomb-mosques form a
   glittering faery necropolis on the edge of the Arabian Desert.

   At length Abdul took us along the Sharia Mohammed Ali to the ancient
   mosque of Sultan Hassan, and the tower-flanked Babel-Azab, beyond which
   climbs the steep-walled pass to the mighty citadel that Saladin himself
   built with the stones of forgotten pyramids. It was sunset when we scaled
   that cliff, circled the modern mosque of Mohammed Ali, and looked down
   from the dizzy parapet over mystic Cairo - mystic Cairo all golden with
   its carven domes, its ethereal minarets and its flaming gardens.

   Far over the city towered the great Roman dome of the new museum; and
   beyond it - across the cryptic yellow Nile that is the mother of eons and
   dynasties - lurked the menacing sands of the Libyan Desert, undulant and
   iridesc ent and evil with older arcana.

   The red sun sank low, bringing the relentless chill of Egyptian dusk; and
   as it stood poised on the world's rim like that ancient god of Heliopolis
   - Re-Harakhte, the Horizon-Sun - we saw silhouetted against its vermeil
   holocaust the black outlines of the Pyramids of Gizeh - the palaeogean
   tombs there were hoary with a thousand years when Tut-Ankh-Amen mounted
   his golden throne in distant Thebes. Then we knew that we were done with
   Saracen Cairo, and that we must taste the deeper mysteries of primal Egypt
   - the black Kem of Re and Amen, Isis and Osiris.

   The next morning we visited the Pyramids, riding out in a Victoria across
   the island of Chizereh with its massive lebbakh trees, and the smaller
   English bridge to the western shore. Down the shore road we drove, between
   great rows of lebbakhs and past the vast Zoological Gardens to the suburb
   of Gizeh, where a new bridge to Cairo proper has since been built. Then,
   turning inland along the Sharia-el-Haram, we crossed a region of glassy
   canals and shabby native villages till before us loomed the objects of our
   quest, cleaving the mists of dawn and forming inverted replicas in the
   roadside pools. Forty centuries, as Napoleon had told his campaigners
   there, indeed looked down upon us.

   The road now rose abruptly, till we finally reached our place of transfer
   between the trolley station and the Mena House Hotel. Abdul Reis, who
   capably purchased our Pyramid tickets, seemed to have an understanding
   with the crowding, yelling and offensive Bedouins who inhabited a squalid
   mud village some distance away and pestiferously assailed every traveler;
   for he kept them very decently at bay and secured an excellent pair of
   camels for us, himself mounting a donkey and assigning the leadership of
   our animals to a group of men and boys more expensive than useful. The
   area to be traversed was so small that camels were hardly needed, but we
   did not regret adding to our experience this troublesome form of desert
   navigation.

   The pyramids stand on a high rock plateau, this group forming next to the
   northernmost of the series of regal and aristocratic cemeteries built in
   the neighborhood of the extinct capital Memphis, which lay on the same
   side of the Nile, somewhat south of Gizeh, and which flourished between
   3400 and 2000 B.C. The greatest pyramid, which lies nearest the modern
   road, was built by King Cheops or Khufu about 2800 B.C., and stands more
   than 450 feet in perpendicular height. In a line southwest from this are
   successively the Second Pyramid, built a generation later by King
   Khephren, and though slightly smaller, looking even larger because set on
   higher ground, and the radically smaller Third Pyramid of King Mycerinus,
   built about 2700 B.C. Near the edge of the plateau and due east of the
   Second Pyramid, with a face probably altered to form a colossal portrait
   of Khephren, its royal restorer, stands the monstrous Sphinx - mute,
   sardonic, and wise beyond mankind and memory.

   Minor pyramids and the traces of ruined minor pyramids are found in
   several places, and the whole plateau is pitted with the tombs of
   dignitaries of less than royal rank. These latter were originally marked
   by mastabas, or stone bench- like structures about the deep burial shafts,
   as found in other Memphian cemeteries and exemplified by Perneb's Tomb in
   the Metropolitan Museum of New York. At Gizeb, however, all such visible
   things have been swept away by time and pillage; and only the rock-hewn
   shafts, either sand-filled or cleared out by archaeologists, remain to
   attest their former existence. Connected with each tomb was a chapel in
   which priests and relatives offered food and prayer to the hovering ka or
   vital principle of the deceased. The small tombs have their chapels
   contained in their stone mastabas or superstructures, but the mortuary
   chapels of the pyramids, where regal Pharaohs lay, were separate temples,
   each to the east of its corresponding pyramid, and connec ted by a
   causeway to a massive gate-chapel or propylon at the edge of the rock
   plateau.

   The gate-chapel leading to the Second Pyramid, nearly buried in the
   drifting sands, yawns subterraneously south-east of the Sphinx. Persistent
   tradition dubs it the 'Temple of the Sphinx'; and it may perhaps be
   rightly called such if the Sphinx indeed represents the Second Pyramid's
   builder Khephren. There are unpleasant tales of the Sphinx before Khephren
   - but whatever its elder features were, the monarch replaced them with his
   own that men might look at the colossus without fear.

   It was in the great gateway-temple that the life-size diorite statue of
   Khephren now in the Cairo museum was found; a statue before which I stood
   in awe when I beheld it. Whether the whole edifice is now excavated I am
   not certain, but in 1910 most of it was below ground, with the entrance
   heavily barred at night. Germans were in charge of the work, and the war
   or other things may have stopped them. I would give much, in view of my
   experience and of certain Bedouin whisperings discredited or unknown in
   Cairo, to know what has developed in connection with a certain well in a
   transverse gallery where statues of the Pharaoh were found in curious
   juxtaposition to the statues of baboons.

   The road, as we traversed it on our camels that morning, curved sharply
   past the wooden police quarters, post office, drug store and shops on the
   left, and plunged south and east in a complete bend that scaled the rock
   plateau and brought us face to face with the desert under the lee of the
   Great Pyramid. Past Cyclopean masonry we rode, rounding the eastern face
   and looking down ahead into a valley of minor pyramids beyond which the
   eternal Nile glistened to the east, and the eternal desert shimmered to
   the west. Very close loomed the three major pyramids, the greatest devoid
   of outer casing and showing its bulk of great stones, but the others
   retaining here and there the neatly fitted covering which had made them
   smooth and finished in their day.

   Presently we descended toward the Sphinx, and sat silent beneath the spell
   of those terrible unseeing eyes. On the vast stone breast we faintly
   discerned the emblem of Re-Harakhte, for whose image the Sphinx was
   mistaken in a late dynasty; and though sand covered the tablet between the
   great paws, we recalled what Thutmosis IV inscribed thereon, and the dream
   he had when a prince. It was then that the smile of the Sphinx vaguely
   displeased us, and made us wonder about the legends of subterranean pas
   sages beneath the monstrous creature, leading down, down, to depths none
   might dare hint at - depths connected with mysteries older than the
   dynastic Egypt we excavate, and having a sinister relation to the
   persistence of abnormal, animal-headed gods in the ancient Nilotic
   pantheon. Then, too, it was I asked myself in idle question whose hideous
   significance was not to appear for many an hour.

   Other tourists now began to overtake us, and we moved on to the
   sand-choked Temple of the Sphinx, fifty yards to the southeast, which I
   have previously mentioned as the great gate of the causeway to the Second
   Pyramid's mortuary chapel on the plateau. Most of it was still
   underground, and although we dismounted and descended through a modern
   passageway to its alabaster corridor and pillared hall, I felt that Adul
   and the local German attendant had not shown us all there was to see.

   After this we made the conventional circuit of the pyramid plateau,
   examining the Second Pyramid and the peculiar ruins of its mortuary chapel
   to the east, the Third Pyramid and its miniature southern satellites and
   ruined eastern chapel, the rock tombs and the honeycombings of the Fourth
   and Fifth dynasties, and the famous Campbell's Tomb whose shadowy shaft
   sinks precipitously for fifty-three feet to a sinister sarcophagus which
   one of our camel drivers divested of the cumbering sand after a
   vertiginous descent by rope.

   Cries now assailed us from the Great Pyramid, where Bedouins were
   besieging a party of tourists with offers of speed in the performance of
   solitary trips up and down. Seven minutes is said to be the record for
   such an ascent and descent, but many lusty sheiks and sons of sheiks
   assured us they could cut it to five if given the requisite impetus of
   liberal baksheesh. They did not get this impetus, though we did let Abdul
   take us up, thus obtaining a view of unprecedented magnificence which
   included not only remote and glittering Cairo with its crowned citadel
   back ground of gold-violet hills, but all the pyramids of the Memphian
   district as well, from Abu Roash on the north to the Dashur on the south.
   The Sakkara step-pyramid, which marks the evolution of the low mastaba
   into the true pyramid, showed clearly and alluringly in the sandy
   distance. It is close to this transition-monument that the famed :omb of
   Perneb was found - more than four hundred miles orth of the Theban rock
   valley where Tut-Ankh-Amen sleeps. Again I was forced to silence through
   sheer awe. The prospect of such antiquity, and the secrets each hoary
   monument seemed to hold and brood over, filled me with a reverence and
   sense of immensity nothing else ever gave me.

   Fatigued by our climb, and disgusted with the importunate Bedouins whose
   actions seemed to defy every rule of taste, we omitted the arduous detail
   of entering the cramped interior passages of any of the pyramids, though
   we saw several of the hardiest tourists preparing for the suffocating
   crawl through Cheops' mightiest memorial. As we dismissed and overpaid our
   local bodyguard and drove back to Cairo with Abdul Reis under the
   afternoon sun, we half regretted the omission we had made. Such
   fascinating things were whispered about lower pyramid pas sages not in the
   guide books; passages whose entrances had been hastily blocked up and
   concealed by certain uncommunicative archaeologists who had found and
   begun to explore them.

   Of course, this whispering was largely baseless on the face of it; but it
   was curious to reflect how persistently visitors were forbidden to enter
   the Pyramids at night, or to visit the lowest burrows and crypt of the
   Great Pyramid. Perhaps in the latter case it was the psychological effect
   which was feared - the effect on the visitor of feeling himself huddled
   down beneath a gigantic world of solid masonry; joined to the life he has
   known by the merest tube, in which he may only crawl, and which any
   accident or evil design might block. The whole subject seemed so weird and
   alluring that we resolved to pay the pyramid plateau another visit at the
   earliest possible opportun ity. For me this opportunity came much earlier
   than I expected.

   That evening, the members of our party feeling some what tired after the
   strenuous program of the day, I went alone with Abdul Reis for a walk
   through the picturesque Arab quarter. Though I had seen it by day, I
   wished to study the alleys and bazaars in the dusk, when rich shadows and
   mellow gleams of light would add to their glamor and fantastic illusion.
   The native crowds were thinning, but were still very noisy and numerous
   when we came upon a knot of reveling Bedouins in the Suken-Nahhasin, or
   bazaar of the coppersmiths. Their apparent leader, an insolent youth with
   heavy features and saucily cocked tarbush, took some notice of us, and
   evidently recognized with no great friendliness my competent but
   admittedly supercilious and sneeringly disposed guide.

   Perhaps, I thought, he resented that odd reproduction of the Sphinx's
   half-smile which I had often remarked with amused irritation; or perhaps
   he did not like the hollow and sepulchral resonance of Abdul's voice. At
   any rate, the exchange of ancestrally opprobrious language became very
   brisk; and before long Ali Ziz, as I heard the stranger called when called
   by no worse name, began to pull violently at Abdul's robe, an action
   quickly reciprocated and leading to a spirited scuffle in which both
   combatants lost their sacredly cherished headgear and would have reached
   an even direr condition had I not intervened and separated them by main
   force.

   My interference, at first seemingly unwelcome on both sides, succeeded at
   last in effecting a truce. Sullenly each belligerent composed his wrath
   and his attire, and with an assumption of dignity as profound as it was
   sudden, the two formed a curious pact of honor which I soon learned is a
   custom of great antiquity in Cairo - a pact for the settle ment of their
   difference by means of a nocturnal fist atop the Great Pyramid, long after
   the departure of the last moon light sightseer. Each duelist was to
   assemble a party of seconds, and the affair was to begin at midnight,
   proceeding by rounds in the most civilized possible fashion.

   In all this planning there was much which excited my interest. The fight
   itself promised to be unique and spectacular, while the thought of the
   scene on that hoary pile overlooking the antediluvian plateau of Gizeh
   under the wan moon of the pallid small hours appealed to every fiber of
   imagination in me. A request found Abdul exceedingly willing to admit me
   to his party of seconds; so that all the rest of the early evening I
   accompanied him to various dens in the most lawless regions of the town -
   mostly northeast of the Ezbekiyeh - where he gathered one by one a select
   and formidable band of congenial cutthroats as his pugilistic background.

   Shortly after nine our party, mounted on donkeys bearing such royal or
   tourist-reminiscent names as 'Rameses,' 'Mark Twain,' 'J. P. Morgan,' and
   'Minnehaha', edged through street labyrinths both Oriental and Occidental,
   crossed the muddy and mast-forested Nile by the bridge of the bronze
   lions, and cantered philosophically between the lebbakhs on the road to
   Gizeh. Slightly over two hours were consumed by the trip, toward the end
   of which we passed the last of the returning tourists, saluted the last
   inbound trolley-car, and were alone with the night and the past and the
   spectral moon.

   Then we saw the vast pyramids at the end of the avenue, ghoulish with a
   dim atavistical menace which I had not seemed to notice in the daytime.
   Even the smallest of them held a hint of the ghastly -for was it not in
   this that they had buried Queen Nitocris alive in the Sixth Dynasty;
   subtle Queen Nitocris, who once invited all her enemies to a feast in a
   temple below the Nile, and drowned them by opening the water-gates? I
   recalled that the Arabs whisper things about Nitocris, and shun the Third
   Pyramid at certain phases of the moon. It must have been over her that
   Thomas Moore was brooding when he wrote a thing muttered about by Memphian
   boatmen: 'The subterranean nymph that dwells 
   'Mid sunless gems and glories hid - 
   The lady of the Pyramid!'

   Early as we were, Ali Ziz and his party were ahead of us; for we saw their
   donkeys outlined against the desert plateau at Kafrel-Haram; toward which
   squalid Arab settlement, close to the Sphinx, we had diverged instead of
   following the regular road to the Mena House, where some of the sleepy,
   inefficient police might have observed and halted us. Here, where filthy
   Bedouins stabled camels and donkeys in the rock tombs of Khephren's
   courtiers, we were led up the rocks and over the sand to the Great
   Pyramid, up whose time-worn sides the Arabs swarmed eagerly, Abdul Reis
   offering me the assistance I did not need.

   As most travelers know, the actual apex of this structure has long been
   worn away, leaving a reasonably flat platform twelve yards square. On this
   eery pinnacle a squared circle was formed, and in a few moments the
   sardonic desert moon leered down upon a battle which, but for the quality
   of the ringside cries, might well have occurred at some minor athletic
   club in America. As I watched it, I felt that some of our less -desirable
   institutions were not lacking; for every blow, feint, and defense bespoke
   'stalling' to my not inexperienced eye. It was quickly over, and despite
   my misgivings as to methods I felt a sort of proprietary pride when Abdul
   Reis was adjudged the winner.

   Reconciliation was phenomenally rapid, and amidst the singing,
   fraternizing and drinking that followed, I found it difficult to realize
   that a quarrel had ever occurred. Oddly enough, I myself seemed to be more
   a center of notice than the antagonists; and from my smattering of Arabic
   I judged that they were discussing my professional performances and
   escapes from every sort of manacle and confinement, in a manner which
   indicated not only a surprising knowledge of me, but a distinct hostility
   and skepticism concerning my feats of escape. It gradually dawned on me
   that the elder magic of Egypt did not depart without leaving traces, and
   that fragments of a strange secret lore and priestly cult practises have
   survived surreptitiously amongst the fella heen to such an extent that the
   prowess of a strange hahwi or magician is resented and disputed. I thought
   of how much my hollow-voiced guide Abdul Reis looked like an old Egyptian
   priest or Pharaoh or smiling Sphinx ... and wondered.

   Suddenly something happened which in a flash proved the correctness of my
   reflections and made me curse the denseness whereby I had accepted this
   night's events as other than the empty and malicious 'frame-up' they now
   showed themselves to be. Without warning, and doubtless in answer to some
   subtle sign from Abdul, the entire band of Bedouins precipitated itself
   upon me; and having produced heavy ropes, soon had me bound as securely as
   I was ever bound in the course of my life, either on the stage or off.

   I struggled at first, but soon saw that one man could make no headway
   against a band of over twenty sinewy barbarians. My hands were tied behind
   my back, my knees bent to their fullest extent, and my wrists and ankles
   stoutly linked together with unyielding cords. A stifling gag was forced
   into my mouth, and a blindfold fastened tightly over my eyes. Then, as
   Arabs bore me aloft on their shoulders and began a jouncing descent of the
   pyramid, I heard the taunts of my late guide Abdul, who mocked and jeered
   delightedly in his hollow voice, and assured me that I was soon to have my
   'magic-powers' put to a supreme test - which would quickly remove any
   egotism I might have gained through triumphing over all the tests offered
   by America and Europe. Egypt, he reminded me, is very old, and full of
   inner mysteries and antique powers not even conceivable to the experts of
   today, whose devices had so uniformly failed to entrap me.

   How far or in what direction I was carried, I cannot tell; for the
   circumstances were all against the formation of any accurate judgment. I
   know, however, that it could not have been a great distance; since my
   bearers at no point hastened beyond a walk, yet kept me aloft a
   surprisingly short time. It is this perplexing brevity which makes me feel
   almost like shuddering whenever I think of Gizeh and its plateau - for one
   is oppressed by hints of the closeness to everyday tourist routes of what
   existed then and must exist still.

   The evil abnormality I speak of did not become manifest at first. Setting
   me down on a surface which I recognized as sand rather than rock, my
   captors passed a rope around my chest and dragged me a few feet to a
   ragged opening in the ground, into which they presently lowered me with
   much rough handling. For apparent eons I bumped against the stony
   irregular sides of a narrow hewn well which I took to be one of the
   numerous burial-shafts of the plateau until the prodigious, almost
   incredible depth of it robbed me of all bases of conjecture.

   The horror of the experience deepened with every dragging second. That any
   descent through the sheer solid rock could be so vast without reaching the
   core of the planet itself, or that any rope made by man could be so long
   as to dangle me in these unholy and seemingly fathomless pro fundities of
   nether earth, were beliefs of such grotesqueness that it was easier to
   doubt my agitated senses than to accept them. Even now I am uncertain, for
   I know how deceitful the sense of time becomes when one is removed or
   distorted. But I am quite sure that I preserved a logical consciousness
   that far; that at least I did not add any fullgrown phantoms of
   imagination to a picture hideous enough in its reality, and explicable by
   a type of cerebral illusion vastly short of actual hallucination.

   All this was not the cause of my first bit of fainting. The shocking
   ordeal was cumulative, and the beginning of the later terrors was a very
   perceptible increase in my rate of descent. They were paying out that
   infinitely long rope very swiftly now, and I scraped cruelly against the
   rough and constricted sides of the shaft as I shot madly downward. My
   clothing was in tatters, and I felt the trickle of blood all over, even
   above the mounting and excruciating pain. My nostrils, too, were assailed
   by a scarcely definable menace: a creeping odor of damp and staleness
   curiously unlike anything I had ever smelled before, and having faint
   overtones of spice and incense that lent an element of mockery.

   Then the mental cataclysm came. It was horrible - hideous beyond all
   articulate description because it was all of the soul, with nothing of
   detail to describe. It was the ecstasy of nightmare and the summation of
   the fiendish. The suddenness of it was apocalyptic and demoniac - one
   moment I was plunging agonizingly down that narrow well of million-toothed
   torture, yet the next moment I was soaring on bat-wings in the gulfs of
   hell; swinging free and swooping through illimitable miles of boundless,
   musty space; rising dizzily to measureless pinnacles of chilling ether,
   then diving gaspingly to sucking nadirs of ravenous, nauseous lower vacua
   ... Thank God for the mercy that shut out in oblivion those clawing Furies
   of consciousness which half unhinged my faculties, and tore harpy-like at
   my spirit! That one respite, short as it was, gave me the strength and
   sanity to endure those still greater sublima tions of cosmic panic that
   lurked and gibbered on the road ahead.

                                       II

   It was very gradually that I regained my senses after that eldritch flight
   through stygian space. The process was infinitely painful, and colored by
   fantastic dreams in which my bound and gagged condition found singular
   embodiment. The precise nature of these dreams was very clear while I was
   experiencing them, but became blurred in my recollection almost
   immediately afterward, and was soon reduced to the merest outline by the
   terrible events - real or imaginary - which followed. I dreamed that I was
   in the grasp of a great and horrible paw; a yellow, hairy, five- clawed
   paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulf me. And when I
   stopped to reflect what the paw was, it seemed to me that it was Egypt. In
   the dream I looked back at the events of the preceding weeks, and saw
   myself lured and enmeshed little by little, subtly and insidiously, by
   some hellish ghoul-spirit of the elder Nile sorcery; some spirit that was
   in Egypt before ever man was, and that will be when man is no more.

   I saw the horror and unwholesome antiquity of Egypt, and the grisly
   alliance it has always had with the tombs and temples of the dead. I saw
   phantom processions of priests with the heads of bulls, falcons, cats, and
   ibises; phantom processions marching interminably through subterraneous
   labyrinths and avenues of titanic propylaea beside which a man is as a
   fly, and offering unnamable sacrifice to indescribable gods. Stone colossi
   marched in endless night and drove herds of grinning androsphinxes down to
   the shores of illimitable stagnant rivers of pitch. And behind it all I
   saw the ineffable malignity of primordial necromancy, black and amorphous,
   and fumbling greedily after me in the darkness to choke out the spirit
   that had dared to mock it by emulation.

   In my sleeping brain there took shape a melodrama of sinister hatred and
   pursuit, and I saw the black soul of Egypt singling me out and calling me
   in inaudible whispers; calling and luring me, leading me on with the
   glitter and glamor of a Saracenic surface, but ever pulling me down to the
   age-mad catacombs and horrors of its dead and abysmal pharaonic heart.

   Then the dream faces took on human resemblances, and I saw my guide Abdul
   Reis in the robes of a king, with the sneer of the Sphinx on his features.
   And I knew that those features were the features of Khephren the Great,
   who raised the Second Pyramid, carved over the Sphinx's face in the
   likeness of his own and built that titanic gateway temple whose myriad
   corridors the archaeologists think they have dug out of the cryptical sand
   and the uninformative rock. And I looked at the long, lean rigid hand of
   Khephren; the long, lean, rigid hand as I had seen it on the diorite
   statue in the Cairo Museum - the statue they had found in the terrible
   gateway temple - and wondered that I had not shrieked when I saw it on
   Abdul Reis... That hand! It was hideously cold, and it was crushing me; it
   was the cold and cramping of the sarcophagus . . . the chill and
   constriction of unrememberable Egypt... It was nighted, necropolitan Egypt
   itself.., that yellow paw. .. and they whisper such things of Khephren...

   But at this juncture I began to wake - or at least, to assume a condition
   less completely that of sleep than the one just preceding. I recalled the
   fight atop the pyramid, the treacherous Bedouins and their attack, my
   frightful descent by rope through endless rock depths, and my mad swinging
   and plunging in a chill void redolent of aromatic putrescence. I perceived
   that I now lay on a damp rock floor, and that my bonds were still biting
   into me with unloosened force. It was very cold, and I seemed to detect a
   faint current of noisome air sweeping across me. The cuts and bruises I
   had received from the jagged sides of the rock shaft were paining me
   woefully, their soreness enhanced to a stinging or burning acuteness by
   some pungent quality in the faint draft, and the mere act of rolling over
   was enough to set my whole frame throbbing with untold agony.

   As I turned I felt a tug from above, and concluded that the rope whereby I
   was lowered still reached to the surface. Whether or not the Arabs still
   held it, I had no idea; nor had I any idea how far within the earth I was.
   I knew that the darkness around me was wholly or nearly total, since no
   ray of moonlight penetrated my blindfold; but I did not trust my senses
   enough to accept as evidence of extreme depth the sensation of vast
   duration which had characterized my descent.

   Knowing at least that I was in a space of considerable extent reached from
   the above surface directly by an opening in the rock, I doubtfully
   conjectured that my prison was perhaps the buried gateway chapel of old
   Khephren - the Temple of the Sphinx - perhaps some inner corridors which
   the guides had not shown me during my morning visit, and from which I
   might easily escape if I could find my way to the barred entrance. It
   would be a labyrinthine wandering, but no worse than others out of which I
   had in the past found my way.

   The first step was to get free of my bonds, gag, and blindfold; and this I
   knew would be no great task, since subtler experts than these Arabs had
   tried every known species of fetter upon me during my long and varied
   career as an exponent of escape, yet had never succeeded in defeating my
   methods.

   Then it occurred to me that the Arabs might be ready to meet and attack me
   at the entrance upon any evidence of my probable escape from the binding
   cords, as would be furnished by any decided agitation of the rope which
   they probably held. This, of course, was taking for granted that my place
   of confinement was indeed Khephren's Temple of the Sphinx. The direct
   opening in the roof, wherever it might lurk, could not be beyond easy
   reach of the ordinary modern entrance near the Sphinx; if in truth it were
   any great distance at all on the surface, since the total area known to
   visitors is not at all enormous. I had not noticed any such opening during
   my daytime pilgrimage, but knew that these things are easily overlooked
   amidst the drifting sands.

   Thinking these matters over as I lay bent and bound on the rock floor, I
   nearly forgot the horrors of abysmal descent and cavernous swinging which
   had so lately reduced me to a coma. My present thought was only to outwit
   the Arabs, and I accordingly determined to work myself free as quickly as
   possible, avoiding any tug on the descending line which might betray an
   effective or even problematical attempt at freedom.

   This, however, was more easily determined than effected. A few preliminary
   trials made it clear that little could be accomplished without
   considerable motion; and it did not surprise me when, after one especially
   energetic struggle, I began to feel the coils of falling rope as they
   piled up about me and upon me. Obviously, I thought, the Bedouins had felt
   my movements and released their end of the rope; hastening no doubt to the
   temple's true entrance to lie murderously in wait for me.

   The prospect was not pleasing - but I had faced worse in my time without
   flinching, and would not flinch now. At present I must first of all free
   myself of bonds, then trust to ingenuity to escape from the temple
   unharmed. It is curious how implicitly I had come to believe myself in the
   old temple of Khephren beside the Sphinx, only a short dis tance below the
   ground.

   That belief was shattered, and every pristine apprehen sion of
   preternattiral depth and demoniac mystery revived, by a circumstance which
   grew in horror and significance even as I formulated my philosophical
   plan. I have said that the falling rope was piling up about and upon me.
   Now I saw that it was continuing to pile, as no rope of normal length
   could possibly do. It gained in momentum and became an avalanche of hemp,
   accumulating moun tainously on the floor and half burying me beneath its
   swiftly multiplying coils. Soon I was completely engulfed and gasping for
   breath as the increasing convolutions submerged and stifled me.

   My senses tottered again, and I vaguely tried to fight off a menace
   desperate and ineluctable. It was not merely that I was tortured beyond
   human endurance - not merely that life and breath seemed to be crushed
   slowly out of me - it was the knowledge of what those unnatural lengths of
   rope implied, and the consciousness of what unknown and incalculable gulfs
   of inner earth must at this moment be surrounding me. My endless descent
   and swinging flight through goblin space, then, must have been real, and
   even now I must be lying helpless in some nameless cavern world toward the
   core of the planet. Such a sudden confirmation of ultimate horror was
   insupportable, and a second time I lapsed into merciful oblivion.

   When I say oblivion, I do not imply that I was free from dreams. On the
   contrary, my absence from the conscious world was marked by visions of the
   most unutterable hideousness. God! ... If only I had not read so much
   Egyptology before coming to this land which is the fountain of all
   darkness and terror! This second spell of fainting filled my sleeping mind
   anew with shivering realization of the country and its archaic secrets,
   and through some damnable chance my dreams turned to the ancient notions
   of the dead and their sojournings in soul and body beyond those mysterious
   tombs which were more houses than graves. I recalled, in dream-shapes
   which it is well that I do not remember, the peculiar and elaborate
   construction of Egyptian sepulchers; and the exceedingly singular and
   terrific doctrines which determined this construction.

   All these people thought of was death and the dead. They conceived of a
   literal resurrection of the body which made them mummify it with desperate
   care, and preserve all the vital organs in canopic jars near the corpse;
   whilst besides the body they believed in two other elements, the soul,
   which after its weighing and approval by Osiris dwelt in the land of the
   blest, and the obscure and portentous ka or life-principle which wandered
   about the upper and lower worlds in a horrible way, demanding occasional
   access to the preserved body, consuming the food offerings brought by
   priests and pious relatives to the mortuary chapel, and sometimes - as men
   whispered - taking its body or the wooden double always buried beside it
   and stalking noxiously abroad on errands peculiarly repellent.

   For thousands of years those bodies rested gorgeously encased and staring
   glassily upward when not visited by the ka, awaiting the day when Osiris
   should restore both ka and soul, and lead forth the stiff legions of the
   dead from the sunken houses of sleep. It was to have been a glorious
   rebirth - but not all souls were approved, nor were all tombs inviolate,
   so that certain grotesque mistakes and fiendish abnormalities were to be
   looked for. Even today the Arabs murmur of unsanctified convocations and
   unwholesome worship in forgotten nether abysses, which only winged
   invisible kas and soulless mummies may visit and return unscathed.

   Perhaps the most leeringly blood-congealing legends are those which relate
   to certain perverse products of decadent priestcraft - composite mummies
   made by the artificial union of human trunks and limbs with the heads of
   animals in imitation of the elder gods. At all stages of history the
   sacred animals were mummified, so that consecrated bulls, cats, ibises,
   crocodiles and the like might return some day to greater glory. But only
   in the decadence did they mix the human and the animal in the same mummy -
   only in the decadence, when they did not understand the rights and
   prerogatives of the ka and the soul.

   What happened to those composite mummies is not told of- at least publicly
   - and it is certain that no Egyptologist ever found one. The whispers of
   Arabs are very wild, and cannot be relied upon. They even hint that old
   Khephren - he of the Sphinx, the Second Pyramid and the yawning gateway
   temple - lives far underground wedded to the ghoul-queen Nitocris and
   ruling over the mummies that are neither of man nor of beast.

   It was of these - of Khephren and his consort and his strange armies of
   the hybrid dead - that I dreamed, and that is why I am glad the exact
   dream-shapes have faded from my memory. My most horrible vision was
   connected with an idle question I had asked myself the day before when
   looking at the great carven riddle of the desert and wondering with what
   unknown depth the temple close to it might be secretly connected. That
   question, so innocent and whimsical then, assumed in my dream a meaning of
   frenetic and hysterical madness ... what huge and loathsome abnormality
   was the Sphinx originally carven to represent?

   My second awakening - if awakening it was - is a memory of stark
   hideousness which nothing else in my life - save one thing which came
   after - can parallel; and that life has been full and adventurous beyond
   most men's. Remember that I had lost consciousness whilst buried beneath a
   cascade of falling rope whose immensity revealed the cataclysmic depth of
   my present position. Now, as perception returned, I felt the entire weight
   gone; and realized upon rolling over that although I was still tied,
   gagged and blindfolded, some agency had removed completely the suffocating
   hempen landslide which had overwhelmed me. The significance of this
   condition, of course, came to me only gradually; but even so I think it
   would have brought unconsciousness again had I not by this time reached
   such a state of emotional exhaustion that no new horror could make much
   difference. I was alone... with what?

   Before I could torture myself with any new reflection, or make any fresh
   effort to escape from my bonds, an additional circumstance became
   manifest. Pains not formerly felt were racking my arms and legs, and I
   seemed coated with a profusion of dried blood beyond anything my former
   cuts and abrasions could furnish. My chest, too, seemed pierced by a
   hundred wounds, as though some malign, titanic ibis had been pecking at
   it. Assuredly the agency which had removed the rope was a hostile one, and
   had begun to wreak terrible injuries upon me when somehow impelled to
   desist. Yet at the same time my sensations were distinctly the reverse of
   what one might expect. Instead of sinking into a bottomless pit of
   despair, I was stirred to a new courage and action; for now I felt that
   the evil forces were physical things which a fearless man might encounter
   on an even basis.

   On the strength of this thought I tugged again at my bonds, and used all
   the art of a lifetime to free myself as I had so often done amidst the
   glare of lights and the applause of vast crowds. The familiar details of
   my escaping process commenced to engross me, and now that the long rope
   was gone I half regained my belief that the supreme horrors were
   hallucinations after all, and that there had never been any terrible
   shaft, measureless abyss or interminable rope. Was I after all in the
   gateway temple of Khephren beside the Sphinx, and had the sneaking Arabs
   stolen in to torture me as I lay helpless there? At any rate, I must be
   free. Let me stand up unbound, ungagged, and with eyes open to catch any
   glimmer of light which might come trickling from any source, and I could
   actually delight in the combat against evil and treacherous foes!

   How long I took in shaking off my encumbrances I cannot tell. It must have
   been longer than in my exhibition performances, because I was wounded,
   exhausted, and enervated by the experiences I had passed through. When I
   was finally free, and taking deep breaths of a chill, damp, evilly spiced
   air all the more horrible when encountered without the screen of gag and
   blindfold edges, I found that I was too cramped and fatigued to move at
   once. There I lay, trying to stretch a frame bent and mangled, for an
   indefinite period, and straining my eyes to catch a glimpse of some ray of
   light which would give a hint as to my position.

   By degrees my strength and flexibility returned, but my eyes beheld
   nothing. As I staggered to my feet I peered diligently in every direction,
   yet met only an ebony blackness as great as that I had known when
   blindfolded. I tried my legs, blood-encrusted beneath my shredded
   trousers, and found that I could walk; yet could not decide in what
   direction to go. Obviously I ought not to walk at random, and perhaps
   retreat directly from the entrance I sought; so I paused to note the
   difference of the cold, fetid, natron-scented air-current which I had
   never ceased to feel. Accepting the point of its source as the possible
   entrance to the abyss, I strove to keep track of this landmark and to walk
   consistently toward it.

   I had a match-box with me, and even a small electric flashlight; but of
   course the pockets of my tossed and tattered clothing were long since
   emptied of all heavy articles. As I walked cautiously in the blackness,
   the draft grew stronger and more offensive, till at length I could regard
   it as nothing less than a tangible stream of detestable vapor pouring out
   of some aperture like the smoke of the genie from the fisherman's jar in
   the Eastern tale. The East ... Egypt ... truly, this dark cradle of
   civilization was ever the wellspring of horrors and marvels unspeakable!

   The more I reflected on the nature of this cavern wind, the greater my
   sense of disquiet became; for although despite its odor I had sought its
   source as at least an indirect clue to the outer world, I now saw plainly
   that this foul emanation could have no admixture or connection whatsoever
   with the clean air of the Libyan Desert, but must be essentially a thing
   vomited from sinister gulfs still lower down. I had, then, been walking in
   the wrong direction!

   After a moment's reflection I decided not to retrace my steps. Away from
   the draft I would have no landmarks, for the roughly level rock floor was
   devoid of distinctive configurations. If, however, I followed up the
   strange current, I would undoubtedly arrive at an aperture of some sort,
   from whose gate I could perhaps work round the walls to the opposite side
   of this Cyclopean and otherwise unnavigable hall. That I might fail, I
   well realized. I saw that this was no part of Khephren's gateway temple
   which tourists know, and it struck me that this particular hall might be
   unknown even to archaeologists, and merely stumbled upon by the
   inquisitive and malignant Arabs who had imprisoned me. If so, was there
   any present gate of escape to the known parts or to the outer air?

   What evidence, indeed, did I now possess that this was the gateway temple
   at all? For a moment all my wildest speculations rushed back upon me, 'and
   I thought of that vivid melange of impressions - descent, suspension in
   space, the rope, my wounds, and the dreams that were frankly dreams. Was
   this the end of life for me? Or indeed, would it be merciful if this
   moment were the end? I could answer none of my own questions, but merely
   kept on, till Fate for a third time reduced me to oblivion.

   This time there were no dreams, for the suddenness of the incident shocked
   me out of all thought either conscious or subconscious. Tripping on an
   unexpected descending step at a point where the offensive draft became
   strong enough to offer an actual physical resistance, I was precipitated
   headlong down a black flight of huge stone stairs into a gulf of
   hideousness unrelieved.

   That I ever breathed again is a tribute to the inherent vitality of the
   healthy human organism. Often I look back to that night and feel a touch
   of actual humor in those repeated lapses of consciousness; lapses whose
   succession reminded me at the time of nothing more than the crude cinema
   melodramas of that period. Of course, it is possible that the repeated
   lapses never occurred; and that all the features of that underground
   nightmare were merely the dreams of one long coma which began with the
   shock of my descent into that abyss and ended with the healing balm of the
   outer air and of the rising sun which found me stretched on the sands of
   Gizeh before the sardonic and dawn-flushed face of the Great Sphinx.

   I prefer to believe this latter explanation as much as I can, hence was
   glad when the police told me that the barrier to Krephren's gateway temple
   had been found unfastened, and that a sizeable rift to the surface did
   actually exist in one corner of the still buried part. I was glad, too,
   when the doctors pronounced my wounds only those to be expected from my
   seizure, blindfolding, lowering, struggling with bonds, falling some
   distance - perhaps into a depression in the temple's inner gallery -
   dragging myself to the outer barrier and escaping from it, and experiences
   like that.., a very soothing diagnosis. And yet I know that there must be
   more than appears on the surface. That extreme descent is too vivid a
   memory to be dismissed - and it is odd that no one has ever been able to
   find a man answering the description of my guide, Abdul Reis el Drogman-
   the tomb-throated guide who looked and smiled like King Khephren.

   I have digressed from my connected narrative - perhaps in the vain hope of
   evading the telling of that final incident; that incident which of all is
   most certainly an hallucination. But I promised to relate it, and I do not
   break promises. When I recovered - or seemed to recover - my senses after
   that fall down the black stone stairs, I was quite as alone and in
   darkness as before. The windy stench, bad enough before, was now fiendish;
   yet I had acquired enough familiarity by this time to bear it stoically.
   Dazedly I began to crawl away from the place whence the putrid wind came,
   and with my bleeding hands felt the colossal blocks of a mighty pavement.
   Once my head struck against a hard object, and when I felt of it I learned
   that it was the base of a column - a column of unbelievable immensity -
   whose surface was covered with gigantic chiseled hieroglyphics very
   perceptible to my touch.

   Crawling on, I encountered other titan columns at incomprehensible
   distances apart; when suddenly my attention was captured by the
   realization of something which must have been impinging on my subconscious
   hearing long before the conscious sense was aware of it.

   From some still lower chasm in earth's bowels were proceeding certain
   sounds, measured and definite, and like nothing I had ever heard before.
   That they were very ancient and distinctly ceremonial I felt almost
   intuitively; and much reading in Egyptology led me to associate them with
   the flute, the sambuke, the sistrum, and the tympa num. In their rhythmic
   piping, droning, rattling and beat ing I felt an element of terror beyond
   all the known terrors of earth - a terror peculiarly dissociated from
   personal fear, and taking the form of a sort of objective pity for our
   planet, that it should hold within its depths such horrors as must lie
   beyond these aegipanic cacophonies. The sounds increased in volume, and I
   felt that they were approaching. Then - and may all the gods of all
   pantheons unite to keep the like from my ears again - I began to hear,
   faintly and afar off, the morbid and millennial tramping of the marching
   things.

   It was hideous that footfalls so dissimilar should move in such perfect
   rhythm. The training of unhallowed thousands of years must lie behind that
   march of earth's inmost monstrosities ... padding, clicking, walking,
   stalking, rumbling, lumbering, crawling.. . and all to the abhorrent
   discords of those mocking instruments. And then - God keep the memory of
   those Arab legends out of my head! - the mummies without souls ... the
   meeting-place of the wandering ..... the hordes of the devil-cursed
   pharaonic dead of forty centuries.. . the composite mummies led through
   the uttermost onyx voids by King Khephren and his ghoul-queen Nitocris ...

   The tramping drew nearer - Heaven save me from the sound of those feet and
   paws and hooves and pads and talons as it commenced to acquire detail!
   Down limitless reaches of sunless pavement a spark of light flickered in
   the malodorous wind and I drew behind the enormous circumference of a
   Cyclopic column that I might escape for a while the horror that was
   stalking million-footed toward me through gigantic hypostyles of inhuman
   dread and phobic antiquity. The flickers increased, and the tramping and
   dissonant rhythm grew sickeningly loud. In the quivering orange light
   there stood faintly forth a scene of such stony awe that I gasped from
   sheer wonder that conquered even fear and repulsion. Bases of columns
   whose middles were higher than human sight. . . mere bases of things that
   must each dwarf the Eiffel Tower to insignificance ... hieroglyphics
   carved by unthinkable hands in caverns where daylight can be only a remote
   legend...

   I would not look at the marching things. That I desperately resolved as I
   heard their creaking joints and nitrous wheezing above the dead music and
   the dead tramping. It was merciful that they did not speak... but God!
   their crazy torches began to cast shadows on the surface of those
   stupendous columns. Hippopotami should not have human hands and carzy
   torches... men should not have the heads of crocodiles...

   I tried to turn away, but the shadows and the sounds and the stench were
   everywhere. Then I remembered something I used to do in half-conscious
   nightmares as a boy, and began to repeat to myself, 'This is a dream! This
   is a dream!' But it was of no use, and I could only shut my eyes and pray
   ... at least, that is what I think I did, for one is never sure in visions
   - and I know this can have been nothing more. I wondered whether I should
   ever reach the world again, and at times would furtively open my eyes to
   see if I could discern any feature of the place other than the wind of
   spiced putrefaction, the topless columns, and the thaumatropically
   grotesque shadows of abnormal horror. The sputtering glare of multiplying
   torches now shone, and unless this hellish place were wholly without
   walls, I could not fail to see some boundary or fixed landmark soon. But I
   had to shut my eyes again when I realized how many of the things were
   assembling - and when I glimpsed a certain object walking solemnly and
   steadily without any body above the waist.

   A fiendish and ululant corpse-gurgle or death-rattle now split the very
   atmosphere - the charnel atmosphere poisonous with naftha and bitumen
   blasts - in one concerted chorus from the ghoulish legion of hybrid
   blasphemies. My eyes, perversely shaken open, gazed for an instant upon a
   sight which no human creature could even imagine without panic, fear and
   physical exhaustion. The things had filed ceremonially in one direction,
   the direction of the noisome wind, where the light of their torches showed
   their bended heads - or the bended heads of such as had heads. They were
   worshipping before a great black fetor-belching aperture which reached up
   almost out of sight, -and which I could see was flanked at right angles by
   two giant staircases whose ends were far away in shadow. One of these was
   indubitably the staircase I had fallen down.

   The dimensions of the hole were fully in proportion with those of the
   columns - an ordinary house would have been lost in it, and any average
   public building could easily have been moved in and out. It was so vast a
   surface that only by moving the eye could one trace its boundaries.. . so
   vast, so hideously black, and so aromatically stinking . .. Directly in
   front of this yawning Polyphemus-door the things were throwing objects -
   evidently sacrifices or religious offerings, to judge by their gestures.
   Khephren was their leader; sneering King Khephren or the guide Abdul Reis,
   crowned with a golden pshent and intoning endless formulae with the hollow
   voice of the dead. By his side knelt beautiful Queen Nitocris, whom I saw
   in profile for a moment, noting that the right half of her face was eaten
   away by rats or other ghouls. And I shut my eyes again when I saw what
   objects were being thrown as offerings to the fetid aperture or its
   possible local deity.

   It occurred to me that, judging from the elaborateness of this worship,
   the concealed deity must be one of considerable importance. Was it Osiris
   or Isis, Horus or Anubis, or some vast unknown God of the Dead still more
   central and supreme? There is a legend that terrible altars and colossi
   were reared to an Unknown One before ever the known gods were
   worshipped...

   And now, as I steeled myself to watch the rapt and sepulchral adorations
   of those nameless things, a thought of escape flashed upon me. The hall
   was dim, and the columns heavy with shadow. With every creature of that
   nightmare throng absorbed in shocking raptures, it might be barely
   possible for me to creep past to the far-away end of one of the staircases
   and ascend unseen; trusting to Fate and skill to deliver me from the upper
   reaches. Where I was, I neither knew nor seriously reflected upon - and
   for a

   moment it struck me as amusing to plan a serious escape from that which I
   knew to be a dream. Was I in some hidden and unsuspected lower realm of
   Khephren's gateway temple - that temple which generations have persis
   tently called the Temple of the Sphinx? I could not conjecture, but I
   resolved to ascend to life and consciousness if wit and muscle could carry
   me.

   Wriggling flat on my stomach, I began the anxious journey toward the foot
   of the left-hand staircase, which seemed the more accessible of the two. I
   cannot describe the incidents and sensations of that crawl, but they may
   be guessed when one reflects on what I had to watch steadily in that
   malign, wind-blown torchlight in order to avoid detection. The bottom of
   the staircase was, as I have said, far away in shadow, as it had to be to
   rise without a bend to the dizzy parapeted landing above the titanic
   aperture. This placed the last stages of my crawl at some distance from
   the noisome herd, though the spectacle chilled me even when quite remote
   at my right.

   At length I succeeded in reaching the steps and began to climb; keeping
   close to the wall, on which I observed decorations of the most hideous
   sort, and relying for safety on the absorbed, ecstatic interest with which
   the monstrosities watched the foul-breezed aperture and the impious
   objects of nourishment they had flung on the pavement before it. Though
   the staircase was huge and steep, fashioned of vast porphyry blocks as if
   for the feet of a giant, the ascent seemed virtually interminable. Dread
   of discovery and the pain which renewed exercise had brought to my wounds
   combined to make that upward crawl a thing of agonizing memory. I had
   intended, on reaching the landing, to climb immediately onward along
   whatever upper staircase might mount from there; stopping for no last look
   at the carrion abominations that pawed and genuflected some seventy or
   eighty feet below - yet a sudden repetition of that thunderous
   corpse-gurgle and death-rattle chorus, coming as I had nearly gained the
   top of the flight and showing by its ceremonial rhythm that it was not an
   alarm of my discovery, caused me to pause and peer cautiously over the
   parapet.

   The monstrosities were hailing something which had poked itself out of the
   nauseous aperture to seize the hellish fare proffered it. It was something
   quite ponderous, even as seen from my height; something yellowish and
   hairy, and endowed with a sort of nervous motion. It was as large,
   perhaps, as a good-sized hippopotamus, but very curiously shaped. It
   seemed to have no neck, but five separate shaggy heads springing in a row
   from a roughly cylindrical trunk; the first very small, the second
   good-sized, the third and fourth equal and largest of all, and the fifth
   rather small, though not so small as the first.

   Out of these heads darted curious rigid tentacles which seized ravenously
   on the excessively great quantities of unmentionable food placed before
   the aperture. Once in a while the thing would leap up, and occasionally it
   would retreat into its den in a very odd manner. Its locomotion was so
   inexplicable that I stared in fascination, wishing it would emerge farther
   from the cavernous lair beneath me.

   Then it did emerge ... it did emerge, and at the sight I turned and fled
   into the darkness up the higher staircase that rose behind me; fled
   unknowingly up incredible steps and ladders and inclined planes to which
   no human sight or logic guided me, and which I must ever relegate to the
   world of dreams for want of any confirmation. It must have been a dream,
   or the dawn would never have found me breathing on the sands of Gizeh
   before the sardonic dawn-flushed face of the Great Sphinx.

   The Great Sphinx! God! - that idle question I asked myself on that
   sun-blest morning before ... what huge and loathsome abnormality was the
   Sphinx originally carven to represent?

   Accursed is the sight, be it in dream or not, that revealed to me the
   supreme horror - the unknown God of the Dead, which licks its colossal
   chops in the unsuspected abyss, fed hideous morsels by soulless
   absurdities that should not exist. The five-headed monster that emerged
   ... that five-headed monster as large as a hippopotamus ... the five
   headed monster - and that of which it is the merest forepaw...

   But I survived, and I know it was only a dream.

   In a letter to Frank Belknap Long dated February 14, 1924, HPL wrote:

     It seems that once Houdini was in Cairo with his wife on a
     non-professional pleasure trip, when his Arab guide became involved in a
     street fight with another Arab. In accordance with custom, the natives
     decided to fight it out that night on the top of the Great Pyramid; and
     Houdini's guide, knowing the magician's interest in exotic oddities,
     invited him to go along with his party of seconds and supporters.
     Houdini did, and saw a tame fistic encounter followed by an equally
     mechanical reconciliation. There was something off-colour and rehearsed
     about it all, and the wizard was hardly surprised when suddenly the
     frame-up was revealed, and he found himself bound and gagged by the two
     Arabs who had faked the combat. It had all been prearranged--the natives
     had heard of him as a mighty wizard of the West, and were determined to
     test his powers in a land where wizards had once ruled supreme. Without
     ceremony they took him to an aperture in the roof of the Temple of the
     Pharaoh's (Campbell's Tomb) where a sheer drop of fifty-three feet
     brings one to the floor of the nighted crypt which has but one normal
     entrance--a winding passage very far from this well-like opening.
     Producing a long rope, they lowered him into this abode of darkness and
     death and left him there without means of ascent--bound and gagged
     amidst the kingly dead, and ignorant of how to find the real exit. Hours
     later he staggered out of that real exit, free, yet shaken to the core
     with some hideous experience about which he hesitates to talk. It will
     be my job to invent the incident, and give it my most macabre touches.
     As yet, I don't know how far I can go, since from a specimen Houdini
     story which Henneberger sent me I judge that the magician tries to pass
     off these Munchausens as real adventures. He's extremely egotistical, as
     one can see at a glance. But in any case, I guess I can weave in some
     pretty shocking things ... unsuspected lower caverns, a burning light
     amidst the balsam'd dead, or a terrible fate for the Arab guides who
     sought to frighten Our Hero.
