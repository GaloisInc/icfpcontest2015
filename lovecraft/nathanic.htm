				<p>It was in the pale garden of Zais;
				<br>The mist-shrouded gardens of Zais,
				<br>Where blossoms the white naphalot,
				<br>The redolent herald of midnight.
				<br>There slumber the still lakes of crystal,
				<br>And streamlets that flow without murm'ring;
				<br>Smooth streamlets from caverns of Kathos
				<br>Where broodth the calm spirits of twilight.
				<br>And over the lakes and the streamlets
				<br>Are bridges of pure alabaster,
				<br>White bridges all cunningly carven
				<br>With figures of fairies and daemons.
				<br>Here glimmer strange suns and strange planets,
				<br>And strange is the crescent Bnapis
				<br>That sets 'yong the ivy-grown ramparts
				<br>Where thicken the dusk of the evening.
				<br>Here fall the white vapours of Yabon;
				<br>And here in the swirl of vapours
				<br>I saw the divine Nathicana;
				<br>The garlanded, white Nathicana;
				<br>The slow-eyed, red-lipped Nathicana;
				<br>The silver-voiced, sweet Nathicana;
				<br>The pale-rob'd, belov'd Nathicana.
				<br>And ever was she my beloved,
				<br>From ages when time was unfashioned
				<br>Now anything fashion'd but Yabon.
				<br>And here dwelt we ever and ever,
				<br>The innocent children of Zais,
				<br>At peace in the paths and the arbours,
				<br>White-crowned with the blest nephalote.
				<br>How oft would we float in the twilight
				<br>O'er flow'r-cover'd pastures and hillsides
				<br>All white with the lowly astalthon;
				<br>The lowly yet lovely astalthon,
				<br>And dream in a world made of dreaming
				<br>The dreams that are fairer than Aidenn;
				<br>Bright dreams that are truer than reason!
				<br>So dreamed and so lov'd we thro' ages,
				<br>Till came the cursed season of Dzannin;
				<br>The daemon-damn'd season of Dzannin;
				<br>When red shone the suns and the planets,
				<br>And red leamed the crescent Banapis,
				<br>And red fell the vapours of Yabon.
				<br>Then redden'd the blossoms and streamlets
				<br>And lakes that lay under the bridges,
				<br>And even the calm alabaster
				<br>glowed pink with uncanny reflections
				<br>Till all the carv'd fairies and daemons
				<br>Leer'd redly from the backgrounds of shadow.
				<br>Now redden'd my vision, and madly
				<br>I strove to peer thro' the dense curtain
				<br>And glimpsed the divine Nathicana;
				<br>The pure, ever-pale Nathicana;
				<br>The lov'd, the unchang'd Nathicana.
				<br>But vortex on vortex of madness
				<br>Beclouded my labouring vision;
				<br>My damnable, reddening vision
				<br>That built a new world for my seeing;
				<br>Anew world of redness and darkness,
				<br>A horrible coma call'd living
				<br>So now in this come call'd living
				<br>I view the bright phantons of beauty;
				<br>The false hollow phantoms of beauty
				<br>That cloak all the evils of Dzannin.
				<br>I view them with infinite longing,
				<br>So like do they seem to my lov'd one:
				<br>Yet foul for their eyes shines their evil;
				<br>Their cruel and pitilessevil,
				<br>More evil than Thaphron and Latgoz,
				<br>Twice ill fro its gorgeous concealment.
				<br>And only in slumbers of midnight
				<br>Appears the lost maid Nathicana,
				<br>The pallid, the pure Nathicana
				<br>Who fades at the glance of the dreamer.
				<br>Again and again do I seek her;
				<br>I woo with deep draughts of Plathotis,
				<br>Deep draughts brew'd in wine of Astarte
				<br>And strengthen'd with tears of long weeping.
				<br>I yearn for the gardens of Zais;
				<br>The lovely, lost garden of Zais
				<br>Where blossoms the white nephalot,
				<br>The redolent herald of midnight.
				<br>The last potent draught am I brewing;
				<br>A draught that the daemons delight ih;
				<br>A drught that will banish the redness;
				<br>The horrible coma call'd living.
				<br>Soon, soon, if I fail not in brewing,
				<br>The redness and madness will vanish,
				<br>And deep in the worm-people'd darkness
				<br>Will rot the base chains that hav bound me.
				<br>Once more shall the gardens of Zais
				<br>Dawn white on my long-tortur'd vision,
				<br>Andthere midst the vapours of Yabon
				<br>Will stand the divine Nathicana;
				<br>The deathless, restor'd Nathicana
				<br>whose like is not met with in living.

<hr>
<p>In a letter to Donald Wandrei written August 2, 1927, Lovecraft said that this poem was supposed to be a "parody on those stylistic excesses which really have no basic meaning".  In his response ten days later, Wandrei said "It is a rare and curious kind of literary freak, a satire too good, so that, instead of parodying, it possesses, the original."
