   I saw him on a sleepless night when I was walking desperately to save my
   soul and my vision. My coming to New York had been a mistake; for whereas
   I had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming labyrinths
   of ancient streets that twist endlessly from forgotten courts and squares
   and waterfronts to courts and squares and waterfronts equally forgotten,
   and in the Cyclopean modern towers and pinnacles that rise blackly
   Babylonian under waning moons, I had found instead only a sense of horror
   and oppression which threatened to master, paralyze, and annihilate me.

   The disillusion had been gradual. Coming for the first time upon the town,
   I had seen it in the sunset from a bridge, majestic above its waters, its
   incredible peaks and pyramids rising flowerlike and delicate from pools of
   violet mist to play with the flaming clouds and the first stars of
   evening. Then it had lighted up window by window above the shimmering
   tides where lanterns nodded and glided and deep horns bayed weird
   harmonies, and had itself become a starry firmament of dream, redolent of
   faery music, and one with the marvels of Carcassonne and Samarcand and El
   Dorado and all glorious and half-fabulous cities. Shortly afterward I was
   taken through those antique ways so dear to my fancy-narrow, curving
   alleys and passages where rows of red Georgian brick blinked with
   small-paned dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded
   sedans and paneled coaches - and in the first flush of realization of
   these long-wished things I thought I had indeed achieved such treasures as
   would make me in time a poet.

   But success and happiness were not to be. Garish daylight showed only
   squalor and alienage and the noxious elephantiasis of climbing, spreading
   stone where the moon had hinted of loveliness and elder magic; and the
   throngs of people that seethed through the flume-like streets were squat,
   swarthy strangers with hardened faces and narrow eyes, shrewd strangers
   without dreams and without kinship to the scenes about them, who could
   never mean aught to a blue-eyed man of the old folk, with the love of fair
   green lanes and white New England village steeples in his heart.

   So instead of the poems I had hoped for, there came only a shuddering
   blackness and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at last a fearful truth
   which no one had ever dared to breathe before - the unwhisperable secret
   of secrets - the fact that this city of stone and stridor is not a
   sentient perpetuation of Old New York as London is of Old London and Paris
   of Old Paris, but that it is in fact quite dead, its sprawling body
   imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which have
   nothing to do with it as it was in life. Upon making this discovery I
   ceased to sleep comfortably; though something of resigned tranquillity
   came back as I gradually formed the habit of keeping off the streets by
   day and venturing abroad only at night, when darkness calls forth what
   little of the past still hovers wraith-like about, and old white doorways
   remember the stalwart forms that once passed through them. With this mode
   of relief I even wrote a few poems, and still refrained from going home to
   my people lest I seem to crawl back ignobly in defeat.

   Then, on a sleepless night's walk, I met the man. It was in a grotesque
   hidden courtyard of the Greenwich section, for there in my ignorance I had
   settled, having heard of the place as the natural home of poets and
   artists. The archaic lanes and houses and unexpected bits of square and
   court had indeed delighted me, and when I found the poets and artists to
   be loud-voiced pretenders whose quaintness is tinsel and whose lives are a
   denial of all that pure beauty which is poetry and art, I stayed on for
   love of these venerable things. I fancied them as they were in their
   prime, when Greenwich was a placid village not yet engulfed by the town;
   and in the hours before dawn, when all the revellers had slunk away, I
   used to wander alone among their cryptical windings and brood upon the
   curious arcana which generations must have deposited there. This kept my
   soul alive, and gave me a few of those dreams and visions for which the
   poet far within me cried out.

   The man came upon me at about two one cloudy August morning, as I was
   threading a series of detached courtyards; now accessible only through the
   unlighted hallways of intervening buildings, but once forming parts of a
   continuous network of picturesque alleys. I had heard of them by vague
   rumor, and realized that they could not be upon any map of today; but the
   fact that they were forgotten only endeared them to me, so that I had
   sought them with twice my usual eagerness. Now that I had found them, my
   eagerness was again redoubled; for something in their arrangement dimly
   hinted that they might be only a few of many such, with dark, dumb
   counterparts wedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls and deserted rear
   tenements, or lurking lamplessly behind archways unbetrayed by hordes of
   the foreign-speaking or guarded by furtive and uncommunicative artists
   whose practises do not invite publicity or the light of day.

   He spoke to me without invitation, noting my mood and glances as I studied
   certain knockered doorways above iron-railed steps, the pallid glow of
   traceried transoms feebly lighting my face. His own face was in shadow,
   and he wore a wide-brimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the
   out-of-date cloak he affected; but I was subtly disquieted even before he
   addressed me. His form was very slight; thin almost to cadaverousness; and
   his voice proved phenomenally soft and hollow, though not particularly
   deep. He had, he said, noticed me several times at my wanderings; and
   inferred that I resembled him in loving the vestiges of former years.
   Would I not like the guidance of one long practised in these explorations,
   and possessed of local information profoundly deeper than any which an
   obvious newcomer could possibly have gained?

   As he spoke, I caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a
   solitary attic window. It was a noble, even a handsome elderly
   countenance; and bore the marks of a lineage and refinement unusual for
   the age and place. Yet some quality about it disturbed me almost as much
   as its features pleased me - perhaps it was too white, or too
   expressionless, or too much out of keeping with the locality, to make me
   feel easy or comfortable. Nevertheless I followed him; for in those dreary
   days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that I had to keep my
   soul alive, and I reckoned it a rare favor of Fate to fall in with one
   whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than
   mine.

   Something in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence and for a
   long hour he led me forward without needless words; making only the
   briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes, and
   directing my progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed through
   interstices, tiptoed through corridors clambered over brick walls, and
   once crawled on hands and knees through a low, arched passage of stone
   whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at last every hint of
   geographical location I had managed to preserve. The things we saw were
   very old and marvelous, or at least they seemed so in the few straggling
   rays of light by which I viewed them, and I shall never forget the
   tottering Ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urn-headed iron
   fenceposts and flaring-linteled windows and decorative fanlights that
   appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this
   inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity.

   We met no person, and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and
   fewer. The streetlights we first encountered had been of oil, and of the
   ancient lozenge pattern. Later I noticed some with candles; and at last,
   after traversing a horrible unlighted court where my guide had to lead
   with his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooded gate in a
   high wall, we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by lanterns in front
   of every seventh house - unbelievably Colonial tin lanterns with conical
   tops and holes punched in the sides. This alley led steeply uphill - more
   steeply than I thought possible in this part of New York - and the upper
   end was blocked squarely by the ivy-clad wall of a private estate, beyond
   which I could see a pale cupola, and the tops of trees waving against a
   vague lightness in the sky. In this wall was a small, low-arched gate of
   nail-studded black oak, which the man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous
   key. Leading me within, he steered a course in utter blackness over what
   seemed to be a gravel path, and finally up a flight of stone steps to the
   door of the house, which he unlocked and opened for me.

   We entered, and as we did so I grew faint from a reek of infinite
   mustiness which welled out to meet us, and which must have been the fruit
   of unwholesome centuries of decay. My host appeared not to notice this,
   and in courtesy I kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway,
   across a hall, and into a room whose door I heard him lock behind us. Then
   I saw him pull the curtains of the three small-paned windows that barely
   showed themselves against the lightening sky; after which he crossed to
   the mantel, struck flint and steel, lighted two candles of a candelabrum
   of twelve sconces, and made a gesture enjoining soft-toned speech.

   In this feeble radiance I saw that we were in a spacious, well-furnished
   and paneled library dating from the first quarter of the Eighteenth
   Century, with splendid doorway pediments, a delightful Doric cornice, and
   a magnificently carved overmantel with scroll-and-urn top. Above the
   crowded bookshelves at intervals along the walls were well-wrought family
   portraits; all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness, and bearing an
   unmistakable likeness to the man who now motioned me to a chair beside the
   graceful Chippendale table. Before seating himself across the tahle from
   me, my host paused for a moment as if in embarrassment; then, tardily
   removing his gloves, wide-brimmed hat, and cloak, stood theatrically
   revealed in full mid-Georgian costume from queued hair and neck ruffles to
   knee-breeches, silk hose, and the buckled shoes I had not previously
   noticed. Now slowly sinking into a lyre-back chair, he commenced to eye me
   intently.

   Without his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely
   visible before, and I wondered if this unperceived mark of singular
   longevity were not one of the sources of my disquiet. When he spoke at
   length, his soft, hollow, and carefully muffled voice not infrequently
   quavered; and now and then I had great difficulty in following him as I
   listened with a thrill of amazement and half-disavowed alarm which grew
   each instant.

   "You behold, Sir," my host began, "a man of very eccentrical habits for
   whose costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit and
   inclinations. Reflecting upon better times, I have not scrupled to
   ascertain their ways, and adopt their dress and manners; an indulgence
   which offends none if practised without ostentation. It hath been my good
   fortune to retain the rural seat of my ancestors, swallowed though it was
   by two towns, first Greenwich, which built up hither after 1800, then New
   York, which joined on near 1830. There were many reasons for the close
   keeping of this place in my family, and I have not been remiss in
   discharging such obligations. The squire who succeeded to it in 1768
   studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries, all connected with
   influences residing in this particular plot of ground, and eminently
   desarving of the strongest guarding. Some curious effects of these arts
   and discoveries I now purpose to show you, under the strictest secrecy;
   and I believe I may rely on my judgement of men enough to have no distrust
   of either your interest or your fidelity."

   He paused, but I could only nod my head. I have said that I was alarmed,
   yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of
   New York, and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of
   dangerous arts, I had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of
   wonder on whatever he might have to offer. So I listened.

   "To - my ancestor," he softly continued, "there appeared to reside some
   very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a
   little-suspected dominance not only over the acts of one's self and of
   others, but over every variety of force and substance in Nature, and over
   many elements and dimensions deemed more universal than Nature herself.
   May I say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and
   time and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half-breed red
   Indians once encamped upon this hill? These Indians showed choler when the
   place was built, and were plaguey pestilent in asking to visit the grounds
   at the full of the moon. For years they stole over the wall each month
   when they could, and by stealth performed sartain acts. Then, in '68, the
   new squire catched them at their doings, and stood still at what he saw.
   Thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his
   grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did, larning that their
   grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an
   old Dutchman in the time of the States-General. Arid pox on him, I'm
   afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum - whether or
   not by intent - for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man
   living that knew it. You, Sir, are the first outsider to be told there is
   a secret, and split me if I'd have risked tampering that much with - the
   powers - had ye not been so hot after bygone things."

   I shuddered as the man grew colloquial - and with the familiar speech of
   another day. He went on.

   "But you must know, Sir, that what - the squire - got from those mongrel
   savages was but a small part of the larning he came to have. He had not
   been at Oxford for nothing, nor talked to no account with an ancient
   chymist and astrologer in Paris. He was, in fine, made sensible that all
   the world is but the smoke of our intellects; past the bidding of the
   vulgar, but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any cloud of
   prime Virginia tobacco. What we want, we may make about us; and what we
   don't want, we may sweep away. I won't say that all this is wholly true in
   body, but 'tis sufficient true to furnish a very pretty spectacle now and
   then. You, I conceive, would be tickled hy a better sight of sartain other
   years than your fancy affords you; so be pleased to hold back any fright
   at what I design to show. Come to the window and be quiet."

   My host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the long
   side of the malodorous room, and at the first touch of his ungloved
   fingers I turned cold. His flesh, though dry and firm, was of the quality
   of ice; and I almost shrank away from his pulling. But again I thought of
   the emptiness and horror of reality, and boldly prepared to follow
   whithersoever I might be led. Once at the window, the man drew apart the
   yellow silk curtains and directed my stare into the blackness outside. For
   a moment I saw nothing save a myriad of tiny dancing lights, far, far
   before me. Then, as if in response to an insidious motion of my host's
   hand, a flash of heat-lightning played over the scene, and I looked out
   upon a sea of luxuriant foliage - foliage unpolluted, and not the sea of
   roofs to be expected by any normal mind. On my right the Hudson glittered
   wickedly, and in the distance ahead I saw the unhealthy shimmer of a vast
   salt marsh constellated with nervous fireflies. The flash died, and an
   evil smile illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancer.

   "That was before my time - before the new squire's time. Pray let us try
   again."

   I was faint, even fainter than the hateful modernity of that accursed city
   had made me.

   "Good God!" I whispered, "can you do that for any time?" And as he nodded,
   and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow fangs, I clutched
   at the curtains to prevent myself from falling. But he steadied me with
   that terrible, ice-cold claw, and once more made his insidious gesture.

   Again the lightning flashed - but this time upon a scene not wholly
   strange. It was Greenwich, the Greenwich that used to be, with here and
   there a roof or row of houses as we see it now, yet with lovely green
   lanes and fields and bits of grassy common. The marsh still glittered
   beyond, but in the farther distance I saw the steeples of what was then
   all of New York; Trinity and St. Paul's and the Brick Church dominating
   their sisters, and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole. I
   breathed hard, but not so much from the sight itself as from the
   possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured up.

   "Can you - dare you - go far?" I spoke with awe and I think he shared it
   for a second, but the evil grin returned.

   "Far? What I have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone! Back, back
   - forward, forward - look ye puling lackwit!"

   And as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew bringing to
   the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before. For full
   three seconds I could glimpse that pandemoniac sight, and in those seconds
   I saw a vista which will ever afterward torment me in dreams. I saw the
   heavens verminous with strange flying things, and beneath them a hellish
   black city of giant stone terraces with impious pyramids flung savagely to
   the moon, and devil-lights burning from unnumbered windows. And swarming
   loathsomely on aerial galleries I saw the yellow, squint-eyed people of
   that city, robed horribly in orange and red, and dancing insanely to the
   pounding of fevered kettle-drums, the clatter of obscene crotala, and the
   maniacal moaning of muted horns whose ceaseless dirges rose and fell
   undulantly like the wave of an unhallowed ocean of bitumen.

   I saw this vista, I say, and heard as with the mind's ear the blasphemous
   domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it. It was the shrieking
   fulfilment of all the horror which that corpse-city had ever stirred in my
   soul, and forgetting every injunction to silence I screamed and screamed
   and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about me.

   Then, as the flash subsided, I saw that my host was trembling too; a look
   of shocking fear half-blotting from his face the serpent distortion of
   rage which my screams had excited. He tottered, clutched at the curtains
   as I had done before, and wriggled his head wildly, like a hunted animal.
   God knows he had cause, for as the echoes of my screaming died away there
   came another sound so hellishly suggestive that only numbed emotion kept
   me sane and conscious. It was the steady, stealthy creaking of the stairs
   beyond the locked door, as with the ascent of a barefoot or skin-shod
   horde; and at last the cautious, purposeful rattling of the brass latch
   that glowed in the feeble candlelight. The old man clawed and spat at me
   through the moldy air, and barked things in his throat as he swayed with
   the yellow curtain he clutched.

   "The full moon - damn ye - ye... ye yelping dog - ye called 'em, and
   they've come for me! Moccasined feet - dead men - Gad sink ye, ye red
   devils, but I poisoned no rum o' yours - han't I kept your pox-rotted
   magic safe - ye swilled yourselves sick, curse ye, and yet must needs
   blame the squire - let go, you! Unhand that latch - I've naught for ye
   here - "

   At this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of the
   door, and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic magician. His
   fright, turning to steely despair, left room for a resurgence of his rage
   against me; and he staggered a step toward the table on whose edge I was
   steadying myself. The curtains, still clutched in his right hand as his
   left clawed out at me, grew taut and finally crashed down from their lofty
   fastenings; admitting to the room a flood of that full moonlight which the
   brightening of the sky had presaged. In those greenish beams the candles
   paled, and a new semblance of decay spread over the musk-reeking room with
   its wormy paneling, sagging floor, battered mantel, rickety furniture, and
   ragged draperies. It spread over the old man, too, whether from the same
   source or because of his fear and vehemence, and I saw him shrivel and
   blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine talons.
   Only his eyes stayed whole, and they glared with a propulsive, dilated
   incandescence which grew as the face around them charred and dwindled.

   The rapping was now repeated with greater insistence, and this time bore a
   hint of metal. The black thing facing me had become only a head with eyes,
   impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking floor in my direction, and
   occasionally emitting feeble little spits of immortal malice. Now swift
   and splintering blows assailed the sickly panels, and I saw the gleam of a
   tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood. I did not move, for I could not;
   but watched dazedly as the door fell in pieces to admit a colossal,
   shapeless influx of inky substance starred with shining, malevolent eyes.
   It poured thickly, like a flood of oil bursting a rotten bulkhead,
   overturned a chair as it spread, and finally flowed under the table and
   across the room to where the blackened head with the eyes still glared at
   me. Around that head it closed, totally swallowing it up, and in another
   moment it had begun to recede; bearing away its invisible burden without
   touching me, and flowing again out that black doorway and down the unseen
   stairs, which creaked as before, though in reverse order.

   Then the floor gave way at last, and I slid gaspingly down into the
   nighted chamber below, choking with cobwebs and half-swooning with terror.
   The green moon, shining through broken windows, showed me the hall door
   half open; and as I rose from the plaster-strewn floor and twisted myself
   free from the sagged ceiling, I saw sweep past it an awful torrent of
   blackness, with scores of baleful eyes glowing in it. It was seeking the
   door to the cellar, and when it found it, vanished therein. I now felt the
   floor of this lower room giving as that of the upper chamber had done, and
   once a crashing above had been followed by the fall past the west window
   of some thing which must have been the cupola. Now liberated for the
   instant from the wreckage, I rushed through the hall to the front door and
   finding myself unable to open it, seized a chair and broke a window,
   climbing frenziedly out upon the unkempt lawn where moon light danced over
   yard-high grass and weeds. The wall was high and all the gates were locked
   but moving a pile of boxes in a corner I managed to gain the top and cling
   to the great stone urn set there.

   About me in my exhaustion I could see only strange walls and windows and
   old gambrel roofs. The steep street of my approach was nowhere visible,
   and the little I did see succumbed rapidly to a mist that rolled in from
   the river despite the glaring moonlight. Suddenly the urn to which I clung
   began to tremble, as if sharing my own lethal dizziness; and in another
   instant my body was plunging downward to I knew not what fate.

   The man who found me said that I must have crawled a long way despite my
   broken bones, for a trail of blood stretched off as far as he dared look.
   The gathering rain soon effaced this link with the scene of my ordeal, and
   reports could state no more than that I had appeared from a place unknown,
   at the entrance to a little black court off Perry Street.

   I never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths, nor would I direct
   any sane man thither if I could. Of who or what that ancient creature was,
   I have no idea; but I repeat that the city is dead and full of unsuspected
   horrors. Whither he has gone, I do not know; but I have gone home to the
   pure New England lanes up which fragrant sea-winds sweep at evening.
