   The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and
   strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown. These facts few
   psychologists will dispute, and their admitted truth must establish for
   all time the genuineness and dignity of the weirdly horrible tale as a
   literary form. Against it are discharged all the shafts of a materialistic
   sophistication which clings to frequently felt emotions and external
   events, and of a naively insipid idealism which deprecates the aesthetic
   motive and calls for a didactic literature to "uplift" the reader toward a
   suitable degree of smirking optimism. But in spite of all this opposition
   the weird tale has survived, developed, and attained remarkable heights of
   perfection; founded as it is on a profound and elementary principle whose
   appeal, if not always universal, must necessarily be poignant and
   permanent to minds of the requisite sensitiveness.

   The appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it
   demands from the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity for
   detachment from everyday life. Relatively few are free enough from the
   spell of the daily routine to respond to tappings from outside, and tales
   of ordinary feelings and events, or of common sentimental distortions of
   such feelings and events, will always take first place in the taste of the
   majority; rightly, perhaps, since of course these ordinary matters make up
   the greater part of human experience. But the sensitive are always with
   us, and sometimes a curious streak of fancy invades an obscure corner of
   the very hardest head; so that no amount of rationalisation, reform, or
   Freudian analysis can quite annul the thrill of the chimney-corner whisper
   or the lonely wood. There is here involved a psychological pattern or
   tradition as real and as deeply grounded in mental experience as any other
   pattern or tradition of mankind; coeval with the religious feeling and
   closely related to many aspects of it, and too much a part of our
   innermost biological heritage to lose keen potency over a very important,
   though not numerically great, minority of our species.

   Man's first instincts and emotions formed his response to the environment
   in which he found himself. Definite feelings based on pleasure and pain
   grew up around the phenomena whose causes and effects he understood,
   whilst around those which he did not understand -- and the universe teemed
   with them in the early days -- were naturally woven such personifications,
   marvelous interpretations, and sensations of awe and fear as would be hit
   upon by a race having few and simple ideas and limited experience. The
   unknown, being likewise the unpredictable, became for our primitive
   forefathers a terrible and omnipotent source of boons and calamities
   visited upon mankind for cryptic and wholly extra-terrestrial reasons, and
   thus clearly belonging to spheres of existence whereof we know nothing and
   wherein we have no part. The phenomenon of dreaming likewise helped to
   build up the notion of an unreal or spiritual world; and in general, all
   the conditions of savage dawn -- life so strongly conduced toward a
   feeling of the supernatural, that we need not wonder at the thoroughness
   with which man's very hereditary essence has become saturated with
   religion and superstition. That saturation must, as a matter of plain
   scientific fact, be regarded as virtually permanent so far as the
   subconscious mind and inner instincts are concerned; for though the area
   of the unknown has been steadily contracting for thousands of years, an
   infinite reservoir of mystery still engulfs most of the outer cosmos,
   whilst a vast residuum of powerful inherited associations clings round all
   the objects and processes that were once mysterious; however well they may
   now be explained. And more than this, there is an actual physiological
   fixation of the old instincts in our nervous tissue, which would make them
   obscurely operative even were the conscious mind to be purged of all
   sources of wonder.

   Because we remember pain and the menace of death more vividly than
   pleasure, and because our feelings toward the beneficent aspects of the
   unknown have from the first been captured and formalised by conventional
   religious rituals, it has fallen to the lot of the darker and more
   maleficent side of cosmic mystery to figure chiefly in our popular
   supernatural folklore. This tendency, too, is naturally enhanced by the
   fact that uncertainty and danger are always closely allied; thus making
   any kind of an unknown world a world of peril and evil possibilities. When
   to this sense of fear and evil the inevitable fascination of wonder and
   curiosity is superadded, there is born a composite body of keen emotion
   and imaginative provocation whose vitality must of necessity endure as
   long as the human race itself. Children will always be afraid of the dark,
   and men with minds sensitive to hereditary impulse will always tremble at
   the thought of the hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may
   pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars, or press hideously upon our own
   globe in unholy dimensions which only the dead and the moonstruck can
   glimpse.

   With this foundation, no one need wonder at the existence of a literature
   of cosmic fear. It has always existed, and always will exist; and no
   better evidence of its tenacious vigour can be cited than the impulse
   which now and then drives writers of totally opposite leanings to try
   their hands at it in isolated tales, as if to discharge from their minds
   certain phantasmal shapes which would otherwise haunt them. Thus Dickens
   wrote several eerie narratives; Browning, the hideous poem Childe Roland;
   Henry James, The Turn of the Screw; Dr. Holmes, the subtle novel Elsie
   Venner; F. Marion Crawford, The Upper Berth and a number of other
   examples; Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, social worker, The Yellow Wall
   Paper; whilst the humorist, W. W. Jacobs, produced that able melodramatic
   bit called The Monkey's Paw.

   This type of fear-literature must not be confounded with a type externally
   similar but psychologically widely different; the literature of mere
   physical fear and the mundanely gruesome. Such writing, to be sure, has
   its place, as has the conventional or even whimsical or humorous ghost
   story where formalism or the author's knowing wink removes the true sense
   of the morbidly unnatural; but these things are not the literature of
   cosmic fear in its purest sense. The true weird tale has something more
   than secret murder, bloody bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains
   according to rule. A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable
   dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; and there must be a hint,
   expressed with a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject, of
   that most terrible conception of the human brain -- a malign and
   particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are
   our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of
   unplumbed space.

   Naturally we cannot expect all weird tales to conform absolutely to any
   theoretical model. Creative minds are uneven, and the best of fabrics have
   their dull spots. Moreover, much of the choicest weird work is
   unconscious; appearing in memorable fragments scattered through material
   whose massed effect may be of a very different cast. Atmosphere is the
   all-important thing, for the final criterion of authenticity is not the
   dovetailing of a plot but the creation of a given sensation. We may say,
   as a general thing, that a weird story whose intent is to teach or produce
   a social effect, or one in which the horrors are finally explained away by
   natural means, is not a genuine tale of cosmic fear; but it remains a fact
   that such narratives often possess, in isolated sections, atmospheric
   touches which fulfill every condition of true supernatural
   horror-literature. Therefore we must judge a weird tale not by the
   author's intent, or by the mere mechanics of the plot; but by the
   emotional level which it attains at its least mundane point. If the proper
   sensations are excited, such a "high spot" must be admitted on its own
   merits as weird literature, no matter how prosaically it is later dragged
   down. The one test of the really weird is simply this -- whether of not
   there be excited in the reader a profound sense of dread, and of contact
   with unknown spheres and powers; a subtle attitude of awed listening, as
   if for the beating of black wings or the scratching of outside shapes and
   entities on the known universe's utmost rim. And of course, the more
   completely and unifiedly a story conveys this atmosphere the better it is
   as a work of art in the given medium.

                        II. The Dawn Of The Horror Tale

   As may naturally be expected of a form so closely connected with primal
   emotion, the horror-tale is as old as human thought and speech themselves.

   Cosmic terror appears as an ingredient of the earliest folklore of all
   races, and is crystallised in the most archaic ballads, chronicles, and
   sacred writings. It was, indeed, a prominent feature of the elaborate
   ceremonial magic, with its rituals for the evocation of daemons and
   spectres, which flourished from prehistoric times, and which reached its
   highest development in Egypt and the Semitic nations. Fragments like the
   Book of Enoch and the Claviculae of Solomon well illustrate the power of
   the weird over the ancient Eastern mind, and upon such things were based
   enduring systems and traditions whose echoes extend obscurely even to the
   present time. Touches of this transcendental fear are seen in classic
   literature, and there is evidence of its still greater emphasis in a
   ballad literature which paralleled the classic stream but vanished for
   lack of a written medium. The Middle Ages, steeped in fanciful darkness,
   gave it an enormous impulse toward expression; and East and West alike
   were busy preserving and amplifying the dark heritage, both of random
   folklore and of academically formulated magic and cabalism, which had
   descended to them. Witch, werewolf, vampire, and ghoul brooded ominously
   on the lips of bard and grandam, and needed but little encouragement to
   take the final step across the boundary that divides the chanted tale or
   song from the formal literary composition. In the Orient, the weird tale
   tended to assume a gorgeous colouring and sprightliness which almost
   transmuted it into sheer phantasy. In the West, where the mystical Teuton
   had come down from his black boreal forests and the Celt remembered
   strange sacrifices in Druidic groves, it assumed a terrible intensity and
   convincing seriousness of atmosphere which doubled the force of its
   half-told, half-hinted horrors.

   Much of the power of Western horror-lore was undoubtedly due to the hidden
   but often suspected presence of a hideous cult of nocturnal worshippers
   whose strange customs -- descended from pre-Aryan and pre-agricultural
   times when a squat race of Mongoloids roved over Europe with their flocks
   and herds -- were rooted in the most revolting fertility-rites of
   immemorial antiquity. Ibis secret religion, stealthily handed down amongst
   peasants for thousands of years despite the outward reign of the Druidic,
   Graeco-Roman, and Christian faiths in the regions involved, was marked by
   wild "Witches' Sabbaths" in lonely woods and atop distant hills on
   Walpurgis-Night and Hallowe'en, the traditional breeding-seasons of the
   goats and sheep and cattle; and became the source of vast riches of
   sorcery-legend, besides provoking extensive witchcraft -- prosecutions of
   which the Salem affair forms the chief American example. Akin to it in
   essence, and perhaps connected with it in fact, was the frightful secret
   system of inverted theology or Satan-worship which produced such horrors
   as the famous "Black Mass"; whilst operating toward the same end we may
   note the activities of those whose aims were somewhat more scientific or
   philosophical -- the astrologers, cabalists, and alchemists of the
   Albertus Magnus or Ramond Lully type, with whom such rude ages invariably
   abound. The prevalence and depth of the mediaeval horror-spirit in Europe,
   intensified by the dark despair which waves of pestilence brought, may be
   fairly gauged by the grotesque carvings slyly introduced into much of the
   finest later Gothic ecclesiastical work of the time; the daemoniac
   gargoyles of Notre Dame and Mont St. Michel being among the most famous
   specimens. And throughout the period, it must be remembered, there existed
   amongst educated and uneducated alike a most unquestioning faith in every
   form of the supernatural; from the gentlest doctrines of Christianity to
   the most monstrous morbidities of witchcraft and black magic. It was from
   no empty background that the Renaissance magicians and alchemists --
   Nostradamus, Trithemius, Dr. John Dee, Robert Fludd, and the like -- were
   born.

   In this fertile soil were nourished types and characters of sombre myth
   and legend which persist in weird literature to this day, more or less
   disguised or altered by modern technique. Many of them were taken from the
   earliest oral sources, and form part of mankind's permanent heritage. The
   shade which appears and demands the burial of its bones, the daemon lover
   who comes to bear away his still living bride, the death-fiend or
   psychopomp riding the night-wind, the man-wolf, the sealed chamber, the
   deathless sorcerer -- all these may be found in that curious body of
   mediaeval lore which the late Mr. Baring-Gould so effectively assembled in
   book form. Wherever the mystic Northern blood was strongest, the
   atmosphere of the popular tales became most intense; for in the Latin
   races there is a touch of basic rationality which denies to even their
   strangest superstitions many of the overtones of glamour so characteristic
   of our own forest-born and ice-fostered whisperings.

   Just as all fiction first found extensive embodiment in poetry, so is it
   in poetry that we first encounter the permanent entry of the weird into
   standard literature. Most of the ancient instances, curiously enough, are
   in prose; as the werewolf incident in Petronius, the gruesome passages in
   Apuleius, the brief but celebrated letter of Pliny the Younger to Sura,
   and the odd compilation On Wonderful Events by the Emperor Hadrian's Greek
   freedman, Phlegon. It is in Phlegon that we first find that hideous tale
   of the corpse-bride, Philinnion and Machates, later related by Proclus and
   in modem times forming the inspiration of Goethe's Bride of Corinth and
   Washington Irving's German Student. But by the time the old Northern myths
   take literary form, and in that later time when the weird appears as a
   steady element in the literature of the day, we find it mostly in metrical
   dress; as indeed we find the greater part of the strictly imaginative
   writing of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The Scandinavian Eddas and
   Sagas thunder with cosmic horror, and shake with the stark fear of Ymir
   and his shapeless spawn; whilst our own Anglo-Saxon Beowulf and the later
   Continental Nibelung tales are full of eldritch weirdness. Dante is a
   pioneer in the classic capture of macabre atmosphere, and in Spenser's
   stately stanzas will be seen more than a few touches of fantastic terror
   in landscape, incident, and character. Prose literature gives us Malory's
   Morte d'Arthur, in which are presented many ghastly situations taken from
   early ballad sources -- the theft of the sword and silk from the corpse in
   Chapel Perilous by Sir Galahad -- whilst other and cruder specimens were
   doubtless set forth in the cheap and sensational "chapbooks" vulgarly
   hawked about and devoured by the ignorant. In Elizabethan drama, with its
   Dr. Faustus, the witches in Macbeth, the ghost in Hamlet, and the horrible
   gruesomeness of Webster we may easily discern the strong hold of the
   daemoniac on the public mind; a hold intensified by the very real fear of
   living witchcraft, whose terrors, wildest at first on the Continent, begin
   to echo loudly in English ears as the witch-hunting crusades of James the
   First gain headway. To the lurking mystical prose of the ages is added a
   long line of treatises on witchcraft and daemonology which aid in exciting
   the imagination of the reading world.

   Through the seventeenth and into the eighteenth century we behold a
   growing mass of fugitive legendry and balladry of darksome cast; still,
   however, held down beneath the surface of polite and accepted literature.
   Chapbooks of horror and weirdness multiplied, and we glimpse the eager
   interest of the people through fragments like Defoe's Apparition of Mrs.
   Veal, a homely tale of a dead woman's spectral visit to a distant friend,
   written to advertise covertly a badly selling theological disquisition on
   death. The upper orders of society were now losing faith in the
   supernatural, and indulging in a period of classic rationalism. Then,
   beginning with the translations of Eastern tales in Queen Anne's reign and
   taking definite form toward the middle of the century, comes the revival
   of romantic feeling -- the era of new joy in nature, and in the radiance
   of past times, strange scenes, bold deeds, and incredible marvels. We feel
   it first in the poets, whose utterances take on new qualities of wonder,
   strangeness, and shuddering. And finally, after the timid appearance of a
   few weird scenes in the novels of the day -- such as Smollett's Adventures
   of Ferdinand, Count Fathom -- the release instinct precipitates itself in
   the birth of a new school of writing; the "Gothic" school of horrible and
   fantastic prose fiction, long and short, whose literary posterity is
   destined to become so numerous, and in many cases so resplendent in
   artistic merit. It is, when one reflects upon it, genuinely remarkable
   that weird narration as a fixed and academically recognized literary form
   should have been so late of final birth. The impulse and atmosphere are as
   old as man, but the typical weird tale of standard literature is a child
   of the eighteenth century.

                          III. The Early Gothic Novel

   The shadow-haunted landscapes of Ossian, the chaotic visions of William
   Blake, the grotesque witch dances in Burns's Tam O'Shanter, the sinister
   daemonism of Coleridge's Christobel and Rime of the Ancient Mariner, the
   ghostly charm of James Hogg's Kilmeny, and the more restrained approaches
   to cosmic horror in Lamia and many of Keats's other poems, are typical
   British illustrations of the advent of the weird to formal literature. Our
   Teutonic cousins of the Continent were equally receptive to the rising
   flood, and Burger's Wild Huntsman and the even more famous
   daemon-bridegroom ballad of Lenore -- both imitated in English by Scott,
   whose respect for the supernatural was always great -- are only a taste of
   the eerie wealth which German song had commenced to provide. Thomas Moore
   adapted from such sources the legend of the ghoulish statue-bride (later
   used by Prosper Merimee in The Venus of Ille, and traceable back to great
   antiquity) which echoes so shiveringly in his ballad of The Ring; whilst
   Goethe's deathless masterpiece Faust, crossing from mere balladry into the
   classic, cosmic tragedy of the ages, may be held as the ultimate height to
   which this German poetic impulse arose.

   But it remained for a very sprightly and worldly Englishman -- none other
   than Horace Walpole himself -- to give the growing impulse definite shape
   and become the actual founder of the literary horror-story as a permanent
   form. Fond of mediaeval romance and mystery as a dilettante's diversion,
   and with a quaintly imitated Gothic castle as his abode at Strawberry
   Hill, Walpole in 1764 published The Castle of Otranto; a tale of the
   supernatural which, though thoroughly unconvincing and mediocre in itself,
   was destined to exert an almost unparalleled influence on the literature
   of the weird. First venturing it only as a "translation" by one "William
   Marshal, Gent." from the Italian of a mythical "Onuphrio Muralto," the
   author later acknowledged his connection with the book and took pleasure
   in its wide and instantaneous popularity -- a popularity which extended to
   many editions, early dramatization, and wholesale imitation both in
   England and in Germany.

   The story -- tedious, artificial, and melodramatic -- is further impaired
   by a brisk and prosaic style whose urbane sprightliness nowhere permits
   the creation of a truly weird atmosphere. It tells of Manfred, an
   unscrupulous and usurping prince determined to found a line, who after the
   mysterious sudden death of his only son Conrad on the latter's bridal
   morn, attempts to put away his wife Hippolita and wed the lady destined
   for the unfortunate youth -- the lad, by the way, having been crushed by
   the preternatural fall of a gigantic helmet in the castle courtyard.
   Isabella, the widowed bride, flees from his design; and encounters in
   subterranean crypts beneath the castle a noble young preserver, Theodore,
   who seems to be a peasant yet strangely resembles the old lord Alfonso who
   ruled the domain before Manfred's time. Shortly thereafter supernatural
   phenomena assail the castle in diverse ways; fragments of gigantic armour
   being discovered here and there, a portrait walking out of its frame, a
   thunderclap destroying the edifice, and a colossal armoured spectre of
   Alfonso rising out of the rains to ascend through parting clouds to the
   bosom of St. Nicholas. Theodore, having wooed Manfred's daughter Matilda
   and lost her through death -- for she is slain by her father by mistake --
   is discovered to be the son of Alfonso and rightful heir to the estate. He
   concludes the tale by wedding Isabella and preparing to live happily ever
   after, whilst Manfred -- whose usurpation was the cause of his son's
   supernatural death and his own supernatural harassings -- retires to a
   monastery for penitence; his saddened wife seeking asylum in a
   neighbouring convent.

   Such is the tale; flat, stilted, and altogether devoid of the true cosmic
   horror which makes weird literature. Yet such was the thirst of the age
   for those touches of strangeness and spectral antiquity which it reflects,
   that it was seriously received by the soundest readers and raised in spite
   of its intrinsic ineptness to a pedestal of lofty importance in literary
   history. What it did above all else was to create a novel type of scene,
   puppet-characters, and incidents; which, handled to better advantage by
   writers more naturally adapted to weird creation, stimulated the growth of
   an imitative Gothic school which in turn inspired the real weavers of
   cosmic terror -- the line of actual artists beginning with Poe. This novel
   dramatic paraphernalia consisted first of all of the Gothic castle, with
   its awesome antiquity, vast distances and ramblings, deserted or ruined
   wings, damp corridors, unwholesome hidden catacombs, and galaxy of ghosts
   and appalling legends, as a nucleus of suspense and daemoniac fright. In
   addition, it included the tyrannical and malevolent nobleman as villain;
   the saintly, long-persecuted, and generally insipid heroine who undergoes
   the major terrors and serves as a point of view and focus for the reader's
   sympathies; the valorous and immaculate hero, always of high birth but
   often in humble disguise; the convention of high-sounding foreign names,
   mostly Italian, for the characters; and the infinite array of stage
   properties which includes strange lights, damp trap-doors, extinguished
   lamps, mouldy hidden manuscripts, creaking hinges, shaking arras, and the
   like. All this paraphernalia reappears with amusing sameness, yet
   sometimes with tremendous effect, throughout the history of the Gothic
   novel; and is by no means extinct even today, though subtler technique now
   forces it to assume a less naive and obvious form. An harmonious milieu
   for a new school had been found, and the writing world was not slow to
   grasp the opportunity.

   German romance at once responded to the Walpole influence, and soon became
   a byword for the weird and ghastly. In England one of the first imitators
   was the celebrated Mrs. Barbauld, then Miss Aikin, who in 1773 published
   an unfinished fragment called Sir Bertrand, in which the strings of
   genuine terror were truly touched with no clumsy hand. A nobleman on a
   dark and lonely moor, attracted by a tolling bell and distant light,
   enters a strange and ancient turreted castle whose doors open and close
   and whose bluish will-o'-the-wisps lead up mysterious staircases toward
   dead hands and animated black statues. A coffin with a dead lady, whom Sir
   Bertrand kisses, is finally reached; and upon the kiss the scene dissolves
   to give place to a splendid apartment where the lady, restored to life,
   holds a banquet in honor of her rescuer. Walpole admired this tale, though
   he accorded less respect to an even more prominent offspring of his
   Otranto -- The Old English Baron, by Clara Reeve, published in 1777. Truly
   enough, this tale lacks the real vibration to the note of outer darkness
   and mystery which distinguishes Mrs. Barbauld's fragment; and though less
   crude than Walpole's novel, and more artistically economical of horror in
   its possession of only one spectral figure, it is nevertheless too
   definitely insipid for greatness. Here again we have the virtuous heir to
   the castle disguised as a peasant and restored to his heritage through the
   ghost of his father; and here again we have a case of wide popularity
   leading to many editions, dramatization, and ultimate translation into
   French. Miss Reeve wrote another weird novel, unfortunately unpublished
   and lost.

   The Gothic novel was now settled as a literary form, and instances
   multiply bewilderingly as the eighteenth century draws toward its close.
   The Recess, written in 1785 by Mrs. Sophia Lee, has the historic element,
   revolving round the twin daughters of Mary, Queen of Scots; and though
   devoid of the supernatural, employs the Walpole scenery and mechanism with
   great dexterity. Five years later, and all existing lamps are paled by the
   rising of a fresh luminary order -- Mrs. Ann Radcliffe (1764-1823), whose
   famous novels made terror and suspense a fashion, and who set new and
   higher standards in the domain of macabre and fear-inspiring atmosphere
   despite a provoking custom of destroying her own phantoms at the last
   through labored mechanical explanations. To the familiar Gothic trappings
   of her predecessors Mrs. Radcliffe added a genuine sense of the unearthly
   in scene and incident which closely approached genius; every touch of
   setting and action contributing artistically to the impression of
   illimitable frightfulness which she wished to convey. A few sinister
   details like a track of blood on castle stairs, a groan from a distant
   vault, or a weird song in a nocturnal forest can with her conjure up the
   most powerful images of imminent horror; surpassing by far the extravagant
   and toilsome elaborations of others. Nor are these images in themselves
   any the less potent because they are explained away before the end of the
   novel. Mrs. Radcliffe's visual imagination was very strong, and appears as
   much in her delightful landscape touches -- always in broad, glamorously
   pictorial outline, and never in close detail -- as in her weird
   phantasies. Her prime weaknesses, aside from the habit of prosaic
   disillusionment, are a tendency toward erroneous geography and history and
   a fatal predilection for bestrewing her novels with insipid little poems,
   attributed to one or another of the characters.

   Mrs. Radcliffe wrote six novels; The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne
   (1789), A Sicilian Romance (1790), The Romance of the Forest (1792), The
   Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), The Italian (1797), and Gaston de
   Blondeville, composed in 1802 but first published posthumously in 1826. Of
   these Udolpho is by far the most famous, and may be taken as a type of the
   early Gothic tale at its best. It is the chronicle of Emily, a young
   Frenchwoman transplanted to an ancient and portentous castle in the
   Apennines through the death of her parents and the marriage of her aunt to
   the lord of the castle -- the scheming nobleman, Montoni. Mysterious
   sounds, opened doors, frightful legends, and a nameless horror in a niche
   behind a black veil all operate in quick succession to unnerve the heroine
   and her faithful attendant, Annette; but finally, after the death of her
   aunt, she escapes with the aid of a fellow-prisoner whom she has
   discovered. On the way home she stops at a chateau filled with fresh
   horrors -- the abandoned wing where the departed chatelaine dwelt, and the
   bed of death with the black pall -- but is finally restored to security
   and happiness with her lover Valancourt, after the clearing-up of a secret
   which seemed for a time to involve her birth in mystery. Clearly, this is
   only familiar material re-worked; but it is so well re-worked that Udolpho
   will always be a classic. Mrs. Radcliffe's characters are puppets, but
   they are less markedly so than those of her forerunners. And in
   atmospheric creation she stands preeminent among those of her time.

   Of Mrs. Radcliffe's countless imitators, the American novelist Charles
   Brockden Brown stands the closest in spirit and method. Like her, he
   injured his creations by natural explanations; but also like her, he had
   an uncanny atmospheric power which gives his horrors a frightful vitality
   as long as they remain unexplained. He differed from her in contemptuously
   discarding the external Gothic paraphernalia and properties and choosing
   modern American scenes for his Mysteries; but this repudiation did not
   extend to the Gothic spirit and type of incident. Brown's novels involve
   some memorably frightful scenes, and excel even Mrs. Radcliffe's in
   describing the operations of the perturbed mind. Edgar Hunily starts with
   a sleep-walker digging a grave, but is later impaired by touches of
   Godwinian didacticism. Ormond involves a member of a sinister secret
   brotherhood. That and Arthur Mervyn both describe the plague of yellow
   fever, which the author had witnessed in Philadelphia and New York. But
   Brown's most famous book is Wieland; or, the Transformation (1798), in
   which a Pennsylvania German, engulfed by a wave of religious fanaticism,
   hears "voices" and slays his wife and children as a sacrifice. His sister
   Clara, who tells the story, narrowly escapes. The scene, laid at the
   woodland estate of Mittingen on the Schuylkill's remote reaches, is drawn
   with extreme vividness; and the terrors of Clara, beset by spectral tones,
   gathering fears, and the sound of strange footsteps in the lonely house,
   are all shaped with truly artistic force. In the end a lame ventriloquial
   explanation is offered, but the atmosphere is genuine while it lasts.
   Carwin, the malign ventriloquist, is a typical villain of the Manfred or
   Montoni type.

                         IV. The Apex Of Gothic Romance

   Horror in literature attains a new malignity in the work of Matthew
   Gregory Lewis (1773-1818), whose novel The Monk (1796) achieved marvelous
   popularity and earned him the nickname "Monk" Lewis. This young author,
   educated in Germany and saturated with a body of wild Teuton lore unknown
   to Mrs. Radcliffe, turned to terror in forms more violent than his gentle
   predecessor had ever dared to think of; and produced as a result a
   masterpiece of active nightmare whose general Gothic cast is spiced with
   added stores of ghoulishness. The story is one of a Spanish monk,
   Ambrosio, who from a state of over-proud virtue is tempted to the very
   nadir of evil by a fiend in the guise of the maiden Matilda; and who is
   finally, when awaiting death at the Inquisition's hands, induced to
   purchase escape at the price of his soul from the Devil, because he deems
   both body and soul already lost. Forthwith the mocking Fiend snatches him
   to a lonely place, tells him he has sold his soul in vain since both
   pardon and a chance for salvation were approaching at the moment of his
   hideous bargain, and completes the sardonic betrayal by rebuking him for
   his unnatural crimes, and casting his body down a precipice whilst his
   soul is borne off for ever to perdition. The novel contains some appalling
   descriptions such as the incantation in the vaults beneath the convent
   cemetery, the burning of the convent, and the final end of the wretched
   abbot. In the sub-plot where the Marquis de las Cisternas meets the
   spectre of his erring ancestress, The Bleeding Nun, there are many
   enormously potent strokes; notably the visit of the animated corpse to the
   Marquis's bedside, and the cabalistic ritual whereby the Wandering Jew
   helps him to fathom and banish his dead tormentor. Nevertheless The Monk
   drags sadly when read as a whole. It is too long and too diffuse, and much
   of its potency is marred by flippancy and by an awkwardly excessive
   reaction against those canons of decorum which Lewis at first despised as
   prudish. One great thing may be said of the author; that he never ruined
   his ghostly visions with a natural explanation. He succeeded in breaking
   up the Radcliffian tradition and expanding the field of the Gothic novel.
   Lewis wrote much more than The Monk. His drama, The Castle Spectre, was
   produced in 1798, and he later found time to pen other fictions in ballad
   form -- Tales of Terror (1799), The Tales of Wonder (1801), and a
   succession of translations from the German. Gothic romances, both English
   and German, now appeared in multitudinous and mediocre profusion. Most of
   them were merely ridiculous in the light of mature taste, and Miss
   Austen's famous satire Northanger Abbey was by no means an unmerited
   rebuke to a school which had sunk far toward absurdity. This particular
   school was petering out, but before its final subordination there arose
   its last and greatest figure in the person of Charles Robert Maturin
   (1782-1824), an obscure and eccentric Irish clergyman. Out of an ample
   body of miscellaneous writing which includes one confused Radcliffian
   imitation called The Fatal Revenge; or, the Family of Montorio (1807),
   Maturin at length envolved the vivid horror-masterpiece of Melmoth, the
   Wanderer (1820), in which the Gothic tale climbed to altitudes of sheer
   spiritual fright which it had never known before.

   Melmoth is the tale of an Irish Gentleman who, in the seventeenth century,
   obtained a preternaturally extended life from the Devil at the price of
   his soul. If he can persuade another to take the bargain off his hands,
   and assume his existing state, he can be saved; but this he can never
   manage to effect, no matter how assiduously he haunts those whom despair
   has made reckless and frantic. The framework of the story is very clumsy;
   involving tedious length, digressive episodes, narratives within
   narratives, and labored dovetailing and coincidence; but at various points
   in the endless rambling there is felt a pulse of power undiscoverable in
   any previous work of this kind -- a kinship to the essential truth of
   human nature, an understanding of the profoundest sources of actual cosmic
   fear, and a white heat of sympathetic passion on the writer's part which
   makes the book a true document of aesthetic self-expression rather than a
   mere clever compound of artifice. No unbiased reader can doubt that with
   Melmoth an enormous stride in the evolution of the horror-tale is
   represented. Fear is taken out of the realm of the conventional and
   exalted into a hideous cloud over mankind's very destiny. Maturin's
   shudders, the work of one capable of shuddering himself, are of the sort
   that convince. Mrs. Radcliffe and Lewis are fair game for the parodist,
   but it would be difficult to find a false note in the feverishly
   intensified action and high atmospheric tension of the Irishman whose less
   sophisticated emotions and strain of Celtic mysticism gave him the finest
   possible natural equipment for his task. Without a doubt Maturin is a man
   of authentic genius, and he was so recognized by Balzac, who grouped
   Melmoth with Moliere's Don Juan, Gothe's Faust, and Byron's Manfred as the
   supreme allegorical figures of modern European literature, and wrote a
   whimsical piece called Melmoth Reconciled, in which the Wanderer succeeds
   in passing his infernal bargain on to a Parisian bank defaulter, who in
   turn hands it along a chain of victims until a reveling gambler dies with
   it in his possession, and by his damnation ends the curse. Scott,
   Rossetti, Thackeray and Baudelaire are the other titans who gave Maturin
   their unqualified admiration, and there is much significance in the fact
   that Oscar Wilde, after his disgrace and exile, chose for his last days in
   Paris the assumed name of "Sebastian Melmoth."

   Melmoth contains scenes which even now have not lost their power to evoke
   dread. It begins with a deathbed -- an old miser is dying of sheer fright
   because of something he has seen, coupled with a manuscript he has read
   and a family portrait which hangs in an obscure closet of his centuried
   home in County Wicklow. He sends to Trinity College, Dublin, for his
   nephew John; and the latter upon arriving notes many uncanny things. The
   eyes of the portrait in the closet glow horribly, and twice a figure
   strangely resembling the portrait appears momentarily at the door. Dread
   hangs over that house of the Melmoths, one of whose ancestors, "J.
   Melmoth, 1646," the portrait represents. The dying miser declares that
   this man -- at a date slightly before 1800 -- is alive. Finally the miser
   dies, and the nephew is told in the will to destroy both the portrait and
   a manuscript to be found in a certain drawer. Reading the manuscript,
   which was written late in the seventeenth century by an Englishman named
   Stanton, young John learns of a terrible incident in Spain in 1677, when
   the writer met a horrible fellow-countryman and was told of how he had
   stared to death a priest who tried to denounce him as one filled with
   fearsome evil. Later, after meeting the man again in London, Stanton is
   cast into a madhouse and visited by the stranger, whose approach is
   heralded by spectral music and whose eyes have a more than mortal glare.
   Melmoth the Wanderer -- for such is the malign visitor -- offers the
   captive freedom if he will take over his bargain with the Devil; but like
   all others whom Melmoth has approached, Stanton is proof against
   temptation. Melmoth's description of the horrors of a life in a madhouse,
   used to tempt Stanton, is one of the most potent passages of the book.
   Stanton is at length liberated, and spends the rest of his life tracking
   down Melmoth, whose family and ancestral abode he discovers. With the
   family he leaves the manuscript, which by young John's time is badly
   ruinous and fragmentary. John destroys both portrait and manuscript, but
   in sleep is visited by his horrible ancestor, who leaves a black and blue
   mark on his wrist.

   Young John soon afterward receives as a visitor a shipwrecked Spaniard,
   Alonzo de Moncada, who has escaped from compulsory monasticism and from
   the perils of the Inquisition. He has suffered horribly -- and the
   descriptions of his experiences under torment and in the vaults through
   which he once essays escape are classic -- but had the strength to resist
   Melmoth the Wanderer when approached at his darkest hour in prison. At the
   house of a Jew who sheltered him after his escape he discovers a wealth of
   manuscript relating other exploits of Melmoth, including his wooing of an
   Indian island maiden, Immalee, who later comes into her birthright in
   Spain and is known as Donna Isidora; and of his horrible marriage to her
   by the corpse of a dead anchorite at midnight in the ruined chapel of a
   shunned and abhorred monastery. Moncada's narrative to young John takes up
   the bulk of Maturin's four-volume book; this disproportion being
   considered one of the chief technical faults of the composition.

   At last the colloquies of John and Moncada are interrupted by the entrance
   of Melmoth the Wanderer himself, his piercing eyes now fading, and
   decrepitude swiftly overtaking him. The term of his bargain has approached
   its end, and he has come home after a century and a half to meet his fate.
   Warning all others from the room, no matter what sounds they may hear in
   the night, he awaits the end alone. Young John and Moncada hear frightful
   ululations, but do not intrude till silence comes toward morning. They
   then find the room empty. Clayey footprints lead out a rear door to a
   cliff overlooking the sea, and near the edge of the precipice is a track
   indicating the forcible dragging of some heavy body. The Wanderer's scarf
   is found on a crag some distance below the brink, but nothing further is
   ever seen or heard of him.

   Such is the story, and none can fail to notice the difference between this
   modulated, suggestive, and artistically moulded horror and -- to use the
   words of Professor George Saintsbury -- "the artful but rather jejune
   rationalism of Mrs. Radcliffe, and the too often puerile extravagance, the
   bad taste, and the sometimes slipshod style of Lewis." Maturin's style in
   itself deserves particular praise, for its forcible directness and
   vitality lift it altogether above the pompous artificialities of which his
   predecessors are guilty. Professor Edith Birkhead, in her history of the
   Gothic novel, justly observes that "with all his faults Maturin was the
   greatest as well as the last of the Goths." Melmoth was widely read and
   eventually dramatized, but its late date in the evolution of the Gothic
   tale deprived it of the tumultuous popularity of Udolpho and The Monk.

                       V. The Aftermath Of Gothic Fiction

   Meanwhile other hands had not been idle, so that above the dreary plethora
   of trash like Marquis von Grosse's Horrid Mysteries (1796), Mrs. Roche's
   Children of the Abbey (1798), Mrs. Dacre's Zofloya; or, the Moor (1806),
   and the poet Shelley's schoolboy effusions Zastro (1810) and St. Irvine
   (1811) (both imitations of Zofloya) there arose many memorable weird works
   both in English and German. Classic in merit, and markedly different from
   its fellows because of its foundation in the Oriental tale rather than the
   Walpolesque Gothic novel, is the celebrated History of the Caliph Vathek
   by the wealthy dilettante William Beckford, first written in the French
   language but published in an English translation before the appearance of
   the original. Eastern tales, introduced to European literature early in
   the eighteenth century through Galland's French translation of the
   inexhaustibly opulent Arabian Nights, had become a reigning fashion; being
   used both for allegory and for amusement. The sly humour which only the
   Eastern mind knows how to mix with weirdness had captivated a
   sophisticated generation, till Bagdad and Damascus names became as freely
   strewn through popular literature as dashing Italian and Spanish ones were
   soon to be. Beckford, well read in Eastern romance, caught the atmosphere
   with unusual receptivity; and in his fantastic volume reflected very
   potently the haughty luxury, sly disillusion, bland cruelty, urbane
   treachery, and shadowy spectral horror of the Saracen spirit. His
   seasoning of the ridiculous seldom mars the force of his sinister theme,
   and the tale marches onward with a phantasmagoric pomp in which the
   laughter is that of skeletons feasting under arabesque domes. Vathek is a
   tale of the grandson of the Caliph Haroun, who, tormented by that ambition
   for super-terrestrial power, pleasure and learning which animates the
   average Gothic villain or Byronic hero (essentially cognate types), is
   lured by an evil genius to seek the subterranean throne of the mighty and
   fabulous pre-Adamite sultans in the fiery halls of Eblis, the Mahometan
   Devil. The descriptions of Vathek's palaces and diversions, of his
   scheming sorceress-mother Carathis and her witch-tower with the fifty
   one-eyed negresses, of his pilgrimage to the haunted ruins of Istakhar
   (Persepolis) and of the impish bride Nouronihar whom he treacherously
   acquired on the way, of Istakhar's primordial towers and terraces in the
   burning moonlight of the waste, and of the terrible Cyclopean halls of
   Eblis, where, lured by glittering promises, each victim is compelled to
   wander in anguish for ever, his right hand upon his blazingly ignited and
   eternally burning heart, are triumphs of weird colouring which raise the
   book to a permaneat place in English letters. No less notable are the
   three Episodes of Vathek, intended for insertion in the tale as narratives
   of Vathek's fellow-victims in Eblis' infernal halls, which remained
   unpublished throughout the author's lifetime and were discovered as
   recently as 1909 by the scholar Lewis Melville whilst collecting material
   for his Life and Letters of William Beckford. Beckford, however, lacks the
   essential mysticism which marks the acutest form of the weird; so that his
   tales have a certain knowing Latin hardness and clearness preclusive of
   sheer panic fright.

   But Beckford remained alone in his devotion to the Orient. Other writers,
   closer to the Gothic tradition and to European life in general, were
   content to follow more faithfully in the lead of Walpole. Among the
   countless producers of terror-literature in these times may be mentioned
   the Utopian economic theorist William Godwin, who followed his famous but
   non-supernatural Caleb Williams (1794) with the intendedly weird St. Leon
   (1799), in which the theme of the elixir of life, as developed by the
   imaginary secret order of "Rosicrucians," is handled with ingeniousness if
   not with atmospheric convincingness. This element of Rosicrucianism,
   fostered by a wave of popular magical interest exemplified in the vogue of
   the charlatan Cagliostro and the publication of Francis Barrett's The
   Magus (1801), a curious and compendious treatise on occult principles and
   ceremonies, of which a reprint was made as lately as 1896, figures in
   Bulwer-Lytton and in many late Gothic novels, especially that remote and
   enfeebled posterity which straggled far down into the nineteenth century
   and was represented by George W.M. Reynold's Faust and the Demon and
   Wagner the Wehr-Wolf. Caleb Williams, though non-supernatural, has many
   authentic touches of terror. It is the tale of a servant persecuted by a
   master whom he has found guilty of murder, and displays an invention and
   skill which have kept it alive in a fashion to this day. It was dramatized
   as The Iron Chest, and in that form was almost equally celebrated. Godwin,
   however, was too much the conscious teacher and prosaic man of thought to
   create a genuine weird masterpiece.

   His daughter, the wife of Shelley, was much more successful; and her
   inimitable Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus (1817) is one of the
   horror-classics of all time. Composed in competition with her husband,
   Lord Byron, and Dr. John William Polidori in an effort to prove supremacy
   in horror-making, Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein was the only one of the
   rival narratives to be brought to an elaborate completion; and criticism
   has failed to prove that the best parts are due to Shelley rather than to
   her. The novel, somewhat tinged but scarcely marred by moral didacticism,
   tells of the artificial human being moulded from charnel fragments by
   Victor Frankenstein, a young Swiss medical student. Created by its
   designer "in the mad pride of intellectuality," the monster possesses full
   intelligence but owns a hideously loathsome form. It is rejected by
   mankind, becomes embittered, and at length begins the successive murder of
   all whom Frankenstein loves best, friends and family. It demands that
   Frankenstein create a wife for it; and when the student finally refuses in
   horror lest the world be populated with such monsters, it departs with a
   hideous threat "to be with him on his wedding night." Upon that night the
   bride is strangled, and from that time on Frankenstein hunts down the
   monster, even into the wastes of the Arctic. In the end, whilst seeking
   shelter on the ship of the man who tells the story, Frankenstein himself
   is killed by the shocking object of his search and creation of his
   presumptuous pride. Some of the scenes in Frankenstein are unforgettable,
   as when the newly animated monster enters its creator's room, parts the
   curtains of his bed, and gazes at him in the yellow moonlight with watery
   eyes -- "if eyes they may be called." Mrs. Shelley wrote other novels,
   including the fairly notable Last Man; but never duplicated the success of
   her first effort. It has the true touch of cosmic fear, no matter how much
   the movement may lag in places. Dr. Polidori developed his competing idea
   as a long short story, The Vampyre; in which we behold a suave villain of
   the true Gothic or Byronic type, and encounter some excellent passages of
   stark fright, including a terrible nocturnal experience in a shunned
   Grecian wood.

   In this same period Sir Walter Scott frequently concerned himself with the
   weird, weaving it into many of his novels and poems, and sometimes
   producing such independent bits of narration as The Tapestried Chamber or
   Wandering Willie's Tale in Redgauntlet, in the latter of which the force
   of the spectral and the diabolic is enhanced by a grotesque homeliness of
   speech and atmosphere. In 1830 Scott published his Letters on Demonology
   and Witchcraft, which still forms one of our best compendia of European
   witch-lore. Washington Irving is another famous figure not unconnected
   with the weird; for though most of his ghosts are too whimsical and
   humorous to form genuinely spectral literature, a distinct inclination in
   this direction is to be noted in many of his productions. The German
   Student in Tales of a Traveler (1824) is a slyly concise and effective
   presentation of the old legend of the dead bride, whilst woven into the
   cosmic tissue of The Money Diggers in the same volume is more than one
   hint of piratical apparitions in the realms which Captain Kidd once
   roamed. Thomas Moore also joined the ranks of the macabre artists in the
   poem Alciphron, which he later elaborated into the prose novel of The
   Epicurean (1827). Though merely relating the adventures of a young
   Athenian duped by the artifice of cunning Egyptian priests, Moore manages
   to infuse much genuine horror into his account of subterranean frights and
   wonders beneath the primordial temples of Memphis. De Quincey more than
   once revels in grotesque and arabesque terrors, though with a
   desultoriness and learned pomp which deny him the rank of specialist.

   This era likewise saw the rise of William Harrison Ainsworth, whose
   romantic novels teem with the eerie and the gruesome. Capt. Marryat,
   besides writing such short tales as The Werewolf, made a memorable
   contribution in The Phantom Ship (1839), founded on the legend of the
   Flying Dutchman, whose spectral and accursed vessel sails for ever near
   the Cape of Good Hope. Dickens now rises with occasional weird bits like
   The Signalman, a tale of ghastly warning conforming to a very common
   pattern and touched with a verisimilitude which allied it as much with the
   coming psychological school as with the dying Gothic school. At this time
   a wave of interest in spiritualistic charlatanry, mediumism, Hindoo
   theosophy, and such matters, much like that of the present day, was
   flourishing; so that the number of weird tales with a "Psychic" or
   pseudo-scientific basis became very considerable. For a number of these
   the prolific and popular Edward Bulwer-Lytton was responsible; and despite
   the large doses of turgid rhetoric and empty romanticism in his products,
   his success in the weaving of a certain kind of bizarre charm cannot be
   denied.

   The House and the Brain, which hints of Rosicrucianism and at a malign and
   deathless figure perhaps suggested by Louis XV's mysterious courtier St.
   Germain, yet survives as one of the best short haunted-house tales ever
   written. The novel Zanoni (1842) contains similar elements more
   elaborately handled, and introduces a vast unknown sphere of being
   pressing on our own world and guarded by a horrible "Dweller of the
   Threshold" who haunts those who try to enter and fail. Here we have a
   benign brotherhood kept alive from age to age till finally reduced to a
   single member, and as a hero an ancient Chaldaean sorcerer surviving in
   the pristine bloom of youth to perish on the guillotine of the French
   Revolution. Though full of the conventional spirit of romance, marred by a
   ponderous network of symbolic and didactic meanings, and left unconvincing
   through lack of perfect atmospheric realization of the situations hinging
   on the spectral world, Zanoni is really an excellent performance as a
   romantic novel; and can be read with genuine interest by the not too
   sophisticated reader. It is amusing to note that in describing an
   attempted initiation into the ancient brotherhood the author cannot escape
   using the stock Gothic castle of Walpolian lineage.

   In A Strange Story (1862) Bulwer-Lytton shows a marked improvement in the
   creation of weird images and moods. The novel, despite enormous length, a
   highly artificial plot bolstered up by opportune coincidences, and an
   atmosphere of homiletic pseudo-science designed to please the
   matter-of-fact and purposeful Victorian reader, is exceedingly effective
   as a narrative; evoking instantaneous and unflagging interest, and
   furnishing many potent -- if somewhat melodramatic -- tableaux and
   climaxes. Again we have the mysterious user of life's elixir in the person
   of the soulless magician Margrave, whose dark exploits stand out with
   dramatic vividness against the modern background of a quiet English town
   and of the Australian bush; and again we have shadowy intimations of a
   vast spectral world of the unknown in the very air about us -- this time
   handled with much greater power and vitality than in Zanoni. One of the
   two great incantation passages, where the hero is driven by a luminous
   evil spirit to rise at night in his sleep, take a strange Egyptian wand,
   and evoke nameless presences in the haunted and mausoleum-facing pavilion
   of a famous Renaissance alchemist, truly stands among the major terror
   scenes of literature. Just enough is suggested, and just little enough is
   told. Unknown words are twice dictated to the sleep-walker, and as he
   repeats them the ground trembles, and all the dogs of the countryside
   begin to bay at half-seen amorphous shadows that stalk athwart the
   moonlight. When a third set of unknown words is prompted, the
   sleep-walker's spirit suddenly rebels at uttering them, as if the soul
   could recognize ultimate abysmal horrors concealed from the mind; and at
   last an apparition of an absent sweetheart and good angel breaks the
   malign spell. This fragment well illustrates how far Lord Lytton was
   capable of progressing beyond his usual pomp and stock romance toward that
   crystalline essence of artistic fear which belongs to the domain of
   poetry. In describing certain details of incantations, Lytton was greatly
   indebted to his amusingly serious occult studies, in the course of which
   he came in touch with that odd French scholar and cabalist Alphonse Louis
   Constant ("Eliphas Levy"), who claimed to possess the secrets of ancient
   magic, and to have evoked the spectre of the old Grecian wizard Apollonius
   of Tyana, who lived in Nero's times.

   The romantic, semi-Gothic, quasi-moral tradition here represented was
   carried far down the nineteenth century by such authors as Joseph Sheridan
   LeFanu, Wilkie Collins, the late Sir H. Rider Haggard (whose She is really
   remarkably good), Sir A. Conan Doyle, H. G. Wells, and Robert Louis
   Stevenson -- the latter of whom, despite an atrocious tendency toward
   jaunty mannerisms, created permanent classics in Markheim, The Body
   Snatcher, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Indeed, we may say that this school
   still survives; for to it clearly belong such of our contemporary
   horror-tales as specialise in events rather than atmospheric details,
   address the intellect rather than a malign tensity or psychological
   verisimilitude, and take a definite stand in sympathy with mankind and its
   welfare. It has its undeniable strength, and because of its "human
   element" commands a wider audience than does the sheer artistic nightmare.
   If not quite so potent as the latter, it is because a diluted product can
   never achieve the intensity of a concentrated essence.

   Quite alone both as a novel and as a piece of terror-literature stands the
   famous Wuthering Heights (1847) by Emily Bronte, with its mad vistas of
   bleak, windswept Yorkshire moors and the violent, distorted lives they
   foster. Though primarily a tale of life, and of human passions in agony
   and conflict, its epically cosmic setting affords room for horror of the
   most spiritual sort. Heathcliff, the modified Byronic villain-hero, is a
   strange dark waif found in the streets as a small child and speaking only
   a strange gibberish till adopted by the family he ultimately ruins. That
   he is in truth a diabolic spirit rather than a human being is more than
   once suggested, and the unreal is further approached in the experience of
   the visitor who encounters a plaintive child-ghost at a bough-brushed
   upper window. Between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw is a tie deeper
   and more terrible than human love. After her death he twice disturbs her
   grave, and is haunted by an impalpable presence which can be nothing less
   than her spirit. The spirit enters his life more and more, and at last he
   becomes confident of some imminent mystical reunion. He says he feels a
   strange change approaching, and ceases to take nourishment. At night he
   either walks abroad or opens the casement by his bed. When he dies the
   casement is still swinging open to the pouring rain, and a queer smile
   pervades the stiffened face. They bury him in a grave beside the mound he
   has haunted for eighteen years, and small shepherd boys say that he yet
   walks with his Catherine in the churchyard and on the moor when it rains.
   Their faces, too, are sometimes seen on rainy nights behind that upper
   casement at Wuthering Heights. Miss Bronte's eerie terror is no mere
   Gothic echoe, but a tense expression of man's shuddering reaction to the
   unknown. In this respect, Wuthering Heights becomes the symbol of a
   literary transition, and marks the growth of a new and sounder school.

                    VI. Spectral Literature On The Continent

   On the continent literary horror fared well. The celebrated short tales
   and novels of Ernst Theodor Wihelm Hoffmann (1776-1822) are a by-word for
   mellowness of background and maturity of form, though they incline to
   levity and extravagance, and lack the exalted moments of stark, breathless
   terror which a less sophisticated writer might have achieved. Generally
   they convey the grotesque rather than the terrible. Most artistic of all
   the continental weird tales is the German classic Undine (1814), by
   Friedrich Heinrich Karl, Baron de la Motte Fouque. In this story of a
   water-spirit who married a mortal and gained a human soul there is a
   delicate fineness of craftsmanship which makes it notable in any
   department of literature, and an easy naturalness which places it close to
   the genuine folk-myth. It is, in fact, derived from a tale told by the
   Renaissance physician and alchemist Paracelsus in his Treatise on
   Elemental Sprites.

   Undine, daughter of a powerful water-prince, was exchanged by her father
   as a small child for a fisherman's daughter, in order that she might
   acquire a soul by wedding a human being. Meeting the noble youth Huldbrand
   at the cottage of her fosterfather by the sea at the edge of a haunted
   wood, she soon marries him, and accompanies him to his ancestral castle of
   Ringstetten. Huldbrand, however, eventually wearies of his wife's
   supernatural affiliations, and especially of the appearances of her uncle,
   the malicious woodland waterfall-spirit Kuhleborn; a weariness increased
   by his growing affection for Bertalda, who turns out to be the fisherman's
   child for whom Undine was changed. At length, on a voyage down the Danube,
   he is provoked by some innocent act of his devoted wife to utter the angry
   words which consign her back to her supernatural element; from which she
   can, by the laws of her species, return only once -- to kill him, whether
   she will or no, if ever he prove unfaithful to her memory. Later, when
   Huldbrand is about to be married to Bertalda, Undine returns for her sad
   duty, and bears his life away in tears. When he is buried among his
   fathers in the village churchyard a veiled, snow-white female figure
   appears among the mourners, but after the prayer is seen no more. In her
   place is seen a little silver spring, which murmurs its way almost
   completely around the new grave, and empties into a neighboring lake. The
   villagers show it to this day, and say that Undine and her Huldbrand are
   thus united in death. Many passages and atmospheric touches in this tale
   reveal Fouque as an accomplished artist in the field of the macabre;
   especially the descriptions of the haunted wood with its gigantic
   snow-white man and various unnamed terrors, which occur early in the
   narrative.

   Not so well known as Undine, but remarkable for its convincing realism and
   freedom from Gothic stock devices, is the Amber Witch of Wilhelm Meinhold,
   another product of the German fantastic genius of the earlier nineteenth
   century. This tale, which is laid in the time of the Thirty Years' War,
   purports to be a clergyman's manuscript found in an old church at Coserow,
   and centres round the writer's daughter, Maria Schweidler, who is wrongly
   accused of witchcraft. She has found a deposit of amber which she keeps
   secret for various reasons, and the unexplained wealth obtained from this
   lends colour to the accusation; an accusation instigated by the malice of
   the wolf-hunting nobleman Wittich Appelmann, who has vainly pursued her
   with ignoble designs. The deeds of a real witch, who afterward comes to a
   horrible supernatural end in prison, are glibly imputed to the hapless
   Maria; and after a typical witchcraft trial with forced confessions under
   torture she is about to be burned at the stake when saved just in time by
   her lover, a noble youth from a neighboring district. Meinhold's great
   strength is in his air of casual and realistic verisimilitude, which
   intensifies our suspense and sense of the unseen by half persuading us
   that the menacing events must somehow be either the truth or very close to
   the truth. Indeed, so thorough is this realism that a popular magazine
   once published the main points of The Amber Witch as an actual occurrence
   of the seventeenth century!

   In the present generation German horror-fiction is most notably
   represented by Hanns Heinz Ewers, who brings to bear on his dark
   conceptions an effective knowledge of modern psychology. Novels like The
   Sorcerer's Apprentice and Alrune, and short stories like The Spider,
   contain distinctive qualities which raise them to a classic level.

   But France as well as Germany has been active in the realm of weirdness.
   Victor Hugo, in such tales as Hans of Iceland, and Balzac, in The Wild
   Ass's Skin, Seraphita, and Louis Lambert, both employ supernaturalism to a
   greater or less extent; though generally only as a means to some more
   human end, and without the sincere and daemonic intensity which
   characterizes the born artist in shadows. It is in Theophile Gautier that
   we first seem to find an authentic French sense of the unreal world, and
   here there appears a spectral mystery which, though not continuously used,
   is recognizable at once as something alike genuine and profound. Short
   tales like Avatar, The Foot of the Mummy, and Clarimonde display glimpses
   of forbidden vistas that allure, tantalize, and sometime horrify; whilst
   the Egyptian visions evoked in One of Cleopatra's Nights are of the
   keenest and most expressive potency. Gautier captured the inmost soul of
   aeon-weighted Egypt, with its cryptic life and Cyclopean architecture, and
   uttered once and for all the eternal horror of its nether world of
   catacombs, where to the end of time millions of stiff, spiced corpses will
   stare up in the blackness with glassy eyes, awaiting some awesome and
   unrelatable summons. Gustave Flaubert ably continued the tradition of
   Gautier in orgies of poetic phantasy like The Temptation of St. Anthony,
   and but for a strong realistic bias might have been an arch-weaver of
   tapestried terrors. Later on we see the stream divide, producing strange
   poets and fantaisistes of the symbolic and decadent schools whose dark
   interests really centre more in abnormalities of human thought and
   instinct than in the actual supernatural, and subtle story-tellers whose
   thrills are quite directly derived from the night-black wells of cosmic
   unreality. Of the former class of "artists in sin" the illustrious poet
   Baudelaire, influenced vastly by Poe, is the supreme type; whilst the
   psychological novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans, a true child of the
   eighteen-nineties, is at once the summation and finale. The latter and
   purely narrative class is continued by Prosper Merimee, whose Venus of
   Ille presents in terse and convincing prose the same ancient statue-bride
   theme which Thomas Moore cast in ballad form in The Ring.

   The horror-tales of the powerful and cynical Guy de Maupassant, written as
   his final madness gradually overtook him, present individualities of their
   own; being rather the morbid outpourings of a realistic mind in a
   pathological state than the healthy imaginative products of a vision
   naturally disposed toward phantasy and sensitive to the normal illusions
   of the unseen. Nevertheless they are of the keenest interest and
   poignancy; suggesting with marvelous force the imminence of nameless
   terrors, and the relentless dogging of an ill-starred individual by
   hideous and menacing representatives of the outer blackness. Of these
   stories The Horla is generally regarded as the masterpiece. Relating the
   advent to France of an invisible being who lives on water and milk, sways
   the minds of others, and seems to be the vanguard of a horde of
   extra-terrestrial organisms arrived on earth to subjugate and overwhelm
   mankind, this tense narrative is perhaps without a peer in its particular
   department; notwithstanding its indebtedness to a tale by the American
   Fitz-James O'Brien for details in describing the actual presence of the
   unseen monster. Other potently dark creations of de Maupassant are Who
   Knows?, The Spectre, He, The Diary of a Madman, The White Wolf, On the
   River, and the grisly verses entitled Horror.

   The collaborators Erckmann-Chatrian enriched French literature with many
   spectral fancies like The Man-Wolf, in which a transmitted curse works
   toward its end in a traditional Gothic-castle setting. Their power of
   creating a shuddering midnight atmosphere was tremendous despite a
   tendency toward natural explanations and scientific wonders; and few short
   tales contain greater horror than The Invisible Eye, where a malignant old
   hag weaves nocturnal hypnotic spells which induce the successive occupants
   of a certain inn chamber to hang themselves on a cross-beam. The Owl's Ear
   and The Waters of Death are full of engulfing darkness and mystery, the
   latter embodying the familiar over-grown-spider theme so frequently
   employed by weird fictionists. Villiers de l'Isle Adam likewise followed
   the macabre school; his Torture by Hope, the tale of a stake-condemned
   prisoner permitted to escape in order to feel the pangs of recapture,
   being held by some to constitute the most harrowing short story in
   literature. This type, however, is less a part of the weird tradition than
   a class peculiar to itself -- the so-called conte cruel, in which the
   wrenching of the emotions is accomplished through dramatic tantalizations,
   frustrations, and gruesome physical horrors. Almost wholly devoted to this
   form is the living writer Maurice Level, whose very brief episodes have
   lent themselves so readily to theatrical adaptation in the "thrillers" of
   the Grand Guignol. As a matter of fact, the French genius is more
   naturally suited to this dark realism than to the suggestion of the
   unseen; since the latter process requires, for its best and most
   sympathetic development on a large scale, the inherent mysticism of the
   Northern mind.

   A very flourishing, though till recently quite hidden, branch of weird
   literature is that of the Jews, kept alive and nourished in obscurity by
   the sombre heritage of early Eastern magic, apocalyptic literature, and
   cabbalism. The Semitic mind, like the Celtic and Teutonic, seems to
   possess marked mystical inclinations; and the wealth of underground
   horror-lore surviving in ghettoes and synagogues must be much more
   considerable than is generally imagined. Cabbalism itself, so prominent
   during the Middle Ages, is a system of philosophy explaining the universe
   as emanations of the Deity, and involving the existence of strange
   spiritual realms and beings apart from the visible world of which dark
   glimpses may be obtained through certain secret incantations. Its ritual
   is bound up with mystical interpretations of the Old Testament, and
   attributes an esoteric significance to each letter of the Hebrew alphabet
   -- a circumstance which has imparted to Hebrew letters a sort of spectral
   glamour and potency in the popular literature of magic. Jewish folklore
   has preserved much of the terror and mystery of the past, and when more
   thoroughly studied is likely to exert considerable influence on weird
   fiction. The best examples of its literary use so far are the German novel
   The Golem, by Gustave Meyrink, and the drama The Dybbuk, by the Jewish
   writer using the pseudonym "Ansky." The former, with its haunting shadowy
   suggestions of marvels and horrors just beyond reach, is laid in Prague,
   and describes with singular mastery that city's ancient ghetto with its
   spectral, peaked gables. The name is derived from a fabulous artificial
   giant supposed to be made and animated by mediaeval rabbis according to a
   certain cryptic formula. The Dyhbuk, translated and produced in America in
   1925, and more recently produced as an opera, describes with singular
   power the possession of a living body by the evil soul of a dead man. Both
   golems and dyhbuks are fixed types, and serve as frequent ingredients of
   later Jewish tradition.

                              VII. Edgar Allan Poe

   In the eighteen-thirties occurred a literary dawn directly affecting not
   only the history of the weird tale, but that of short fiction as a whole;
   and indirectly moulding the trends and fortunes of a great European
   aesthetic school. It is our good fortune as Americans to be able to claim
   that dawn as our own, for it came in the person of our most illustrious
   and unfortunate fellow-countryman Edgar Allan Poe. Poe's fame has been
   subject to curious undulations, and it is now a fashion amongst the
   "advanced intelligentsia" to minimize his importance both as an artist and
   as an influence; but it would be hard for any mature and reflective critic
   to deny the tremendous value of his work and the persuasive potency of his
   mind as an opener of artistic vistas. True, his type of outlook may have
   been anticipated; but it was he who first realized its possibilities and
   gave it supreme form and systematic expression. True also, that subsequent
   writers may have produced greater single tales than his; but again we must
   comprehend that it was only he who taught them by example and precept the
   art which they, having the way cleared for them and given an explicit
   guide, were perhaps able to carry to greater lengths. Whatever his
   limitations, Poe did that which no one else ever did or could have done;
   and to him we owe the modern horror-story in its final and perfected
   state.

   Before Poe the bulk of weird writers had worked largely in the dark;
   without an understanding of the psychological basis of the horror appeal,
   and hampered by more or less of conformity to certain empty literary
   conventions such as the happy ending, virtue rewarded, and in general a
   hollow moral didacticism, acceptance of popular standards and values, and
   striving of the author to obtrude his own emotions into the story and take
   sides with the partisans of the majority's artificial ideas. Poe, on the
   other hand, perceived the essential impersonality of the real artist; and
   knew that the function of creative fiction is merely to express and
   interpret events and sensations as they are, regardless of how they tend
   or what they prove -- good or evil, attractive or repulsive, stimulating
   or depressing, with the author always acting as a vivid and detached
   chronicler rather than as a teacher, sympathizer, or vendor of opinion. He
   saw clearly that all phases of life and thought are equally eligible as a
   subject matter for the artist, and being inclined by temperament to
   strangeness and gloom, decided to be the interpreter of those powerful
   feelings and frequent happenings which attend pain rather than pleasure,
   decay rather than growth, terror rather than tranquility, and which are
   fundamentally either adverse or indifferent to the tastes and traditional
   outward sentiments of mankind, and to the health, sanity, and normal
   expansive welfare of the species.

   Poe's spectres thus acquired a convincing malignity possessed by none of
   their predecessors, and established a new standard of realism in the
   annals of literary horror. The impersonal and artistic intent, moreover,
   was aided by a scientific attitude not often found before; whereby Poe
   studied the human mind rather than the usages of Gothic fiction, and
   worked with an analytical knowledge of terror's true sources which doubled
   the force of his narratives and emancipated him from all the absurdities
   inherent in merely conventional shudder-coining. This example having been
   set, later authors were naturally forced to conform to it in order to
   compete at all; so that in this way a definite change begin to affect the
   main stream of macabre writing. Poe, too, set a fashion in consummate
   craftsmanship; and although today some of his own work seems slightly
   melodramatic and unsophisticated, we can constantly trace his influence in
   such things as the maintenance of a single mood and achievement of a
   single impression in a tale, and the rigorous paring down of incidents to
   such as have a direct bearing on the plot and will figure prominently in
   the climax. Truly may it be said that Poe invented the short story in its
   present form. His elevation of disease, perversity, and decay to the level
   of artistically expressible themes was likewise infinitely far-reaching in
   effect; for avidly seized, sponsored, and intensified by his eminent
   French admirer Charles Pierre Baudelaire, it became the nucleus of the
   principal aesthetic movements in France, thus making Poe in a sense the
   father of the Decadents and the Symbolists.

   Poet and critic by nature and supreme attainment, logician and philosopher
   by taste and mannerism, Poe was by no means immune from defects and
   affectations. His pretence to profound and obscure scholarship, his
   blundering ventures in stilted and laboured pseudo-humor, and his often
   vitriolic outbursts of critical prejudice must all be recognized and
   forgiven. Beyond and above them, and dwarfing them to insignificance, was
   a master's vision of the terror that stalks about and within us, and the
   worm that writhes and slavers in the hideously close abyss. Penetrating to
   every festering horror in the gaily painted mockery called existence, and
   in the solemn masquerade called human thought and feeling, that vision had
   power to project itself in blackly magical crystallisations and
   transmutations; till there bloomed in the sterile America of the thirties
   and forties such a moon-nourished garden of gorgeous poison fungi as not
   even the nether slopes of Saturn might boast. Verses and tales alike
   sustain the burthen of cosmic panic. The raven whose noisome beak pierces
   the heart, the ghouls that toll iron bells in pestilential steeples, the
   vault of Ulalume in the black October night, the shocking spires and domes
   under the sea, the "wild, weird clime that lieth, sublime, out of Space --
   out of Time" -- all these things and more leer at us amidst maniacal
   rattlings in the seething nightmare of the poetry. And in the prose there
   yawn open for us the very jaws of the pit -- inconceivable abnormalities
   slyly hinted into a horrible half-knowledge by words whose innocence we
   scarcely doubt till the cracked tension of the speaker's hollow voice bids
   us fear their nameless implications; daemoniac patterns and presences
   slumbering noxiously till waked for one phobic instant into a shrieking
   revelation that cackles itself to sudden madness or explodes in memorable
   and cataclysmic echoes. A Witches' Sabbath of horror flinging off decorous
   robes is flashed before us -- a sight the more monstrous because of the
   scientific skill with which every particular is marshaled and brought into
   an easy apparent relation to the known gruesomeness of material life.

   Poe's tales, of course, fall into several classes; some of which contain a
   purer essence of spiritual horror than others. The tales of logic and
   ratiocination, forerunners of the modern detective story, are not to be
   included at all in weird literature; whilst certain others, probably
   influenced considerably by Hoffmann, possess an extravagance which
   relegates them to the borderline of the grotesque. Still a third group
   deal with abnormal psychology and monomania in such a way as to express
   terror but not weirdness. A substantial residuum, however, represent the
   literature of supernatural horror in its acutest form; and give their
   author a permanent and unassailable place as deity and fountainhead of all
   modern diabolic fiction. Who can forget the terrible swollen ship poised
   on the billow-chasm's edge in MS. Found in a Bottle -- the dark
   intimations of her unhallowed age and monstrous growth, her sinister crew
   of unseeing greybeards, and her frightful southward rush under full sail
   through the ice of the Antarctic night, sucked onward by some resistless
   devil-current toward a vortex of eldritch enlightenment which must end in
   destruction?

   Then there is the unutterable M. Valdemar, kept together by hypnotism for
   seven months after his death, and uttering frantic sounds but a moment
   before the breaking of the spell leaves him "a nearly liquid mass of
   loathsome, of detestable putrescence." In the Narrative of A. Gordon Pym
   the voyagers reach first a strange south polar land of murderous savages
   where nothing is white and where vast rocky ravines have the form of
   titanic Egyptian letters spelling terrible primal arcana of earth; and
   thereafter a still more mysterious realm where everything is white, and
   where shrouded giants and snowy-plumed birds guard a cryptic cataract of
   mist which empties from immeasurable celestial heights into a torrid milky
   sea. Metzengerstein horrifies with its malign hints of a monstrous
   metempsychosis -- the mad nobleman who burns the stable of his hereditary
   foe; the colossal unknown horse that issues from the blazing building
   after the owner has perished therein; the vanishing bit of ancient
   tapestry where was shown the giant horse of the victim's ancestor in the
   Crusades; the madman's wild and constant riding on the great horse, and
   his fear and hatred of the steed; the meaningless prophecies that brood
   obscurely over the warring houses; and finally, the burning of the
   madman's palace and the death therein of the owner, borne helpless into
   the flames and up the vast staircase astride the beast he had ridden so
   strangely. Afterward the rising smoke of the ruins take the form of a
   gigantic horse. The Man of the Crowd, telling of one who roams day and
   night to mingle with streams of people as if afraid to be alone, has
   quieter effects, but implies nothing less of cosmic fear. Poe's mind was
   never far from terror and decay, and we see in every tale, poem, and
   philosophical dialogue a tense eagerness to fathom unplumbed wells of
   night, to pierce the veil of death, and to reign in fancy as lord of the
   frightful mysteries of time and space.

   Certain of Poe's tales possess an almost absolute perfection of artistic
   form which makes them veritable beacon-lights in the province of the short
   story. Poe could, when he wished, give to his prose a richly poetic cast;
   employing that archaic and Orientalised style with jeweled phrase,
   quasi-Biblical repetition, and recurrent burthen so successfully used by
   later writers like Oscar Wilde and Lord Dunsany; and in the cases where he
   has done this we have an effect of lyrical phantasy almost narcotic in
   essence -- an opium pageant of dream in the language of dream, with every
   unnatural colour and grotesque image bodied forth in a symphony of
   corresponding sound. The Masque of the Red Death, Silence, a Fable, and
   Shadow, a Parable, are assuredly poems in every sense of the word save the
   metrical one, and owe as much of their power to aural cadence as to visual
   imagery. But it is in two of the less openly poetic tales, Ligeia and The
   Fall of the House of Usher -- especially the latter -- that one finds
   those very summits of artistry whereby Poe takes his place at the head of
   fictional miniaturists. Simple and straightforward in plot, both of these
   tales owe their supreme magic to the cunning development which appears in
   the selection and collocation of every least incident. Ligeia tells of a
   first wife of lofty and mysterious origin, who after death returns through
   a preternatural force of will to take possession of the body of a second
   wife; imposing even her physical appearance on the temporary reanimated
   corpse of her victim at the last moment. Despite a suspicion of prolixity
   and topheaviness, the narrative reaches its terrific climax with
   relentless power. Usher, whose superiority in detail and proportion is
   very marked, hints shudderingly of obscure life in inorganic things, and
   displays an abnormally linked trinity of entities at the end of a long and
   isolated family history -- a brother, his twin sister, and their
   incredibly ancient house all sharing a single soul and meeting one common
   dissolution at the same moment.

   These bizarre conceptions, so awkward in unskillful hands, become under
   Poe's spell living and convincing terrors to haunt our nights; and all
   because the author understood so perfectly the very mechanics and
   physiology of fear and strangeness -- the essential details to emphasise,
   the precise incongruities and conceits to select as preliminaries or
   concomitants to horror, the exact incidents and allusions to throw out
   innocently in advance as symbols or prefigurings of each major step toward
   the hideous denouement to come, the nice adjustments of cumulative force
   and the unerring accuracy in linkage of parts which make for faultless
   unity throughout and thunderous effectiveness at the climactic moment, the
   delicate nuances of scenic and landscape value to select in establishing
   and sustaining the desired mood and vitalising the desired illusion --
   principles of this kind, and dozens of obscurer ones too elusive to be
   described or even fully comprehended by any ordinary commentator.
   Melodrama and unsophistication there may be -- we are told of one
   fastidious Frenchman who could not bear to read Poe except in Baudelaire's
   urbane and Gallically modulated translation -- but all traces of such
   things are wholly overshadowed by a potent and inborn sense of the
   spectral, the morbid, and the horrible which gushed forth from every cell
   of the artist's creative mentality and stamped his macabre work with the
   ineffaceable mark of supreme genius. Poe's weird tales are alive in a
   manner that few others can ever hope to be.

   Like most fantaisistes, Poe excels in incidents and broad narrative
   effects rather than in character drawing. His typical protagonist is
   generally a dark, handsome, proud, melancholy, intellectual, highly
   sensitive, capricious, introspective, isolated, and sometimes slightly mad
   gentleman of ancient family and opulent circumstances; usually deeply
   learned in strange lore, and darkly ambitious of penetrating to forbidden
   secrets of the universe. Aside from a high-sounding name, this character
   obviously derives little from the early Gothic novel; for he is clearly
   neither the wooden hero nor the diabolical villain of Radcliffian or
   Ludovician romance. Indirectly, however, he does possess a sort of
   genealogical connection; since his gloomy, ambitious and anti-social
   qualities savour strongly of the typical Byronic hero, who in turn is
   definitely an offspring,of the Gothic Manfreds, Montonis, and Ambrosios.
   More particular qualities appear to be derived from the psychology of Poe
   himself, who certainly possessed much of the depression, sensitiveness,
   mad aspiration, loneliness, and extravagant freakishness which he
   attributes to his haughty and solitary victims of Fate.

                      VIII. The Weird Tradition In America

   The public for whom Poe wrote, though grossly unappreciative of his art,
   was by no means accustomed to the horrors with which he dealt. America,
   besides inheriting the usual dark folk-lore of Europe, had an additional
   fund of weird associations to draw upon; so that spectral legends had
   already been recognised as fruitful subject-matter for literature. Charles
   Brockden Brown had achieved phenomenal fame with his Radcliffian romances,
   and Washington Irving's lighter treatment of eerie themes had quickly
   become classic. This additional fund proceeded, as Paul Elmer More has
   pointed out, from the keen spiritual and theological interests of the
   first colonists, plus the strange and forbidding nature of the scene into
   which they were plunged. The vast and gloomy virgin forests in whose
   perpetual twilight all terrors might well lurk; the hordes of coppery
   Indians whose strange, saturnine visages and violent customs hinted
   strongly at traces of infernal origin; the free rein given tinder the
   influence of Puritan theocracy to all manner of notions respecting man's
   relation to the stern and vengeful God of the Calvinists, and to the
   sulphureous Adversary of that God, about whom so much was thundered in the
   pulpits each Sunday; and the morbid introspection developed by an isolated
   backwoods life devoid of normal amusements and of the recreational mood,
   harassed by commands for theological self-examination, keyed to unnatural
   emotional repression, and forming above all a mere grim struggle for
   survival -- all these things conspired to produce an environment in which
   the black whisperings of sinister grandams were heard far beyond the
   chimney corner, and in which tales of witchcraft and unbelievable secret
   monstrosities lingered long after the dread days of the Salem nightmare.

   Poe represents the newer, more disillusioned, and more technically
   finished of the weird schools that rose out of this propitious milieu.
   Another school -- the tradition of moral values, gentle restraint, and
   mild, leisurely phantasy tinged more or less with the whimsical -- was
   represented by another famous, misunderstood, and lonely figure in
   American letters -- the shy and sensitive Nathaniel Hawthorne, scion of
   antique Salem and great-grandson of one of the bloodiest of the old
   witchcraft judges. In Hawthorne we have none of the violence, the daring,
   the high colouring, the intense dramatic sense, the cosmic malignity, and
   the undivided and impersonal artistry of Poe. Here, instead, is a gentle
   soul cramped by the Puritanism of early New England; shadowed and wistful,
   and grieved at an unmoral universe which everywhere transcends the
   conventional patterns thought by our forefathers to represent divine and
   immutable law. Evil, a very real force to Hawthorne, appears on every hand
   as a lurking and conquering adversary; and the visible world becomes in
   his fancy a theatre of infinite tragedy and woe, with unseen half-existent
   influences hovering over it and through it, battling for supremacy and
   moulding the destinies of the hapless mortals who form its vain and
   self-deluded population. The heritage of American weirdness was his to a
   most intense degree, and he saw a dismal throng of vague specters behind
   the common phenomena of life; but he was not disinterested enough to value
   impressions, sensations, and beauties of narration for their own sake. He
   must needs weave his phantasy into some quietly melancholy fabric of
   didactic or allegorical cast, in which his meekly resigned cynicism may
   display with naive moral appraisal the perfidy of a human race which he
   cannot cease to cherish and mourn despite his insight into its hypocrisy.
   Supernatural horror, then, is never a primary object with Hawthorne;
   though its impulses were so deeply woven into his personality that he
   cannot help suggesting it with the force of genius when he calls upon the
   unreal world to illustrate the pensive sermon he wishes to preach.

   Hawthorne's intimations of the weird, always gentle, elusive, and
   restrained, may be traced throughout his work. The mood that produced them
   found one delightful vent in the Teutonised retelling of classic myths for
   children contained in A Wonder Book and Tanglewood Tales, and at other
   times exercised itself in casting a certain strangeness and intangible
   witchery or malevolence over events not meant to be actually supernatural;
   as in the macabre posthumous novel Dr. Grimshawe's Secret, which invests
   with a peculiar sort of repulsion a house existing to this day in Salem,
   and abutting on the ancient Charter Street Burying Ground. In The Marble
   Faun, whose design was sketched out in an Italian villa reputed to be
   haunted, a tremendous background of genuine phantasy and mystery
   palpitates just beyond the common reader's sight; and glimpses of fabulous
   blood in mortal veins are hinted at during the course of a romance which
   cannot help being interesting despite the persistent incubus of moral
   allegory, anti-Popery propaganda, and a Puritan prudery which has caused
   the modern writer D. H. Lawrence to express a longing to treat the author
   in a highly undignified manner. Septimius Felton, a posthumous novel whose
   idea was to have been elaborated and incorporated into the unfinished
   Dolliver Romance, touches on the Elixir of Life in a more or less capable
   fashion whilst the notes for a never-written tale to be called The
   Ancestral Footstep show what Hawthorne would have done with an intensive
   treatment of an old English superstition -- that of an ancient and
   accursed line whose members left footprints of blood as they walked-which
   appears incidentally in both Septimius Felton and Dr. Grimshawe's Secret.

   Many of Hawthorne's shorter tales exhibit weirdness, either of atmosphere
   or of incident, to a remarkable degree. Edward Randolph's Portrait, in
   Legends of the Province House, has its diabolic moments. The Minister's
   Black Veil (founded on an actual incident) and The Ambitious Guest imply
   much more than they state, whilst Ethan Grand -- a fragment of a longer
   work never completed -- rises to genuine heights of cosmic fear with its
   vignette of the wild hill country and the blazing, desolate lime-kilns,
   and its delineation of the Byronic "unpardonable sinner," whose troubled
   life ends with a peal of fearful laughter in the night as he seeks rest
   amidst the flames of the furnace. Some of Hawthorne's notes tell of weird
   tales he would have written had he lived longer -- an especially vivid
   plot being that concerning a baffling stranger who appeared now and then
   in public assemblies, and who was at last followed and found to come and
   go from a very ancient grave.

   But foremost as a finished, artistic unit among all our author's weird
   material is the famous and exquisitely wrought novel, The House of the
   Seven Gables, in which the relentless working out of an ancestral curse is
   developed with astonishing power against the sinister background of a very
   ancient Salem house -- one of those peaked Gothic affairs which formed the
   first regular building-up of our New England coast towns but which gave
   way after the seventeenth century to the more familiar gambrel-roofed or
   classic Georgian types now known as "Colonial." Of these old gabled Gothic
   houses scarcely a dozen are to be seen today in their original condition
   throughout the United States, but one well known to Hawthorne still stands
   in Turner Street, Salem, and is pointed out with doubtful authority as the
   scene and inspiration of the romance. Such an edifice, with its spectral
   peaks, its clustered chimneys, its overhanging second story, its grotesque
   corner-brackets, and its diamond-paned lattice windows, is indeed an
   object well calculated to evoke sombre reflections; typifying as it does
   the dark Puritan age of concealed horror and witch-whispers which preceded
   the beauty, rationality, and spaciousness of the eighteenth century.
   Hawthorne saw many in his youth, and knew the black tales connected with
   some of them. He heard, too, many rumours of a curse upon his own line as
   the result of his great-grandfather's severity as a witchcraft judge in
   1692.

   From this setting came the immortal tale -- New England's greatest
   contribution to weird literature -- and we can feel in an instant the
   authenticity of the atomosphere presented to us. Stealthy horror and
   disease lurk within the weather-blackened, moss-crusted, and elm-shadowed
   walls of the archaic dwelling so vividly displayed, and we grasp the
   brooding malignity of the place when we read that its builder -- old
   Colonel Pyncheon -- snatched the land with peculiar ruthlessness from its
   original settler, Matthew Maule, whom he condemned to the gallows as a
   wizard in the year of the panic. Maule died cursing old Pyncheon -- "God
   will give him blood to drink" -- and the waters of the old well on the
   seized land turned bitter. Maule's carpenter son consented to build the
   great gabled house for his fathet's triumphant enemy, but the old Colonel
   died strangely on the day of its dedication. Then followed generations of
   odd vicissitudes, with queer whispers about the dark powers of the Maules,
   and sometimes terrible ends befalling the Pyncheons.

   The overshadowing malevolence of the ancient house -- almost as alive as
   Poe's House of Usher, though in a subtler way -- pervades the tale as a
   recurrent motif pervades in operatic tragedy; and when the main story is
   reached, we behold the modern Pyncheons in a pitiable state of decay. Poor
   old Hepzibah, the eccentric reduced gentlewoman; childlike, unfortunate
   Clifford, just released from undeserved imprisonment; sly and treacherous
   judge Pyncheon, who is the old Colonel all over again -- all these figures
   are tremendous symbols, and are well matched by the stunted vegetation and
   anaemic fowls in the garden. It was almost a pity to supply a fairly happy
   ending, with a union of sprightly Phaebe, cousin and last scion of the
   Pyncheons, to the prepossessing young man who turns out to be the last of
   the Maules. This union, presumably, ends the curse. Hawthorne avoids all
   violence of diction or movement, and keeps his implications of terror well
   in the background; but occasional glimpses amply serve to sustain the mood
   and redeem the work from pure allegorical aridity. Incidents like the
   bewitching of Alice Pyncheon in the early eighteenth century, and the
   spectral music of her harpsichord which precedes a death in the family --
   the latter a variant of an immemorial type of Aryan myth -- link the
   action directly with the supernatural; whilst the dead nocturnal vigil of
   old judge Pyncheon in the ancient parlour, with his frightfully ticking
   watch, is stark horror of the most poignant and genuine sort. The way in
   which the judge's death is first adumbrated by the motions and sniffing of
   a strange cat outside the window, long before the fact is suspected by the
   reader or by any of the characters, is a stroke of genius which Poe could
   not have surpassed. Later the strange cat watches intently outside that
   same window in the night and on the next day, for -- something. It is
   clearly the psychopomp of primeval myth, fitted and adapted with infinite
   deftness to its latter-day setting.

   But Hawthorne left no well-defined literary posterity. His mood and
   attitude belonged to the age which closed with him, and it is the spirit
   of Poe -- who so clearly and realistically understood the natural basis of
   the horror-appeal and the correct mechanics of its achievement -- which
   survived and blossomed. Among the earliest of Poe's disciples may be
   reckoned the brilliant young Irishman Fitz James O'Brien (1828-1862), who
   became naturalised as an American and perished honourably in the Civil
   War. It is he who gave us What Was It?, the first well-shaped short story
   of a tangible but invisible being, and the prototype of de Maupassant's
   Horla; he also who created the inimitable Diamond Lens, in which a young
   microscopist falls in love with a maiden of an infinitesimal world which
   he has discovered in a drop of water. O'Brien's early death undoubtedly
   deprived us of some masterful tales of strangeness and terror, though his
   genius was not, properly speaking, of the same titan quality which
   characterised Poe and Hawthorne.

   Closer to real greatness was the eccentric and saturnine journalist
   Ambrose Bierce, born in 1842; who likewise entered the Civil War, but
   survived to write some immortal tales and to disappear in 1913 in as great
   a cloud of mystery as any he ever evoked from his nightmare fancy. Bierce
   was a satirist and pamphleteer of note, but the bulk of his artistic
   reputation must rest upon his grim and savage short stories; a large
   number of which deal with the Civil War and form the most vivid and
   realistic expression which that conflict has yet received in fiction.
   Virtually all of Bierce's tales are tales of horror; and whilst many of
   them treat only of the physical and psychological horrors within Nature, a
   substantial proportion admit the malignly supernatural and form a leading
   element in America's fund of weird literature. Mr. Samuel Loveman, a
   living poet and critic who was personally acquainted with Bierce, thus
   sums up the genius of the great "shadow-maker" in the preface to some of
   his letters:

     In Bierce the evocation of horror becomes for the first time not so much
     the prescription or perversion of Poe and Maupassant, but an atmosphere
     definite and uncannily precise. Words, so simple that one would be prone
     to ascribe them to the limitations of a literary hack, take on an unholy
     horror, a new and unguessed transformation. In Poe one finds it a tour
     de force, in Maupassant a nervous engagement of the flagellated climax.
     To Bierce, simply and sincerely, diabolism held in its tormented death a
     legitimate and reliant means to the end. Yet a tacit confirmation with
     Nature is in every instance insisted upon.

     In The Death of Halpin Frayser flowers, verdure, and the boughs and
     leaves of trees are magnificently placed as an opposing foil to
     unnatural malignity. Not the accustomed golden world, but a world
     pervaded with the mystery of blue and the breathless recalcitrance of
     dreams is Bierce's. Yet, curiously, inhumanity is not altogether absent.

   The "inhumanity" mentioned by Mr. Loveman finds vent in a rare strain of
   sardonic comedy and graveyard humour, and a kind of delight in images of
   cruelty and tantalising disappointment. The former quality is well
   illustrated by some of the subtitles in the darker narratives; such as
   "One does not always eat what is on the table", describing a body laid out
   for a coroner's inquest, and "A man though naked may be in rags,"
   referring to a frightfully mangled corpse.

   Bierce's work is in general somewhat uneven. Many of the stories are
   obviously mechanical, and marred by a jaunty and commonplacely artificial
   style derived from journalistic models; but the grim malevolence stalking
   through all of them is unmistakable, and several stand out as permanent
   mountain-peaks of American weird writing. The Death of Halpin Frayser,
   called by Frederic Taber Cooper the most fiendishly ghastly tale in the
   literature of the Anglo-Saxon race, tells of a body skulking by night
   without a soul in a weird and horribly ensanguined wood, and of a man
   beset by ancestral memories who met death at the claws of that which had
   been his fervently loved mother. The Damned Thing, frequently copied in
   popular anthologies, chronicles the hideous devastations of an invisible
   entity that waddles and flounders on the hills and in the wheatfields by
   night and day. The Suitable Surroundings evoke's with singular subtlety
   yet apparent simplicity a piercing sense of the terror which may reside in
   the written word. In the story the weird author Colston says to his friend
   Marsh, "You are brave enough to read me in a street-car, but -- in a
   deserted house -- alone -- in the forest -- at night! Bah! I have a
   manuscript in my pocket that would kill you!" Marsh reads the manuscript
   in "the suitable surroundings -- and it does kill him. The Middle Toe of
   the Right Foot is clumsily developed, but has a powerful climax. A man
   named Manton has horribly killed his two children and his wife, the latter
   of whom lacked the middle toe of the right foot. Ten years later he
   returns much altered to the neighbourhood; and, being secretly recognised,
   is provoked into a bowie-knife duel in the dark, to be held in the now
   abandond house where his crime was committed. When the moment of the duel
   arrives a trick is played upon him; and he is left without an antagonist,
   shut in a night-black ground floor room of the reputedly haunted edifice,
   with the thick dust of a decade on every hand. No knife is drawn against
   him, for only a thorough scare is intended; but on the next day he is
   found crouched in a corner with distorted face, dead of sheer fright at
   something he has seen. The only clue visible to the discoverers is one
   having terrible implications: "In the dust of years that lay thick upon
   the floor -- leading from the door by which they had entered, straight
   across the room to within a yard of Manton's crouching corpse -- were
   three parallel lines of footprints -- light but definite impressions of
   bare feet, the outer ones those of small children, the inner a woman's.
   From the point at which they ended they did not return; they pointed all
   one way." And, of course, the woman's prints showed a lack of the middle
   toe of the right foot. The Spook House, told with a severely homely air of
   journalistic verisimilitude, conveys terrible hints of shocking mystery.
   In 1858 an entire family of seven persons disappears suddenly and
   unaccountably from a plantation house in eastern Kentucky, leaving all its
   possessions untouched -- furniture, clothing, food supplies, horses,
   cattle, and slaves. About a year later two men of high standing are forced
   by a storm to take shelter in the deserted dwelling, and in so doing
   stumble into a strange subterranean room lit by an unaccountable greenish
   light and having an iron door which cannot be opened from within. In this
   room lie the decayed corpses of all the missing family; and as one of the
   discoverers rushes forward to embrace a body he seems to recognise, the
   other is so overpowered by a strange foetor that he accidentally shuts his
   companion in the vault and loses consciousness. Recovering his senses six
   weeks later, the survivor is unable to find the hidden room; and the house
   is burned during the Civil War. The imprisoned discoverer is never seen or
   heard of again.

   Bierce seldom realises the atmospheric possibilities of his themes as
   vividly as Poe; and much of his work contains a certain touch of naivete,
   prosaic angularity, or early-American provincialism which contrasts
   somewhat with the efforts of later horror-masters. Nevertheless the
   genuineness and artistry of his dark intimations are always unmistakable,
   so that his greatness is in no danger of eclipse. As arranged in his
   definitively collected works, Bierce's weird tales occur mainly in two
   volumes, Can Such Things Be? and In the Midst of Life. The former, indeed,
   is almost wholly given over to the supernatural.

   Much of the best in American horror-literature has come from pens not
   mainly devoted to that medium. Oliver Wendell Holmes's historic Elsie
   Venner suggests with admirable restraint an unnatural ophidian element in
   a young woman prenatally influenced, and sustains the atmosphere with
   finely discriminating landscape touches. In The Turn of the Screw Henry
   James triumphs over his inevitable pomposity and prolixity sufficiently
   well to create a truly potent air of sinister menace; depicting the
   hideous influence of two dead and evil servants, Peter Quint and the
   governess, Miss Jessel, over a small boy and girl who had been under their
   care. James is perhaps too diffuse, too unctuously urbane, and too much
   addicted to subtleties of speech to realise fully all the wild and
   devastating horror in his situations; but for all that there is a rare and
   mounting tide of fright, culminating in the death of the little boy, which
   gives the novelette a permanent place in its special class.

   F. Marion Crawford produced several weird tales of varying quality, now
   collected in a volume entitled Wandering Ghosts. For the Blood is the Life
   touches powerfully on a case of moon-cursed vampirism near an ancient
   tower on the rocks of the lonely South Italian seacoast. The Dead Smile
   treats of family horrors in an old house and an ancestral vault in
   Ireland, and introduces the banshee with considerable force. The Upper
   Berth, however, is Crawford's weird masterpiece; and is one of the most
   tremendous horror-stories in all literature. In this tale of a
   suicide-haunted stateroom such things as the spectral saltwater dampness,
   the strangely open porthole, and the nightmare struggle with the nameless
   object are handled with incomparable dexterity.

   Very genuine, though not without the typical mannered extravagance of the
   eighteen-nineties, is the strain of horror in the early work of Robert W.
   Chambers, since renowned for products of a very different quality. The
   King in Yellow, a series of vaguely connected short stories having as a
   background a monstrous and suppressed book whose perusal brings fright,
   madness, and spectral tragedy, really achieves notable heights of cosmic
   fear in spite of uneven interest and a somewhat trivial and affected
   cultivation of the Gallic studio atmosphere made popular by Du Maurier's
   Trilby. The most powerful of its tales, perhaps, is The Yellow Sign, in
   which is introduced a silent and terrible churchyard watchman with a face
   like a puffy grave-worm's. A boy, describing a tussle he has had with this
   creature, shivers and sickens as he relates a certain detail. "Well, it's
   Gawd's truth that when I 'it 'im 'e grabbed me wrists, Sir, and when I
   twisted 'is soft, mushy fist one of 'is fingers come off in me 'and." An
   artist, who after seeing him has shared with another a strange dream of a
   nocturnal hearse, is shocked by the voice with which the watchman accosts
   him. The fellow emits a muttering sound that fills the head "like thick
   oily smoke from a fat-rendering vat or an odour of noisome decay." What he
   mumbles is merely this: "Have you found The Yellow Sign?"

   A weirdly hieroglyphed onyx talisman, picked up on the street by the
   sharer of his dream, is shortly given the artist; and after stumbling
   queerly upon the hellish and forbidden book of horrors the two learn,
   among other hideous things which no sane mortal should know, that this
   talisman is indeed the nameless Yellow Sign handed down from the accursed
   cult of Hastur -- from primordial Carcosa, whereof the volume treats, and
   some nightmare memory of which seeks to lurk latent and ominous at the
   back of all men's minds. Soon they hear the rumbling of the black-plumed
   hearse driven by the flabby and corpse-faced watchman. He enters the
   night-shrouded house in quest of The Yellow Sign, all bolts and bars
   rotting at his touch. And when the people rush in, drawn by a scream that
   no human throat could utter, they find three forms on the floor -- two
   dead and one dying. One of the dead shapes is far gone in decay. It is the
   churchyard watchman, and the doctor exclaims, "That man must have been
   dead for months." It is worth observing that the author derives most of
   the names and allusions connected with his eldritch land of primal memory
   from the tales of Ambrose Bierce. Other early works of Mr. Chambers
   displaying the outre and macabre element are The Maker of Moons and In
   Search of the Unknown. One cannot help regretting that he did not further
   develop a vein in which he could so easily have become a recognised
   master.

   Horror material of authentic force may be found in the work of the New
   England realist Mary E. Wilkins, whose volume of short tales, The Wind in
   the Rosebush, contains a number of noteworthy achievements. In The Shadows
   on the Wall we are shown with consummate skill the response of a staid New
   England household to uncanny tragedy; and the sourceless shadow of the
   poisoned brother well prepares us for the climactic moment when the shadow
   of the secret murderer, who has killed himself in a neighbouring city,
   suddenly appears beside it. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in The Yellow Wall
   Paper, rises to a classic level in subtly delineating the madness which
   crawls over a woman dwelling in the hideously papered room where a
   madwoman was once confined.

   In The Dead Valley the eminent architect and mediaevalist Ralph Adams Cram
   achieves a memorably potent degree of vague regional horror through
   subtleties of atmosphere and description.

   Still further carrying on our spectral tradition is the gifted and
   versatile humourist Irvin S. Cobb, whose work both early and recent
   contains some finely weird specimens. Fishhead, an early achievement, is
   banefully effective in its portrayal of unnatural affinities between a
   hybrid idiot and the strange fish of an isolated lake, which at the last
   avenge their biped kinsman's murder. Later work of Mr. Cobb introduces an
   element of possible science, as in the tale of hereditary memory where a
   modern man with a negroid strain utters words in African jungle speech
   when run down by a train under visual and aural circumstances recalling
   the maiming of his black ancestor by a rhinoceros a century before.

   Extremely high in artistic stature is the novel The Dark Chamber (1927) by
   the late Leonard Cline. This is the tale of a man who -- with the
   characteristic ambition of the Gothic or Byronic hero-villain -- seeks to
   defy nature and recapture every moment of his past life through the
   abnormal stimulation of memory. To this end he employs endless notes,
   records, mnemonic objects, and pictures -- and finally odours, music, and
   exotic drugs. At last his ambition goes beyond his personal life and
   reaches toward the black abysses of hereditary memory -- even back to
   pre-human days amidst the steaming swamps of the carboniferous age, and to
   still more unimaginable deeps of primal time and entity. He calls for
   madder music and takes stranger drugs, and finally his great dog grows
   oddly afraid of him. A noxious animal stench encompasses him, and he grows
   vacant-faced and subhuman. In the end he takes to the woods, howling at
   night beneath windows. He is finally found in a thicket, mangled to death.
   Beside him is the mangled corpse of his dog. They have killed each other.
   The atmosphere of this novel is malevolently potent, much attention being
   paid to the central figure's sinister home and household.

   A less subtle and well-balanced but nevertheless highly effective creation
   is Herbert S. Gorman's novel, The Place Called Dagon, which relates the
   dark history of a western Massachusetts back-water where the descendants
   of refugees from the Salem witchcraft still keep alive the morbid and
   degenerate horrors of the Black Sabbat.

   Sinister House, by Leland Hall, has touches of magnificent atmosphere but
   is marred by a somewhat mediocre romanticism.

   Very notable in their way are some of the weird conceptions of the
   novelist and short-story writer Edward Lucas White, most of whose themes
   arise from actual dreams. The Song of The Siren has a very persuasive
   strangeness, while such things as Lukundoo and The Snout arouse darker
   apprehensions. Mr. White imparts a very peculiar quality to his tales --
   an oblique sort of glamour which has its own distinctive type of
   convincingness.

   Of younger Americans, none strikes the note of cosmic horror so well as
   the California poet, artist and fictionist Clark Ashton Smith, whose
   bizarre writing, drawings, paintings and stories are the delight of a
   sensitive few. Mr. Smith has for his background a universe of remote and
   paralysing fright - jungles of poisonous and iridescent blossoms on the
   moons of Saturn, evil and grotesque temples in Atlantis, Lemuria, and
   forgotten elder worlds, and dank morasses of spotted death-fungi in
   spectral countries beyond earth's rim. His longest and most ambitious
   poem, The Hashish-Eater, is in pentameter blank verse; and opens up
   chaotic and incredible vistas of kaleidoscopic nightmare in the spaces
   between the stars. In sheet daemonic strangeness and fertility of
   conception, Mr. Smith is perhaps unexcelled by any other writer dead or
   living. Who else has seen such gorgeous, luxuriant, and feverishly
   distorted visions of infinite spheres and multiple dimensions and lived to
   tell the tale? His short stories deal powerfully with other galaxies,
   worlds, and dimensions, as well as with strange regions and aeons on the
   earth. He tells of primal Hyperborea and its black amorphous god
   Tsathoggua; of the lost continent Zothique, and of the fabulous,
   Vampire-curst land of Averoigne in mediaeval France. Some of Mr. Smith's
   best work can be found in the brochure entitled The Double Shadow and
   Other Fantasies (1933).

                  IX. The Weird Tradition In The British Isles

   Recent British literature, besides including the three or four greatest
   fantaisistes of the present age, has been gratifyingly fertile in the
   element of the weird. Rudyard Kipling has often approached it, and has,
   despite the omnipresent mannerisms, handled it with indubitable mastery in
   such tales as The Phantom Rickshaw, The Finest Story in the World, The
   Recrudescence of Imray, and The Mark of the Beast. This latter is of
   particular poignancy; the pictures of the naked leper-priest who mewed
   like an otter, of the spots which appeared on the chest of the man that
   priest cursed, of the growing carnivorousness of the victim and of the
   fear which horses began to display toward him, and of the eventually
   half-accomplished transformation of that victim into a leopard, being
   things which no reader is ever likely to forget. The final defeat of the
   malignant sorcery does not impair the force of the tale or the validity of
   its mystery.

   Lafcadio Hearn, strange, wandering, and exotic, departs still farther from
   the realm of the real; and with the supreme artistry of a sensitive poet
   weaves phantasies impossible to an author of the solid roast beef type.
   His Fantastics, written in America, contains some of the most impressive
   ghoulishness in all literature; whilst his Kwaidan, written in Japan,
   crystallises with matchless skill and delicacy the eerie lore and
   whispered legends of that richly colourful nation. Still more of Helm's
   wizardry of language is shown in some of his translations from the French,
   especially from Gautier and Flaubert. His version of the latter's
   Temptation of St. Anthony is a classic of fevered and riotous imagery clad
   in the magic of singing words.

   Oscar Wilde may likewise be given a place amongst weird writers, both for
   certain of his exquisite fairy tales, and for his vivid Picture of Dorian
   Gray, in which a marvellous portrait for years assumes the duty of aging
   and coarsening instead of its original, who meanwhile plunges into every
   excess of vice and crime without the outward loss of youth, beauty, and
   freshness. There is a sudden and potent climax when Dorian Gray, at last
   become a murderer, seeks to destroy the painting whose changes testify to
   his moral degeneracy. He stabs it with a knife, and a hideous cry and
   crash are heard; but when the servants enter they find it in all its
   pristine loveliness. "Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress,
   with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of
   visage. It was not until they had examined the rings that they recognised
   who he was."

   Matthew Phipps Shiel, author of many weird, grotesque, and adventurous
   novels and tales, occasionally attains a high level of horrific magic.
   Xelucha is a noxiously hideous fragment, but is excelled by Mr. Shiel's
   undoubted masterpiece, The House of Sounds, floridly written in the
   "yellow nineties," and recast with more artistic restraint in the early
   twentieth century. This story, in final form, deserves a place among the
   foremost things of its kind. It tells of a creeping horror and menace
   trickling down the centuries on a sub-arctic island off the coast of
   Norway; where, amidst the sweep of daemon winds and the ceaseless din of
   hellish waves and cataracts, a vengeful dead man built a brazen tower of
   terror. It is vaguely like, yet infinitely unlike, Poe's Fall of the House
   of Usher. In the novel The Purple Cloud Mr. Shiel describes with
   tremendous power a curse which came out of the arctic to destroy mankind,
   and which for a time appears to have left but a single inhabitant on our
   planet. The sensations of this lone survivor as he realises his position,
   and roams through the corpse-littered and treasure-strewn cities of the
   world as their absolute master, are delivered with a skill and artistry
   falling little short of actual majesty. Unfortunately the second half of
   the book, with its conventionally romantic element, involves a distinct
   letdown.

   Better known than Shiel is the ingenious Bram Stoker, who created many
   starkly horrific conceptions in a series of novels whose poor technique
   sadly impairs their net effect. The Lair of the White Worm, dealing with a
   gigantic primitive entity that lurks in a vault beneath an ancient castle,
   utterly ruins a magnificent idea by a development almost infantile. The
   Jewel of Seven Stars, touching on a strange Egyptian resurrection, is less
   crudely written. But best of all is the famous Dracula, which has become
   almost the standard modern exploitation of the frightful vampire myth.
   Count Dracula, a vampire, dwells in a horrible castle in the Carpathians,
   but finally migrates to England with the design of populating the country
   with fellow vampires. How an Englishman fares within Dracula's stronghold
   of terrors, and how the dead fiend's plot for domination is at last
   defeated, are elements which unite to form a tale now justly assigned a
   permanent place in English letters. Dracula evoked many similar novels of
   supernatural horror, among which the best are perhaps The Beetle, by
   Richard Marsh, Brood of the Witch-Queen, by "Sax Rohmer" (Arthur Sarsfield
   Ward), and The Door of the Unreal, by Gerald Bliss. The latter handles
   quite dexterously the standard werewolf superstition. Much subtler and
   more artistic, and told with singular skill through the juxtaposed
   narratives of the several characters, is the novel Cold Harbour, by
   Francis Brett Young, in which an ancient house of strange malignancy is
   powerfully delineated. The mocking and well-nigh omnipotent fiend Humphrey
   Furnival holds echoes of the Manfred-Montoni type of early Gothic
   "villain," but is redeemed from triteness by many clever individualities.
   Only the slight diffuseness of explanation at the close, and the somewhat
   too free use of divination as a plot factor, keep this tale from
   approaching absolute perfection.

   In the novel Witch Wood John Buchan depicts with tremendous force a
   survival of the evil Sabbat in a lonely district of Scotland. The
   description of the black forest with the evil stone, and of the terrible
   cosmic adumbrations when the horror is finally extirpated, will repay one
   for wading through the very gradual action and plethora of Scottish
   dialect. Some of Mr. Buchan's short stories are also extremely vivid in
   their spectral intimations; The Green Wildebeest, a tale of African
   witchcraft, The Wind in the Portico, with its awakening of dead
   Britanno-Roman horrors, and Skule Skerry, with its touches of sub-arctic
   fright, being especially remarkable.

   Clemence Housman, in the brief novelette The Werewolf, attains a high
   degree of gruesome tension and achieves to some extent the atmosphere of
   authentic folklore. In The Elixir of Life Arthur Ransome attains some
   darkly excellent effects despite a general naivete of plot, while H. B.
   Drake's The Shadowy Thing summons up strange and terrible vistas. George
   Macdonald's Lilith has a compelling bizarrerie all its own, the first and
   simpler of the two versions being perhaps the more effective.

   Deserving of distinguished notice as a forceful craftsman to whom an
   unseen mystic world is ever a dose and vital reality is the poet Walter de
   la Mare, whose haunting verse and exquisite prose alike bear consistent
   traces of a strange vision reaching deeply into veiled spheres of beauty
   and terrible and forbidden dimensions of being. In the novel The Return we
   see the soul of a dead man reach out of its grave of two centuries and
   fasten itself upon the flesh of the living, so that even the face of the
   victim becomes that which had long ago returned to dust. Of the shorter
   tales, of which several volumes exist, many are unforgettable for their
   command of fear's and sorcery's darkest ramifications; notably Seaton's
   Aunt, in which there lowers a noxious background of malignant vampirism;
   The Tree, which tells of a frightful vegetable growth in the yard of a
   starving artist; Out of the Deep, wherein we are given leave to imagine
   what thing answered the summons of a dying wastrel in a dark lonely house
   when he pulled a long-feared bell-cord in the attic of his dread-haunted
   boyhood; A Recluse, which hints at what sent a chance guest flying from a
   house in the night; Mr. Kempe, which shows us a mad clerical hermit in
   quest of the human soul, dwelling in a frightful sea-cliff region beside
   an archaic abandoned chapel; and All-Hallows, a glimpse of daemoniac
   forces besieging a lonely mediaeval church and miraculously restoring the
   rotting masonry. De la Mare does not make fear the sole or even the
   dominant element of most of his tales, being apparently more interested in
   the subtleties of character involved. Occasionally he sinks to sheer
   whimisical phantasy of the Barrie order. Still he is among the very few to
   whom unreality is a vivid, living presence; and as such he is able to put
   into his occasional fear-studies a keen potency which only a rare master
   can achieve. His poem The Listeners restores the Gothic shudder to modern
   verse.

   The weird short story has fared well of late, an important contributor
   being the versatile E. F. Benson, whose The Man Who Went Too Far breathes
   whisperingly of a house at the edge of a dark wood, and of Pan's hoof-mark
   on the breast of a dead man. Mr. Benson's volume, Visible and Invisible,
   contains several stories of singular power; notably Negotiam Perambulans,
   whose unfolding reveals an abnormal monster from an ancient ecclesiastical
   panel which performs an act of miraculous vengeance in a lonely village on
   the Cornish coast, and The Horror-Horn, through which lopes a terrible
   half-human survival dwelling on unvisited Alpine peaks. The Face, in
   another collection, is lethally potent, in its relentless aura of doom. H.
   R. Wakefield, in his collections, They Return at Evening and Others Who
   Return, manages now and then to achieve great heights of horror despite a
   vitiating air of sophistication. The most notable stories are The Red
   Lodge with its slimy acqueous evil, He Cometh and He Passeth By, And He
   Shall Sing, The Cairn, Look Up There, Blind Man's Buff, and that bit of
   lurking millennial horror, The Seventeenth Hole at Duncaster. Mention has
   been made of the weird work of H. G. Wells and A. Conan Doyle. The former,
   in The Ghost of Fear, reaches a very high level while all the items in
   Thirty Strange Stories have strong fantastic implications. Doyle now and
   then struck a powerfully spectral note, as in The Captain of the
   Pole-Star, a tale of arctic ghostliness, and Lot No. 249, wherein the
   reanimated mummy theme is used with more than ordinary skill. Hugh
   Walpole, of the same family as the founder of Gothic fiction, has
   sometimes approached the bizarre with much success, his short story Mrs.
   Lunt carrying a very poignant shudder. John Metcalfe, in the collection
   published as The Smoking Leg, attains now and then a rare pitch of
   potency, the tale entitled The Bad Lands, containing graduations of horror
   that strongly savour of genius. More whimiscial and inclined toward the
   amiable and innocuous phantasy of Sir J. M. Barrie are the short tales of
   E.M. Forster, grouped under the title of The Celestial Omnibus. Of these
   only one, dealing with a glimpse of Pan and his aura of fright, may be
   said to hold the true element of cosmic horror. Mrs. H.D. Everett, though
   adhering to very old and conventional models, occasionally reaches
   singular heights of spiritual terror in her collection of short stories,
   The Death Mask. L. P. Hartley is notable for his incisive and extremely
   ghastly tale, A Visitor from Down Under, May Sinclair's Uncanny Stories
   contain more of traditional "occultism" than of that creative treatment of
   fear which marks mastery in this field, and are inclined to lay more
   stress on human emotions and psychological delving than upon the stark
   phenomena of a cosmos utterly unreal. It may be well to remark here that
   occult believers are probably less effective than materialists in
   delineating the spectral and the fantastic, since to them the phantom
   world is so commonplace a reality that they tend to refer to it with less
   awe, remoteness, and impressiveness than do those who see in it an
   absolute and stupendous violation of the natural order.

   Of rather uneven stylistic quality, but vast occasional power in its
   suggestion of lurking worlds and beings behind the ordinary surface of
   life, is the work of William Hope Hodgson, known today far less than it
   deserves to be. Despite a tendency toward conventionally sentimental
   conceptions of the universe, and of man's relation to it and to his
   fellows, Mr. Hodgson is perhaps second only to Algernon Blackwood in his
   serious treatment of unreality. Few can equal him in adumbrating the
   nearness of nameless forces and monstrous besieging entities through
   casual hints and insignificant details, or in conveying feelings of the
   spectral and the abnormal in connection with regions or buildings.

   In The Boats of the Glen Carrig (1907) we are shown a variety of malign
   marvels and accursed unknown lands as encountered by the survivors of a
   sunken ship. The brooding menace in the earlier parts of the book is
   impossible to surpass, though a letdown in the direction of ordinary
   romance and adventure occurs toward the end. An inaccurate and
   pseudo-romantic attempt to reproduce eighteenth-century prose detracts
   from the general effect, but the really profound nautical erudition
   everywhere displayed is a compensating factor.

   The House on the Borderland (1908) -- perhaps the greatest of all Mr.
   Hodgson's works -- tells of a lonely and evilly regarded house in Ireland
   which forms a focus for hideous otherworld forces and sustains a siege by
   blasphemous hybrid anomalies from a hidden abyss below. The wanderings of
   the Narrator's spirit through limitless light-years of cosmic space and
   Kalpas of eternity, and its witnessing of the solar system's final
   destruction, constitute something almost unique in standard literature.
   And everywhere there is manifest the author's power to suggest vague,
   ambushed horrors in natural scenery. But for a few touches of commonplace
   sentimentality this book would be a classic of the first water.

   The Ghost Pirates (1909), regarded by Mr. Hodgson as rounding out a
   trilogy with the two previously mentioned works, is a powerful account of
   a doomed and haunted ship on its last voyage, and of the terrible
   sea-devils (of quasi-human aspect, and perhaps the spirits of bygone
   buccaneers) that besiege it and finally drag it down to an unknown fate.
   With its command of maritime knowledge, and its clever selection of hints
   and incidents suggestive of latent horrors in nature, this book at times
   reaches enviable peaks of power.

   The Night Land (1912) is a long-extended (538 pp.) tale of the earth's
   infinitely remote future -- billions of billions of years ahead, after the
   death of the sun. It is told in a rather clumsy fashion, as the dreams of
   a man in the seventeenth century, whose mind merges with its own future
   incarnation; and is seriously marred by painful verboseness,
   repetitiousness, artificial and nauseously sticky romantic sentimentality,
   and an attempt at archaic language even more grotesque and absurd than
   that in Glen Carrig.

   Allowing for all its faults, it is yet one of the most potent pieces of
   macabre imagination ever written. The picture of a night-black, dead
   planet, with the remains of the human race concentrated in a stupendously
   vast metal pyramid and besieged by monstrous, hybrid, and altogether
   unknown forces of the darkness, is something that no reader can ever
   forget: Shapes and entities of an altogether non-human and inconceivable
   sort -- the prowlers of the black, man-forsaken, and unexplored world
   outside the pyramid -- are suggested and partly described with ineffable
   potency; while the night-land landscape with its chasms and slopes and
   dying volcanism takes on an almost sentient terror beneath the author's
   touch.

   Midway in the book the central figure ventures outside the pyramid on a
   quest through death-haunted realms untrod by man for millions of years --
   and in his slow, minutely described, day-by-day progress over unthinkable
   leagues of immemorial blackness there is a sense of cosmic alienage,
   breathless mystery, and terrified expectancy unrivalled in the whole range
   of literature. The last quarter of the book drags woefully, but fails to
   spoil the tremendous power of the whole. Mr. Hodgson's later volume,
   Carnacki, the Ghost-Finder, consists of several longish short stories
   published many years before in magazines. In quality it falls
   conspicuously below the level of the other books. We here find a more or
   less conventional stock figure of the "infallible detective" type -- the
   progeny of M. Dupin and Sherlock Holmes, and the close kin of Algernon
   Blackwood's John Silence -- moving through scenes and events badly marred
   by an atmosphere of professional "occultism." A few of the episodes,
   however, are of undeniable power, and afford glimpses of the peculiar
   genius characteristic of the author.

   Naturally it is impossible in brief sketch to trace out all the classic
   modern uses of the terror element. The ingredient must of necessity enter
   into all work, both prose and verse, treating broadly of life; and we are
   therefore not surprised to find a share in such writers as the poet
   Browning, whose Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came is instinct with
   hideous menace, or the novelist Joseph Conrad, who often wrote of the dark
   secrets within the sea, and of the daemoniac driving power of Fate as
   influencing the lives of lonely and maniacally resolute men. Its trail is
   one of infinite ramifications; but we must here confine ourselves to its
   appearance in a relatively unmixed state, where it determines and
   dominates the work of art containing it.

   Somewhat separate from the main British stream is that current of
   weirdness in Irish literature which came to the fore in the Celtic
   Renaissance of the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Ghost
   and fairy lore have always been of great prominence in Ireland, and for
   over a hundred years have been recorded by a line of such faithful
   transcribers and translators as William Carleton, T. Crofton Croker, Lady
   Wilde -- mother of Oscar Wilde -- Douglas Hyde, and W.B. Yeats. Brought to
   notice by the modern movement, this body of myth has been carefully
   collected and studied; and its salient features reproduced in the work of
   later figures like Yeats, J. M. Synge, "A. E.," Lady Gregory, Padraic
   Colum, James Stephens and their colleagues.

   Whilst on the whole more whimsically fantastic than terrible, such
   folklore and its consciously artistic counterparts contain much that falls
   truly within the domain of cosmic horror. Tales of burials in sunken
   churches beneath haunted lakes, accounts of death-heralding banshees and
   sinister changelings, ballads of spectres and "the unholy creatures of the
   Raths" -- all these have their poignant and definite shivers, and mark a
   strong and distinctive element in weird literature. Despite homely
   grotesqueness and absolute naivete, there is genuine nightmare in the
   class of narrative represented by the yarn of Teig O'Kane, who in
   punishment for his wild life was ridden all night by a hideous corpse that
   demanded burial and drove him from churchyard to churchyard as the dead
   rose up loathsomely in each one and refused to accommodate the newcomer
   with a berth. Yeats, undoubtedly the greatest figure of the Irish revival
   if not the greatest of all living poets, has accomplished notable things
   both in original work and in the codification of old legends.

                             X. The Modern Masters

   The best horror-tales of today, profiting by the long evolution of the
   type, possess a naturalness, convincingness, artistic smoothness, and
   skilful intensity of appeal quite beyond comparison with anything in the
   Gothic work of a century or more ago. Technique, craftsmanship,
   experience, and psychological knowledge have advanced tremendously with
   the passing years, so that much of the older work seems naive and
   artificial; redeemed, when redeemed at all, only by a genius which
   conquers heavy limitations. The tone of jaunty and inflated romance, full
   of false motivation and investing every conceivable event with a
   counterfeit significance and carelessly inclusive glamour, is now confined
   to lighter and more whimiscal phases of supernatural writing. Serious
   weird stories are either made realistically intense by close consistency
   and perfect fidelity to Nature except in the one supernatural direction
   which the author allows himself, or else cast altogether in the realm of
   phantasy, with atmosphere cunningly adapted to the visualisation of a
   delicately exotic world of unreality beyond space and time, in which
   almost anything may happen if it but happen in true accord with certain
   types of imagination and illusion normal to the sensitive human brain.
   This, at least, is the dominant tendency; though of course many great
   contemporary writers slip occasionally into some of the flashy postures of
   immature romanticism or into bits of the equally empty and absurd jargon
   of pseudo-scientific "occultism," now at one of its periodic high tides.

   Of living creators of cosmic fear raised to its most artistic pitch, few
   if any can hope to equal the versatile Arthur Machen, author of some dozen
   tales long and short, in which the elements of hidden horror and brooding
   fright attain an almost incomparable substance and realistic acuteness.
   Mr. Machen, a general man of letters and master of an exquisitely lyrical
   and expressive prose style, has perhaps put more conscious effort into his
   picaresque Chronicles of Clemendy, his refreshing essays, his vivid
   autobiographical volumes, his fresh and spirited translations, and above
   all his memorable epic of the sensitive aesthetic mind, The Hill of
   Dreams, in which the youthful hero responds to the magic of that ancient
   Welsh environment which is the author's own, and lives a dream-life in the
   Roman city of Isca Silurum, now shrunk to the relic-strown village of
   Caerleon-on-Usk. But the fact remains that his powerful horror-material of
   the nineties and earlier nineteen-hundreds stands alone in its class, and
   marks a distinct epoch in the history of this literary form.

   Mr. Machen, with an impressionable Celtic heritage linked to keen youthful
   memories of the wild domed hills, archaic forests, and cryptical Roman
   ruins of the Gwent countryside, has developed an imaginative life of rare
   beauty, intensity, and historic background. He has absorbed the mediaeval
   mystery of dark woods and ancient customs, and is a champion of the Middle
   Ages in all things -- including the Catholic faith. He has yielded,
   likewise, to the spell of the Britanno-Roman life which once surged over
   his native region; and finds strange magic in the fortified camps,
   tessellated pavements, fragments of statues, and kindred things which tell
   of the day when classicism reigned and Latin was the language of the
   country. A young American poet, Frank Belknap Long, has well summarised
   this dreamer's rich endowments and wizardry of expression in the sonnet On
   Reading Arthur Machen:

     There is a glory in the autumn wood,
     The ancient lanes of England wind and climb
     Past wizard oaks and gorse and tangled thyme
     To where a fort of mighty empire stood:
     There is a glamour in the autumn sky;
     The reddened clouds are writhing in the glow
     Of some great fire, and there are glints below
     Of tawny yellow where the embers die.
     I wait, for he will show me, clear and cold,
     High-rais'd in splendour, sharp against the North,
     The Roman eagles, and through mists of gold
     The marching legions as they issue forth:
     I wait, for I would share with him again
     The ancient wisdom, and the ancient pain.

   Of Mr. Machen's horror-tales the most famous is perhaps The Great God Pan
   (1894) which tells of a singular and terrible experiment and its
   consequences. A young woman, through surgery of the brain-cells, is made
   to see the vast and monstrous deity of Nature, and becomes an idiot in
   consequence, dying less than a year later. Years afterward a strange,
   ominous, and foreign-looking child named Helen Vaughan is placed to board
   with a family in rural Wales, and haunts the woods in unaccountable
   fashion. A little boy is thrown out of his mind at sight of someone or
   something he spies with her, and a young girl comes to a terrible end in
   similar fashion. All this mystery is strangely interwoven with the Roman
   rural deities of the place, as sculptured in antique fragments. After
   another lapse of years, a woman of strangely exotic beauty appears in
   society, drives her husband to horror and death, causes an artist to paint
   unthinkable paintings of Witches' Sabbaths, creates an epidemic of suicide
   among the men of her acquaintance, and is finally discovered to be a
   frequenter of the lowest dens of vice in London, where even the most
   callous degenerates are shocked at her enormities. Through the clever
   comparing of notes on the part of those who have had word of her at
   various stages of her career, this woman is discovered to be the girl
   Helen Vaughan, who is the child -- by no mortal father -- of the young
   woman on whom the brain experiment was made. She is a daughter of hideous
   Pan himself, and at the last is put to death amidst horrible
   transmutations of form involving changes of sex and a descent to the most
   primal manifestations of the life-principle.

   But the charm of the tale is in the telling. No one could begin to
   describe the cumulative suspense and ultimate horror with which every
   paragraph abounds without following fully the precise order in which Mr.
   Machen unfolds his gradual hints and revelations. Melodrama is undeniably
   present, and coincidence is stretched to a length which appears absurd
   upon analysis; but in the malign witchery of the tale as a whole these
   trifles are forgotten, and the sensitive reader reaches the end with only
   an appreciative shudder and a tendency to repeat the words of one of the
   characters: "It is too incredible, too monstrous; such things can never be
   in this quiet world.... Why, man, if such a case were possible, our earth
   would be a nightmare."

   Less famous and less complex in plot than The Great God Pan, but
   definitely finer in atmosphere and general artistic value, is the curious
   and dimly disquieting chronicle called The White People, whose central
   portion purports to be the diary or notes of a little girl whose nurse has
   introduced her to some of the forbidden magic and soul-blasting traditions
   of the noxious witch-cult -- the cult whose whispered lore was handed down
   long lines of peasantry throughout Western Europe, and whose members
   sometimes stole forth at night, one by one, to meet in black woods and
   lonely places for the revolting orgies of the Witches' Sabbath. Mr.
   Machen's narrative, a triumph of skilful selectiveness and restraint,
   accumulates enormous power as it flows on in a stream of innocent childish
   prattle, introducing allusions to strange "nymphs," "Dols," "voolas,"
   "white, green, and scarlet ceremonies," "Aklo letters," "Chian language,"
   "Mao games," and the like. The rites learned by the nurse from her witch
   grandmother are taught to the child by the time she is three years old,
   and her artless accounts of the dangerous secret revelations possess a
   lurking terror generously mixed with pathos. Evil charms well known to
   anthropologists are described with juvenile naivete, and finally there
   comes a winter afternoon journey into the old Welsh hills, performed under
   an imaginative spell which lends to the wild scenery an added weirdness,
   strangeness, and suggestion of grotesque sentience. The details of this
   journey are given with marvellous vividness, and form to the keen critic a
   masterpiece of fantastic writing, with almost unlimited power in the
   intimation of potent hideousness and cosmic aberration. At length the
   child -- whose age is then thirteen -- comes upon a cryptic and banefully
   beautiful thing in the midst of a dark and inaccessible wood. In the end
   horror overtakes her in a manner deftly prefigured by an anecdote in the
   prologue, but she poisons herself in time. Like the mother of Helen
   Vaughan in The Great God Pan, she has seen that frightful deity. She is
   discovered dead in the dark wood beside the cryptic thing she found; and
   that thing -- a whitely luminous statue of Roman workmanship about which
   dire mediaeval rumours had clustered -- is affrightedly hammered into dust
   by the searchers.

   In the episodic novel of The Three Impostors, a work whose merit as a
   whole is somewhat marred by an imitation of the jaunty Stevenson manner,
   occur certain tales which perhaps represent the highwater mark of Machen's
   skill as a terror-weaver. Here we find in its most artistic form a
   favourite weird conception of the author's; the notion that beneath the
   mounds and rocks of the wild Welsh hills dwell subterraneously that squat
   primitive race whose vestiges gave rise to our common folk legends of
   fairies, elves, and the "little people," and whose acts are even now
   responsible for certain unexplained disappearances, and occasional
   substitutions of strange dark "changelings" for normal infants. This theme
   receives its finest treatment in the episode entitled The Novel Of The
   Black Seal; where a professor, having discovered a singular identity
   between certain characters scrawled on Welsh limestone rocks and those
   existing in a prehistoric black seal from Babylon, sets out on a course of
   discovery which leads him to unknown and terrible things. A queer passage
   in the ancient geographer Solinus, a series of mysterious disappearances
   in the lonely reaches of Wales, a strange idiot son born to a rural mother
   after a fright in which her inmost faculties were shaken; all these things
   suggest to the professor a hideous connection and a condition revolting to
   any friend and respecter of the human race. He hires the idiot boy, who
   jabbers strangely at times in a repulsive hissing voice, and is subject to
   odd epileptic seizures. Once, after such a seizure in the professor's
   study by night, disquieting odours and evidences of unnatural presences
   are found; and soon after that the professor leaves a bulky document and
   goes into the weird hills with feverish expectancy and strange terror in
   his heart. He never returns, but beside a fantastic stone in the wild
   country are found his watch, money, and ring, done up with catgut in a
   parchment bearing the same terrible characters as those on the black
   Babylonish seal and the rock in the Welsh mountains.

   The bulky document explains enough to bring up the most hideous vistas.
   Professor Gregg, from the massed evidence presented by the Welsh
   disappearances, the rock inscription, the accounts of ancient geographers,
   and the black seal, has decided that a frightful race of dark primal
   beings of immemorial antiquity and wide former diffusion still dwell
   beneath the hills of unfrequented Wales. Further research has unriddled
   the message of the black seal, and proved that the idiot boy, a son of
   some father more terrible than mankind, is the heir of monstrous memories
   and possibilities. That strange night in the study the professor invoked
   "the awful transmutation of the hills" by the aid of the black seal, and
   aroused in the hybrid idiot the horrors of his shocking paternity. He "saw
   his body swell and become distended as a bladder, while the face
   blackened. . . ." And then the supreme effects of the invocation appeared,
   and Professor Gregg knew the stark frenzy of cosmic panic in its darkest
   form. He knew the abysmal gulfs of abnormality that he had opened, and
   went forth into the wild hills prepared and resigned. He would meet the
   unthinkable "Little People" -- and his document ends with a rational
   observation: "If unhappily I do not return from my journey, there is no
   need to conjure up here a picture of the awfulness of my fate."

   Also in The Three Imposters is the Novel of the White Powder, which
   approaches the absolute culmination of loathsome fright. Francis
   Leicester, a young law student nervously worn out by seclusion and
   overwork, has a prescription filled by an old apothecary none too careful
   about the state of his drugs. The substance, it later turns out, is an
   unusual salt which time and varying temperature have accidentally changed
   to something very strange and terrible; nothing less, in short, than the
   mediaeval vinum sabbati, whose consumption at the horrible orgies of the
   Witches' Sabbath gave rise to shocking transformations and -- if
   injudiciously used -- to unutterable consequences. Innocently enough, the
   youth regularly imbibes the powder in a glass of water after meals; and at
   first seems substantially benefited. Gradually, however, his improved
   spirits take the form of dissipation; he is absent from home a great deal,
   and appears to have undergone a repellent psychological change. One day an
   odd livid spot appears on his right hand, and he afterward returns to his
   seclusion; finally keeping himself shut within his room and admitting none
   of the household. The doctor calls for an interview, and departs in a
   palsy of horror, saying that he can do no more in that house. Two weeks
   later the patient's sister, walking outside, sees a monstrous thing at the
   sickroom window; and servants report that food left at the locked door is
   no longer touched. Summons at the door bring only a sound of shuffling and
   a demand in a thick gurgling voice to be let alone. At last an awful
   happening is reported by a shuddering housemaid. The ceiling of the room
   below Leicester's is stained with a hideous black fluid, and a pool of
   viscid abomination has dripped to the bed beneath. Dr. Haberden, now
   persuaded to return to the house, breaks down the young man's door and
   strikes again and again with an iron bar at the blasphemous semiliving
   thing he finds there. It is "a dark and putrid mass, seething with
   corruption and hideous rottenness, neither liquid nor solid, but melting
   and changing." Burning points like eyes shine out of its midst, and before
   it is dispatched it tries to lift what might have been an arm. Soon
   afterward the physician, unable to endure the memory of what he has
   beheld, dies at sea while bound for a new life in America. Mr. Machen
   returns to the daemoniac "Little People" in The Red Hand and The Shining
   Pyramid; and in The Terror, a wartime story, he treats with very potent
   mystery the effect of man's modern repudiation of spirituality on the
   beasts of the world, which are thus led to question his supremacy and to
   unite for his extermination. Of utmost delicacy, and passing from mere
   horror into true mysticism, is The Great Return, a story of the Graal,
   also a product of the war period. Too well known to need description here
   is the tale of The Bowmen; which, taken for authentic narration, gave rise
   to the widespread legend of the "Angels of Mons" -- ghosts of the old
   English archers of Crecy and Agincourt who fought in 1914 beside the
   hard-pressed ranks of England's glorious "Old Contemptibles."

   Less intense than Mr. Machen in delineating the extremes of stark fear,
   yet infinitely more closely wedded to the idea of an unreal world
   constantly pressing upon ours is the inspired and prolific Algernon
   Blackwood, amidst whose voluminous and uneven work may be found some of
   the finest spectral literature of this or any age. Of the quality of Mr.
   Blackwood's genius there can be no dispute; for no one has even approached
   the skill, seriousness, and minute fidelity with which he records the
   overtones of strangeness in ordinary things and experiences, or the
   preternatural insight with which he builds up detail by detail the
   complete sensations and perceptions leading from reality into supernormal
   life or vision. Without notable command of the poetic witchery of mere
   words, he is the one absolute and unquestioned master of weird atmosphere;
   and can evoke what amounts almost to a story from a simple fragment of
   humourless psychological description. Above all others he understands how
   fully some sensitive minds dwell forever on the borderland of dream, and
   how relatively slight is the distinction betwixt those images formed from
   actual objects and those excited by the play of the imagination.

   Mr. Blackwood's lesser work is marred by several defects such as ethical
   didacticism, occasional insipid whimsicality, the flatness of benignant
   supernaturalism, and a too free use of the trade jargon of moder
   "occultism." A fault of his more serious efforts is that diffuseness and
   long-windedness which results from an excessively elaborate attempt, under
   the handicap of a somewhat bald and journalistic style devoid of intrinsic
   magic, colour, and vitality, to visualise precise sensations and nuances
   of uncanny suggestion. But in spite of all this, the major products of Mr.
   Blackwood attain a genuinely classic level, and evoke as does nothing else
   in literature an awed convinced sense of the imminence of strange
   spiritual spheres of entities.

   The well-nigh endless array of Mr. Blackwood's fiction includes both
   novels and shorter tales, the latter sometimes independent and sometimes
   arrayed in series. Foremost of all must be reckoned The Willows, in which
   the nameless presences on a desolate Danube island are horribly felt and
   recognised by a pair of idle voyagers. Here art and restraint in narrative
   reach their very highest development, and an impression of lasting
   poignancy is produced without a single strained passage or a single false
   note. Another amazingly potent though less artistically finished tale is
   The Wendigo, where we are confronted by horrible evidences of a vast
   forest daemon about which North Woods lumbermen whisper at evening. The
   manner in which certain footprints tell certain unbelievable things is
   really a marked triumph in craftsmanship. In An Episode in a Lodging House
   we behold frightful presences summoned out of black space by a sorcerer,
   and The Listener tells of the awful psychic residuum creeping about an old
   house where a leper died. In the volume titled Incredible Adventures occur
   some of the finest tales which the author has yet produced, leading the
   fancy to wild rites on nocturnal hills, to secret and terrible aspects
   lurking behind stolid scenes, and to unimaginable vaults of mystery below
   the sands and pyramids of Egypt; all with a serious finesse and delicacy
   that convince where a cruder or lighter treatment would merely amuse. Some
   of these accounts are hardly stories at all, but rather studies in elusive
   impressions and half-remembered snatches of dream. Plot is everywhere
   negligible, and atmosphere reigns untrammelled.

   John Silence -- Physician Extraordinary is a book of five related tales,
   through which a single character runs his triumphant course. Marred only
   by traces of the popular and conventional detective-story atmosphere --
   for Dr. Silence is one of those benevolent geniuses who employ their
   remarkable powers to aid worthy fellow-men in difficulty -- these
   narratives contain some of the author's best work, and produce an illusion
   at once emphatic and lasting. The opening tale, A Psychical Invasion,
   relates what befell a sensitive author in a house once the scene of dark
   deeds, and how a legion of fiends was exorcised. Ancient Sorceries,
   perhaps the finest tale in the book, gives an almost hypnotically vivid
   account of an old French town where once the unholy Sabbath was kept by
   all the people in the form of cats. In The Nemesis of Fire a hideous
   elemental is evoked by new-spilt blood, whilst Secret Worship tells of a
   German school where Satanism held sway, and where long afterward an evil
   aura remained. The Camp of the Dog is a werewolf tale, but is weakened by
   moralisation and professional "occultism."

   Too subtle, perhaps, for definite classification as horror-tales, yet
   possibly more truly artistic in an absolute sense, are such delicate
   phantasies as Jimbo or The Centaur. Mr. Blackwood achieves in these novels
   a close and palpitant approach to the inmost substance of dream, and works
   enormous havoc with the conventional barriers between reality and
   imagination.

   Unexcelled in the sorcery of crystalline singing prose, and supreme in the
   creation of a gorgeous and languorous world of iridescently exotic vision,
   is Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, Eighteenth Baron Dunsany, whose
   tales and short plays form an almost unique element in our literature.
   Inventor of a new mythology and weaver of surprising folklore, Lord
   Dunsany stands dedicated to a strange world of fantastic beauty, and
   pledged to eternal warfare against the coarseness and ugliness of diurnal
   reality. His point of view is the most truly cosmic of any held in the
   literature of any period. As sensitive as Poe to dramatic values and the
   significance of isolated words and details, and far better equipped
   rhetorically through a simple lyric style based on the prose of the King
   James Bible, this author draws with tremendous effectiveness on nearly
   every body of myth and legend within the circle of European culture;
   producing a composite or eclectic cycle of phantasy in which Eastern
   colour, Hellenic form, Teutonic sombreness and Celtic wistfulness are so
   superbly blended that each sustains and supplements the rest without
   sacrifice or perfect congruity and homogeneity. In most cases Dunsany's
   lands are fabulous -- "beyond the East," or "at the edge of the world."
   His system of original personal and place names, with roots drawn from
   classical, Oriental, and other sources, is a marvel of versatile
   inventiveness and poetic discrimination; as one may see from such
   specimens as "Argimenes," "Bethmoora," "Poltarnees," "Camorak," "Iluriel,"
   or "Sardathrion."

   Beauty rather than terror is the keynote of Dunsany's work. He loves the
   vivid green of jade and of copper domes, and the delicate flush of sunset
   on the ivory minarets of impossible dream-cities. Humour and irony, too,
   are often present to impart a gentle cynicism and modify what might
   otherwise possess a naive intensity. Nevertheless, as is inevitable in a
   master of triumphant unreality, there are occasional touches of cosmic
   fright which come well within the authentic tradition. Dunsany loves to
   hint slyly and adroitly of monstrous things and incredible dooms, as one
   hints in a fairy tale. In The Book of Wonder we read of Hlo-Hlo, the
   gigantic spider-idol which does not always stay at home; of what the
   Sphinx feared in the forest; of Slith, the thief who jumps over the edge
   of the world after seeing a certain light lit and knowing who lit it; of
   the anthropophagous Gibbelins, who inhabit an evil tower and guard a
   treasure; of the Gnoles, who live in the forest and from whom it is not
   well to steal; of the City of Never, and the eyes that watch in the Under
   Pits; and of kindred things of darkness. A Dreamer's Tales tells of the
   mystery that sent forth all men from Bethmoora in the desert; of the vast
   gate of Perdondaris, that was carved from a single piece of ivory; and of
   the voyage of poor old Bill, whose captain cursed the crew and paid calls
   on nasty-looking isles new-risen from the sea, with low thatched cottages
   having evil, obscure windows.

   Many of Dunsany's short plays are replete with spectral fear. In The Gods
   of the Mountain seven beggars impersonate the seven green idols on a
   distant hill, and enjoy ease and honour in a city of worshippers until
   they hear that the real idols are missing from their wonted seats. A very
   ungainly sight in the dusk is reported to them -- "rock should not walk in
   the evening" -- and at last, as they sit awaiting the arrival of a troop
   of dancers, they note that the approaching footsteps are heavier than
   those of good dancers ought to be. Then things ensue, and in the end the
   presumptuous blasphemers are turned to green jade statues by the very
   walking statues whose sanctity they outraged. But mere plot is the very
   least merit of this marvellously effective play. The incidents and
   developments are those of a supreme master, so that the whole forms one of
   the most important contributions of the present age not only to drama, but
   to literature in general. A Night at an Inn tells of four thieves who have
   stolen the emerald eye of Klesh, a monstrous Hindoo god. They lure to
   their room and succeed in slaying the three priestly avengers who are on
   their track, but in the night Mesh comes gropingly for his eye; and having
   gained it and departed, calls each of the despoilers out into the darkness
   for an unnamed punishment. In The Laughter of the Gods there is a doomed
   city at the jungle's edge, and a ghostly lutanist heard only by those
   about to die (cf. Alice's spectral harpsichord in Hawthorne's House of the
   Seven Gables); whilst The Queen's Enemies retells the anecdote of
   Herodotus in which a vengeful princess invites her foes to a subterranean
   banquet and lets in the Nile to drown them. But no amount of mere
   description can convey more than a fraction of Lord Dunsany's pervasive
   charm. His prismatic cities and unheard of rites are touched with a
   sureness which only mastery can engender, and we thrill with a sense of
   actual participation in his secret mysteries. To the truly imaginative he
   is a talisman and a key unlocking rich storehouses of dream and
   fragmentary memory; so that we may think of him not only as a poet, but as
   one who makes each reader a poet as well.

   At the opposite pole of genius from Lord Dunsany, and gifted with an
   almost diabolic power of calling horror by gentle steps from the midst of
   prosaic daily life, is the scholarly Montague Rhodes James, Provost of
   Eton College, antiquary of note, and recognized authority on mediaeval
   manuscripts and cathedral history. Dr. James, long fond of telling
   spectral tales at Christmastide, has become by slow degrees a literary
   weird fictionist of the very first rank; and has developed a distinctive
   style and method likely to serve as models for an enduring line of
   disciples.

   The art of Dr. James is by no means haphazard, and in the preface to one
   of his collections he has formulated three very sound rules for macabre
   composition. A ghost story, he believes, should have a familiar setting in
   the modern period, in order to approach closely the reader's sphere of
   experience. Its spectral phenomena, moreover, should be malevolent rather
   than beneficent; since fear is the emotion primarily to be excited. And
   finally, the technical patois of "occultism" or pseudo-science ought
   carefully to be avoided; lest the charm of casual verisimilitude be
   smothered in unconvincing pedantry.

   Dr. James, practicing what he preaches, approaches his themes in a light
   and often conversational way. Creating the illusion of every-day events,
   he introduces his abnormal phenomena cautiously and gradually; relieved at
   every turn by touches of homely and prosaic detail, and sometimes spiced
   with a snatch or two of antiquarian scholarship. Conscious of the close
   relation between present weirdness and accumulated tradition, he generally
   provides remote historical antecedents for his incidents; thus being able
   to utilise very aptly his exhaustive knowledge of the past, and his ready
   and convincing command of archaic diction and colouring. A favourite scene
   for a James tale is some centuried cathedral, which the author can
   describe with all the familiar minuteness of a specialist in that field.

   Sly humourous vignettes and bits of lifelike genre portraiture and
   characterisation are often to be found in Dr. James's narratives, and
   serve in his skilled hands to augment the general effect rather than to
   spoil it, as the same qualities would tend to do with a lesser craftsman.
   In inventing a new type of ghost, he has departed considerably from the
   conventional Gothic tradition; for where the older stock ghosts were pale
   and stately, and apprehended chiefly through the sense of sight, the
   average James ghost is lean, dwarfish, and hairy -- a sluggish, hellish
   night-abomination midway betwixt beast and man -- and usually touched
   before it is seen. Sometimes the spectre is of still more eccentric
   composition; a roll of flannel with spidery eyes, or an invisible entity
   which moulds itself in bedding and shows a face of crumpled linen. Dr.
   James has, it is clear, an intelligent and scientific knowledge of human
   nerves and feelings; and knows just how to apportion statement, imagery,
   and subtle suggestions in order to secure the best results with his
   readers. He is an artist in incident and arrangement rather than in
   atmosphere, and reaches the emotions more often through the intellect than
   directly. This method, of course, with its occasional absences of sharp
   climax, has its drawbacks as well as its advantages; and many will miss
   the thorough atmospheric tension which writers like Machen are careful to
   build up with words and scenes. But only a few of the tales are open to
   the charge of tameness. Generally the laconic unfolding of abnormal events
   in adroit order is amply sufficient to produce the desired effect of
   cumulative horror.

   The short stories of Dr. James are contained in four small collections,
   entitled respectively Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, More Ghost Stories of
   an Antiquary, A Thin Ghost and Others, and A Warning to the Curious. There
   is also a delightful juvenile phantasy, The Five Jars, which has its
   spectral adumbrations. Amidst this wealth of material it is hard to select
   a favourite or especially typical tale, though each reader will no doubt
   have such preferences as his temperament may determine.

   Count Magnus is assuredly one of the best, forming as it does a veritable
   Golconda of suspense and suggestion. Mr. Wraxall is an English traveller
   of the middle nineteenth century, sojourning in Sweden to secure material
   for a book. Becoming interested in the ancient family of De La Gardie,
   near the village of Raback, he studies its records; and finds particular
   fascination in the builder of the existing Manor-house, one Count Magnus,
   of whom strange and terrible things are whispered. The Count, who
   flourished early in the seventeenth century, was a stern landlord, and
   famous for his severity toward poachers and delinquent tenants. His cruel
   punishments were bywords, and there were dark rumours of influences which
   even survived his interment in the great mausoleum he built near the
   church -- as in the case of the two peasants who hunted on his preserves
   one night a century after his death. There were hideous screams in the
   woods, and near the tomb of Count Magnus an unnatural laugh and the clang
   of a great door. Next morning the priest found the two men; one a maniac,
   and the other dead, with the flesh of his face sucked from the bones.

   Mr. Wraxall hears all these tales, and stumbles on more guarded references
   to a Black Pilgrimage once taken by the Count, a pilgrimage to Chorazin in
   Palestine, one of the cities denounced by Our Lord in the Scriptures, and
   in which old priests say that Antichrist is to be born. No one dares to
   hint just what that Black Pilgrimage was, or what strange being or thing
   the Count brought back as a companion. Meanwhile Mr. Wraxall is
   increasingly anxious to explore the mausoleum of Count Magnus, and finally
   secures permission to do so, in the company of a deacon. He finds several
   monuments and three copper sarcophagi, one of which is the Count's. Round
   the edge of this latter are several bands of engraved scenes, including a
   singular and hideous delineation of a pursuit -- the pursuit of a frantic
   man through a forest by a squat muffled figure with a devil-fish's
   tentacle, directed by a tall cloaked man on a neighbouring hillock. The
   sarcophagus has three massive steel padlocks, one of which is lying open
   on the floor, reminding the traveller of a metallic clash he heard the day
   before when passing the mausoleum and wishing idly that he might see Count
   Magnus.

   His fascination augmented, and the key being accessible, Mr. Wraxall pays
   the mausoleum a second and solitary visit and finds another padlock
   unfastened. The next day, his last in Raback, he again goes alone to bid
   the long-dead Count farewell. Once more queerly impelled to utter a
   whimsical wish for a meeting with the buried nobleman, he now sees to his
   disquiet that only one of the padlocks remains on the great sarcophagus.
   Even as he looks, that last lock drops noisily to the floor, and there
   comes a sound as of creaking hinges. Then the monstrous lid appears very
   slowly to rise, and Mr. Wraxall flees in panic fear without refastening
   the door of the mausoleum.

   During his return to England the traveller feels a curious uneasiness
   about his fellow-passengers on the canal-boat which he employs for the
   earlier stages. Cloaked figures make him nervous, and he has a sense of
   being watched and followed. Of twenty-eight persons whom he counts, only
   twenty-six appear at meals; and the missing two are always a tall cloaked
   man and a shorter muffled figure. Completing his water travel at Harwich,
   Mr. Wraxall takes frankly to flight in a closed carriage, but sees two
   cloaked figures at a crossroad. Finally he lodges at a small house in a
   village and spends the time making frantic notes. On the second morning he
   is found dead, and during the inquest seven jurors faint at sight of the
   body. The house where he stayed is never again inhabited, and upon its
   demolition half a century later his manuscript is discovered in a
   forgotten cupboard.

   In The Treasure of Abbot Thomas a British antiquary unriddles a cipher on
   some Renaissance painted windows, and thereby discovers a centuried hoard
   of gold in a niche halfway down a well in the courtyard of a German abbey.
   But the crafty depositor had set a guardian over that treasure, and
   something in the black well twines its arms around the searcher's neck in
   such a manner that the quest is abandoned, and a clergyman sent for. Each
   night after that the discoverer feels a stealthy presence and detects a
   horrible odour of mould outside the door of his hotel room, till finally
   the clergyman makes a daylight replacement of the stone at the mouth of
   the treasure-vault in the well -- out of which something had come in the
   dark to avenge the disturbing of old Abbot Thomas's gold. As he completes
   his work the cleric observes a curious toad-like carving on the ancient
   well-head, with the Latin motto "Depositum custodi -- keep that which is
   committed to thee."

   Other notable James tales are The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral, in which
   a grotesque carving comes curiously to life to avenge the secret and
   subtle murder of an old Dean by his ambitious successor: Oh, Whistle, and
   I'll Come to You, which tells of the horror summoned by a strange metal
   whistle found in a mediaevel church ruin; and An Episode of Cathedral
   History, where the dismantling of a pulpit uncovers an archaic tomb whose
   lurking daemon spreads panic and pestilence. Dr. James, for all his light
   touch, evokes fright and hideousness in their most shocking form, and will
   certainly stand as one of the few really creative masters in his darksome
   province.

   For those who relish speculation regarding the future, the tale of
   supernatural horror provides an interesting field. Combated by a mounting
   wave of plodding realism, cynical flippancy, and sophisticated
   disillusionment, it is yet encouraged by a parallel tide of growing
   mysticism, as developed both through the fatigued reaction of "occultists"
   and religious fundamentalists against materialistic discovery and through
   the stimulation of wonder and fancy by such enlarged vistas and broken
   barriers as modern science has given us with its intra-atomic chemistry,
   advancing astrophysics, doctrines of relativity, and probings into biology
   and human thought. At the present moment the favouring forces would appear
   to have somewhat of an advantage; since there is unquestionably more
   cordiality shown toward weird writings than when, thirty years ago, the
   best of Arthur Machen's work fell on the stony ground of the smart and
   cocksure 'nineties. Ambrose Bierce, almost unknown in his own time, has
   now reached something like general recognition.

   Startling mutations, however, are not to be looked for in either
   direction. In any case an approximate balance of tendencies will continue
   to exist; and while we may justly expect a further subtilisation of
   technique, we have no reason to think that the general position of the
   spectral in literature will be altered. It is a narrow though essential
   branch of human expression, and will chiefly appeal as always to a limited
   audience with keen special sensibilities. Whatever universal masterpiece
   of tomorrow may be wrought from phantasm or terror will owe its acceptance
   rather to a supreme workmanship than to a sympathetic theme. Yet who shall
   declare the dark theme a positive handicap? Radiant with beauty, the Cup
   of the Ptolemies was carven of onyx.
