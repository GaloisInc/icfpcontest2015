  by H. P. Lovecraft

                                  Written 1898

   "Now be good children" Said Mrs. Lee "While I am away & dont get into
   mischief". Mr. & Mrs. Lee were going off for the day & To leave The Two
   children John 10 yrs old & Alice 2 yrs old  "Yes" replied John

   As Soon as The Elder Lees were away the younger Lees went down cellar &
   began to rummage among the rubbish  little alice leaned against the wall
   watching John. As John was making a boat of barrel staves the Little girl
   gave a piercing cry as the bricks behind her crumbled away  he rushed up
   to her & Lifted her out screaming loudly  as soon as her screams subsided
   she said "the wall went away"  John went up & saw that there was a
   passage  he said to the little girl "lets come & see what this is"  "Yes"
   she said  the entered the place  they could stand up it  the passage was
   farther than they could see they  John went back upstairs & went to the
   kitchen drawer & got 2 candles & some matches & then they went back to the
   cellar passage. the two once more entered  there was plastering on the
   walls ceiling & floor  nothing was visible but a box  this was for a seat
   nevertheless they examined it & found it to contain nothing  the walked on
   farther & pretty soon the plastering left off & they were in a
   cave  Little alice was frightened at first but at her brothers assurance
   that it was "all right" she allayed her fears. soon they came to a small
   box which John took up & carried within  pretty soon they came on a
   boat  in it were two oars  he dragged it with difficulty along with
   him  soon they found the passage came to an abrupt stop  he pulled the
   obstacle away & to his dismay water rushed in in torrents  John was an
   expert swimmer & long breathede  he had just taken a breath so he tried to
   rise but with the box & his sister he found it quite impossible then he
   caught sight of the boat rising  he grasped it - - - - - -

   The next he knew he was on the surface clinging tightly to the body of his
   sister & the mysterious box  he could not imagine how the water got in but
   a new peril menaced them  if the water continued rising it would rise to
   the top  suddenly a thought presented itself. he could shut off the
   water  he speedily did this & lifting the now lifeless body of his sister
   into the boat he himself climed in & sailed down the passage  it was
   gruesome & uncanny absolutely dark his candle being put out by the flood &
   a dead body lying near  he did not gaze about him but rowed for his
   life  when he did look up he was floating in his own cellar  he quickly
   rushed up stairs with the body, to find his parents had come home  He told
   them the story

                                   * * * * *

   The funeral of alice occupied so much time that John quite forgot about
   the box-but when they did open it they found it to be a solid gold chunk
   worth about $10,000  enough to pay for anything but the death of his
   sister.
