				<p>(Supposed to be a "pome," but cast strictly in modern metre)
				<p>The vicar sat in the firelight's glow,
				<br>A volume in his hand,
				<br>And a tear he shed for the widespread woe,
				<br>And the anguish brought by the vicious foe
				<br>That overran the land.
				<p>But never a hand for his King raised he,
				<br>For he was a man of peace;
				<br>And he car'd not a whit for the victory
				<br>That must come to preserve his nation free,
				<br>And the world from fear release.
				<p>His son had buckled on his sword,
				<br>The first at the front was he.
				<br>But the vicar his valiant child ignor'd
				<br>And his noble deeds in the field deplor'd,
				<br>For he knew not bravery.
				<p>On his flock he strove to fix his will,
				<br>And lead them to scorn the fray.
				<br>He told them that conquest brings but ill;
				<br>That meek submission would serve them still
				<br>To keep the foe away.
				<p>In vain did he hear the bugle's sound
				<br>That strove to avert the fall.
				<br>The land, quoth he, is all men's ground,
				<br>What matter if friend or foe be found
				<br>As master of us all?
				<p>One day from the village green hard by
				<br>The vicar heard a roar
				<br>Of cannon that rival'd the anguish'd cry
				<br>Of the hundreds that liv'd but wish'd to die
				<br>As the enemy rode them o'er.
				<p>Now he sees his own cathedral shake
				<br>At the foemen's wanton aim.
				<br>The ancient towers with the bullets quake;
				<br>The steeples fall, the foundations break,
				<br>And the whole is lost in flame.
				<p>Up the vicarage lane file the cavalcade,
				<br>And the vicar, and daughter, and wife
				<br>Scream out in vain for the needed aid
				<br>That only a regiment might have made
				<br>Ere they lose what is more than life.
				<p>Then quick to his brain came manhood's thought.
				<br>As he saw his erring course,
				<br>And the vicar his dusty rifle brought
				<br>That the foe might at least by one be fought,
				<br>And force repaid with force.
				<p>One shot - the enemy's blasting fire
				<br>A breach in the wall cuts through,
				<br>But the vicar replies with his wakened ire;
				<br>Fells one arm'd brute for each fallen spire,
				<br>And in blood is born anew.
				<p>Two shots - the wife and daughter sink,
				<br>Each with a mortal wound,
				<br>And the vicar, too madden'd by far to think,
				<br>Rushes boldly on to death's vague brink
				<br>With the manhood he has found.
				<p>Three shots - but shots of another kind
				<br>The smoky regions rend.
				<br>And upon the foemen with rage gone blind,
				<br>like a ceaseless, resistless, avenging wind,
				<br>The rescuing troops descend.
				<p>The smoke-pall clears, and the vicar's son
				<br>His father's life has sav'd.
				<br>And the vicar looks o'er ruin done,
				<br>Ere the victory by his child was won,
				<br>His face with care engrav'd.
				<p>The vicar sat in the firelight's glow,
				<br>The volume in his hand
				<br>That brought to his hearth the bitter woe
				<br>Which only a husband and father can know,
				<br>And truly understand.
				<p>With a chasten'd mien he flung the book
				<br>To the leaping flames before,
				<br>And a breath of sad relief he took
				<br>As the pages blacken'd beneath his look -
				<br>The fool of peace no more!

				<p><i>Epilogue</i>

				<p>The reverend parson, wak'd to man's estate,
				<br>Laments his wife's and daughter's common fate.
				<br>His martial son in warm embrace enfolds,
				<br>And clings the tighter to the child he holds:
				<br>His peaceful notions, banish'd in an hour,
				<br>Will nevermore his wit or sense devour,
				<br>But steep'd in truth, 'tis now his nobler plan
				<br>To cure, yet recognize, the faults of man.
