				<h3 align="center">Ode to Selene or Diana</h3>
				<p>Immortal Moon, in maiden splendour shine;
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispense thy beams, divine Latona's child.
				<br>Thy silver rays all grosser things define,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hide harsh Truth in sweet illusion mildl.
				<p>In thy soft light, the city of unrest
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That stands so squalid in thy brother's glare,
				<br>Throws off its habit, and in silence blest,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becomes a vision, sparkling bright and fair.
				<p>The modern world,with all its care and pain
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smokey streets, the loathsome clanging mills,
				<br>Face 'neath thy breams, Selene, and again
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We dream as shepherds on Chaldea's hills.
				<p>Take heed, Diana, of my humble plea;
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convey me where my happiness can last,
				<br>Draw me against the tide of Time's rought sea,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let my sprirt rest amidst the past.
				<p>
				<h3 align="center">To the Old Pagan Religion</h3>
				<p>Olympian gods! how can I let ye go,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pin my faith to this new Christian creed?
				<br>Can I resign the deities I know,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for him who on a cross for man did bleed?
				<p>How in my weakness can my hopes depend
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one lone god, tho' mighty be his pow'r?
				<br>Why can Jove's host no more assistance lend,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Soothe my pain, and cheer my troubled hour?
				<p>Are there no dryads on these wooded mounts
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er which I oft in desolation roam?
				<br>Are there no naiads in these crystal founts
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or nereids upon the ocean foam?
				<p>Fast spreads the new; the older faith declines;
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of Christ resounds upon the air;
				<br>But my wrack'd soul in solitude repines
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gives the gods their last-received pray'r.
				<p>
				<h3 align="center">On the Ruin of Rome</h3>
				<p>How dost thou lie, O Rome, neath the foot of the <i>Teuton</i>
				<br>Slaves are they men, and bent to the will of thy conqueror;
				<br>Wither hath gone, great city, the race that gave law to all nations,
				<br>Subdu'd the East and the West, and made them bow down to thy consuls,
				<br>Knew not defeat, but gave it to all who attack'd thee?
				<p>Dead! and replac'd by these wretches who cower in confusion.
				<br>Dead! they who gave us this empire to guard and to live in,
				<br>Rome, thou didst fall from thy pow'r with the proud race that made thee,
				<br>and we, base <i>Italians</i>, enjoy'd what we could not have builded.     
				<p>
				<h3 align="center">To Pan</h3>
				<p>Seated in a woodland glen
				<br>By a shallow stream
				<br>Once I fell a-musing, when
				<br>I was lull'd into a dream.
				<p>From the brook a shape arose
				<br>Half a man and half a goat,
				<br>Hoofs it had instead of toes
				<br>And a beard adorn'd its throat.
				<p>On a set of rustic reeds
				<br>Sweetly play'd this hybrid man
				<br>Naught car'd  I for earthly needs,
				<br>For I knew that this was Pan.
				<p>Nymphs and Satyrs gather'd round
				<br>To enjoy the lively sound.
				<p>All to soon I woke in pain
				<br>And return'd to haunts of men
				<br>But in rural vales I'd fain
				<br>Live and hear Pan's pipes again
				<p>
				<h3 align="center">On the Vanity of Human Ambition</h3>
				<p>Apollo, chasing Daphen, claim'd his prize
				<br>But lo! she turn'd to wood before his eyes.
				<br>More modern swains at golden prizes aim,
				<br>And ever strive some worldly thing to claim,
				<br>Yet 'tis the same as in Apollo's case,
				<br>For, once attain'd, the purest gold seems base.
				<br>All that men seek's unworthy of the quest,
				<br>Yet seek they will, and never pause for rest.
				<br>True bliss, methinks, a man can only find
				<br>In virtuous life, and cultivated mind.
