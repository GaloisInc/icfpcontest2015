   There is in the land of Mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no stream,
   and out of which no stream flows. Ten thousand years ago there stood by
   its shore the mighty city of Sarnath, but Sarnath stands there no more.

   It is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young, before
   ever the men of Sarnath came to the land of Mnar, another city stood
   beside the lake; the gray stone city of Ib, which was old as the lake
   itself, and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold. Very odd and ugly
   were these beings, as indeed are most beings of a world yet inchoate and
   rudely fashioned. It is written on the brick cylinders of Kadatheron that
   the beings of lb were in hue as green as the lake and the mists that rise
   above it; that they had bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious
   ears, and were without voice. It is also written that they descended one
   night from the moon in a mist; they and the vast still lake and gray stone
   city lb. However this may be, it is certain that they worshipped a
   sea-green stone idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great
   water-lizard; before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous.
   And it is written in the papyrus of Ilarnek, that they one day discovered
   fire, and thereafter kindled flames on many ceremonial occasions. But not
   much is written of these beings, because they lived in very ancient times,
   and man is young, and knows but little of the very ancient living things.

   After many eons men came to the land of Mnar, dark shepherd folk with
   their fleecy flocks, who built Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the
   winding river Ai. And certain tribes, more hardy than the rest, pushed on
   to the border of the lake and built Sarnath at a spot where precious
   metals were found in the earth.

   Not far from the gray city of lb did the wandering tribes lay the first
   stones of Sarnath, and at the beings of lb they marveled greatly. But with
   their marveling was mixed hate, for they thought it not meet that beings
   of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk. Nor did they
   like the strange sculptures upon the gray monoliths of Ib, for why those
   sculptures lingered so late in the world, even until the coming men, none
   can tell; unless it was because the land of Mnar is very still, and remote
   from most other lands, both of waking and of dream.

   As the men of Sarnath beheld more of the beings of lb their hate grew, and
   it was not less because they found the beings weak, and soft as jelly to
   the touch of stones and arrows. So one day the young warriors, the
   slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen, marched against lb and slew all
   the inhabitants thereof, pushing the queer bodies into the lake with long
   spears, because they did not wish to touch them. And because they did not
   like the gray sculptured monoliths of lb they cast these also into the
   lake; wondering from the greatness of the labor how ever the stones were
   brought from afar, as they must have been, since there is naught like them
   in the land of Mnar or in the lands adjacent.

   Thus of the very ancient city of lb was nothing spared, save the sea-green
   stone idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the water-lizard. This the
   young warriors took back with them as a symbol of conquest over the old
   gods and beings of Th, and as a sign of leadership in Mnar. But on the
   night after it was set up in the temple, a terrible thing must have
   happened, for weird lights were seen over the lake, and in the morning the
   people found the idol gone and the high-priest Taran-Ish lying dead, as
   from some fear unspeakable. And before he died, Taran-Ish had scrawled
   upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of DOOM.

   After Taran-Ish there were many high-priests in Sarnath but never was the
   sea-green stone idol found. And many centuries came and went, wherein
   Sarnath prospered exceedingly, so that only priests and old women
   remembered what Taran-Ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite.
   Betwixt Sarnath and the city of Ilarnek arose a caravan route, and the
   precious metals from the earth were exchanged for other metals and rare
   cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers and all things of
   luxury that are known to the people who dwell along the winding river Ai
   and beyond. So Sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful, and sent
   forth conquering armies to subdue the neighboring cities; and in time
   there sate upon a throne in Sarnath the kings of all the land of Mnar and
   of many lands adjacent.

   The wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was Sarnath the
   magnificent. Of polished desert-quarried marble were its walls, in height
   three hundred cubits and in breadth seventy-five, so that chariots might
   pass each other as men drove them along the top. For full five hundred
   stadia did they run, being open only on the side toward the lake where a
   green stone sea-wall kept back the waves that rose oddly once a year at
   the festival of the destroying of Ib. In Sarnath were fifty streets from
   the lake to the gates of the caravans, and fifty more intersecting them.
   With onyx were they paved, save those whereon the horses and camels and
   elephants trod, which were paved with granite. And the gates of Sarnath
   were as many as the landward ends of the streets, each of bronze, and
   flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone no
   longer known among men. The houses of Sarnath were of glazed brick and
   chalcedony, each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet. With
   strange art were they builded, for no other city had houses like them; and
   travelers from Thraa and Ilarnek and Kadatheron marveled at the shining
   domes wherewith they were surmounted.

   But more marvelous still were the palaces and the temples, and the gardens
   made by Zokkar the olden king. There were many palaces, the last of which
   were mightier than any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron. So high were
   they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky;
   yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of Dother their walls showed
   vast paintings of kings and armies, of a splendor at once inspiring and
   stupefying to the beholder. Many were the pillars of the palaces, all of
   tinted marble, and carven into designs of surpassing beauty. And in most
   of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapis lazuli and
   sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials, so disposed that the
   beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers. And
   there were likewise fountains, which cast scented waters about in pleasing
   jets arranged with cunning art. Outshining all others was the palace of
   the kings of Mnar and of the lands adjacent. On a pair of golden crouching
   lions rested the throne, many steps above the gleaming floor. And it was
   wrought of one piece of ivory, though no man lives who knows whence so
   vast a piece could have come. In that palace there were also many
   galleries, and many amphitheaters where lions and men and elephants
   battled at the pleasure of the kings. Sometimes the amphitheaters were
   flooded with water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts, and then
   were enacted stirring sea-fights, or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly
   marine things.

   Lofty and amazing were the seventeen tower-like temples of Sarnath,
   fashioned of a bright multi-colored stone not known elsewhere. A full
   thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them, wherein the
   high-priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings.
   On the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the palaces;
   where gathered throngs in worship of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon, the
   chief gods of Sarnath, whose incense-enveloped shrines were as the thrones
   of monarchs. Not like the eikons of other gods were those of Zo-Kalar and
   Tamash and Lobon. For so close to life were they that one might swear the
   graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the ivory thrones. And up
   unending steps of zircon was the tower-chamber, wherefrom the high-priests
   looked out over the city and the plains and the lake by day; and at the
   cryptic moon and significant stars and planets, and their reflections in
   the lake, at night. Here was done the very secret and ancient rite in
   detestation of Bokrug, the water-lizard, and here rested the altar of
   chrysolite which bore the Doom-scrawl of Taran-Ish.

   Wonderful likewise were the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king. In the
   center of Sarnath they lay, covering a great space and encircled by a high
   wall. And they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass, through which
   shone the sun and moon and planets when it was clear, and from which were
   hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was
   not clear. In summer the gardens were cooled with fresh odorous breezes
   skilfully wafted by fans, and in winter they were heated with concealed
   fires, so that in those gardens it was always spring. There ran little
   streams over bright pebbles, dividing meads of green and gardens of many
   hues, and spanned by a multitude of bridges. Many were the waterfalls in
   their courses, and many were the hued lakelets into which they expanded.
   Over the streams and lakelets rode white swans, whilst the music of rare
   birds chimed in with the melody of the waters. In ordered terraces rose
   the green banks, adorned here and there with bowers of vines and sweet
   blossoms, and seats and benches of marble and porphyry. And there were
   many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small gods.

   Each year there was celebrated in Sarnath the feast of the destroying of
   lb, at which time wine, song, dancing, and merriment of every kind
   abounded. Great honors were then paid to the shades of those who had
   annihilated the odd ancient beings, and the memory of those beings and of
   their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses
   from the gardens of Zokkar. And the kings would look out over the lake and
   curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it.

   At first the high-priests liked not these festivals, for there had
   descended amongst them queer tales of how the sea-green eikon had
   vanished, and how Taran-Ish had died from fear and left a warning. And
   they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the
   waters of the lake. But as many years passed without calamity even the
   priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters.
   Indeed, had they not themselves, in their high tower, often performed the
   very ancient and secret rite in detestation of Bokrug, the water-lizard?
   And a thousand years of riches and delight passed over Sarnath, wonder of
   the world.

   Gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the
   destroying of lb. For a decade had it been talked of in the land of Mnar,
   and as it drew nigh there came to Sarnath on horses and camels and
   elephants men from Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadetheron, and all the cities of
   Mnar and the lands beyond. Before the marble walls on the appointed night
   were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travelers. Within
   his banquet-hall reclined Nargis-Hei, the king, drunken with ancient wine
   from the vaults of conquered Pnoth, and surrounded by feasting nobles and
   hurrying slaves. There were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast;
   peacocks from the distant hills of Linplan, heels of camels from the
   Bnazic desert, nuts and spices from Sydathrian groves, and pearls from
   wave-washed Mtal dissolved in the vinegar of Thraa. Of sauces there were
   an untold number, prepared by the subtlest cooks in all Mnar, and suited
   to the palate of every feaster. But most prized of all the viands were the
   great fishes from the lake, each of vast size, and served upon golden
   platters set with rubies and diamonds.

   Whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace, and viewed the
   crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters, others feasted
   elsewhere. In the tower of the great temple the priests held revels, and
   in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighboring lands made
   merry. And it was the high-priest Gnai-Kah who first saw the shadows that
   descended from the gibbous moon into the lake, and the damnable green
   mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a
   sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated Sarnath. Thereafter those
   in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water,
   and saw that the gray rock Akurion, which was wont to rear high above it
   near the shore, was almost submerged. And fear grew vaguely yet swiftly,
   so that the princes of Ilarnek and of far Rokol took down and folded their
   tents and pavilions and departed, though they scarce knew the reason for
   their departing.

   Then, close to the hour of midnight, all the bronze gates of Sarnath burst
   open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain, so that
   all the visiting princes and travelers fled away in fright. For on the
   faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable, and on
   their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof. Men
   whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the
   king's banquet-hall, where through the windows were seen no longer the
   forms of Nargis-Hei and his nobles and slaves, but a horde of
   indescribable green voiceless things with bulging eyes, pouting, flabby
   lips, and curious ears; things which danced horribly, bearing in their
   paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds and containing uncouth
   flames. And the princes and travelers, as they fled from the doomed city
   of Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants, looked again upon the
   mist-begetting lake and saw the gray rock Akurion was quite submerged.
   Through all the land of Mnar and the land adjacent spread the tales of
   those who had fled from Sarnath, and caravans sought that accursed city
   and its precious metals no more. It was long ere any travelers went
   thither, and even then only the brave and adventurous young men of yellow
   hair and blue eyes, who are no kin to the men of Mnar. These men indeed
   went to the lake to view Sarnath; but though they found the vast still
   lake itself, and the gray rock Akurion which rears high above it near the
   shore, they beheld not the wonder of the world and pride of all mankind.
   Where once had risen walls of three hundred cubits and towers yet higher,
   now stretched only the marshy shore, and where once had dwelt fifty
   million of men now crawled the detestable water-lizard. Not even the mines
   of precious metal remained. DOOM had come to Sarnath.

   But half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol; an
   exceedingly ancient idol chiseled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great
   water-lizard. That idol, enshrined in the high temple at Ilarnek, was
   subsequently worshipped beneath the gibbous moon throughout the land of
   Mnar.
