   In relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement within this
   refuge for the demented, I am aware that my present position will create a
   natural doubt of the authenticity of my narrative. It is an unfortunate
   fact that the bulk of humanity is too limited in its mental vision to
   weigh with patience and intelligence those isolated phenomena, seen and
   felt only by a psychologically sensitive few, which lie outside its common
   experience. Men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp
   distinction betwixt the real and the unreal; that all things appear as
   they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and mental
   media through which we are made conscious of them; but the prosaic
   materialism of the majority condemns as madness the flashes of supersight
   which penetrate the common veil of obvious empricism.

   My name is Jervas Dudley, and from earliest childhood I have been a
   dreamer and a visionary. Wealthy beyond the necessity of a commercial
   life, and temperamentally unfitted for the formal studies and social
   recreation of my acquaintances, I have dwelt ever in realms apart from the
   visible world; spending my youth and adolescence in ancient and little
   known books, and in roaming the fields and groves of the region near my
   ancestral home. I do not think that what I read in these books or saw in
   these fields and groves was exactly what other boys read and saw there;
   but of this I must say little, since detailed speech would but confirm
   those cruel slanders upon my intellect which I sometimes overhear from the
   whispers of the stealthy attendants around me. It is sufficient for me to
   relate events without analyzing causes.

   I have said that I dwelt apart from the visible world, but I have not said
   that I dwelt alone. This no human creature may do; for lacking the
   fellowship of the living, he inevitably draws upon the companionship of
   things that are not, or are no longer, living. Close by my home there lies
   a singular wooded hollow, in whose twilight deeps I spent most of my time;
   reading, thinking, and dreaming. Down its moss-covered slopes my first
   steps of infancy were taken, and around its grotesquely gnarled oak trees
   my first fancies of boyhood were woven. Well did I come to know the
   presiding dryads of those trees, and often have I watched their wild
   dances in the struggling beams of a waning moon but of these things I must
   not now speak. I will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the
   hillside thickets; the deserted tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted
   family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black
   recesses many decades before my birth.

   The vault to which I refer is of ancient granite, weathered and discolored
   by the mists and dampness of generations. Excavated back into the
   hillside, the structure is visible only at the entrance. The door, a
   ponderous and forbidding slab of stone, hangs upon rusted iron hinges, and
   is fastened ajar in a queerly sinister way by means of heavy iron chains
   and padlocks, according to a gruesome fashion of half a century ago. The
   abode of the race whose scions are here inurned had once crowned the
   declivity which holds the tomb, but had long since fallen victim to the
   flames which sprang up from a stroke of lightning. Of the midnight storm
   which destroyed this gloomy mansion, the older inhabitants of the region
   sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices; alluding to what they call
   'divine wrath' in a manner that in later years vaguely increased the
   always strong fascination which I had felt for the forest-darkened
   sepulcher. One man only had perished in the fire. When the last of the
   Hydes was buried in this place of shade and stillness, the sad urnful of
   ashes had come from a distant land, to which the family had repaired when
   the mansion burned down. No one remains to lay flowers before the granite
   portal, and few care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger
   strangely about the water-worn stones.

   I shall never forget the afternoon when first I stumbled upon the
   half-hidden house of death. It was in midsummer, when the alchemy of
   nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous
   mass of green; when the senses are well-nigh intoxicated with the surging
   seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odors of the soil and the
   vegetation. In such surroundings the mind loses its perspective; time and
   space become trivial and unreal, and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric
   past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness.

   All day I had been wandering through the mystic groves of the hollow;
   thinking thoughts I need not discuss, and conversing with things I need
   not name. In years a child of ten, I had seen and heard many wonders
   unknown to the throng; and was oddly aged in certain respects. When, upon
   forcing my way between two savage clumps of briars, I suddenly encountered
   the entrance of the vault, I had no knowledge of what I had discovered.
   The dark blocks of granite, the door so curiously ajar, and the funeral
   carvings above the arch, aroused in me no associations of mournful or
   terrible character. Of graves and tombs I knew and imagined much, but had
   on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact
   with churchyards and cemeteries. The strange stone house on the woodland
   slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and its cold,
   damp interior, into which I vainly peered through the aperture so
   tantalizingly left, contained for me no hint of death or decay. But in
   that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which has
   brought me to this hell of confinement. Spurred on by a voice which must
   have come from the hideous soul of the forest, I resolved to enter the
   beckoning gloom in spite of the ponderous chains which barred my passage.
   In the waning light of day I alternately rattled the rusty impediments
   with a view to throwing wide the stone door, and essayed to squeeze my
   slight form through the space already provided; but neither plan met with
   success. At first curious, I was now frantic; and when in the thickening
   twilight I returned to my home, I had sworn to the hundred gods of the
   grove that at any cost I would some day force an entrance to the black,
   chilly depths that seemed calling out to me. The physician with the
   iron-grey beard who comes each day to my room, once told a visitor that
   this decision marked the beginning of a pitiful monomania; but I will
   leave final judgment to my readers when they shall have learnt all.

   The months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force
   the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in carefully
   guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure. With
   the traditionally receptive ears of the small boy, I learned much; though
   an habitual secretiveness caused me to tell no one of my information or my
   resolve. It is perhaps worth mentioning that I was not at all surprised or
   terrified on learning of the nature of the vault. My rather original ideas
   regarding life and death had caused me to associate the cold clay with the
   breathing body in a vague fashion; and I felt that the great and sinister
   family of the burned-down mansion was in some way represented within the
   stone space I sought to explore. Mumbled tales of the weird rites and
   godless revels of bygone years in the ancient hall gave to me a new and
   potent interest in the tomb, before whose door I would sit for hours at a
   time each day. Once I thrust a candie within the nearly closed entrance,
   but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward.
   The odor of the place repelled yet bewitched me. I felt I had known it
   before, in a past remote beyond all recollection; beyond even my tenancy
   of the body I now possess.

   The year after I first beheld the tomb, I stumbled upon a worm-eaten
   translation of Plutarch's Lives in the book-filled attic of my home.
   Reading the life of Theseus, I was much impressed by that passage telling
   of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of
   destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight.
   The legend had the effect of dispelling my keenest impatience to enter the
   vault, for it made me feel that the time was not yet ripe. Later, I told
   myself, I should grow to a strength and ingenuity which might enable me to
   unfasten the heavily chained door with ease; but until then I would do
   better by conforming to what seemed the will of Fate.

   Accordingly my watches by the dank portal became less persistent, and much
   of my time was spent in other though equally strange pursuits. I would
   sometimes rise very quietly in the night, stealing out to walk in those
   church-yards and places of burial from which I had been kept by my
   parents. What I did there I may not say, for I am not now sure of the
   reality of certain things; but I know that on the day after such a
   nocturnal ramble I would often astonish those about me with my knowledge
   of topics almost forgotten for many generations. It was after a night like
   this that I shocked the community with a queer conceit about the burial of
   the rich and celebrated Squire Brewster, a maker of local history who was
   interred in 1711, and whose slate headstone, bearing a graven skull and
   crossbones, was slowly crumbling to powder. In a moment of childish
   imagination I vowed not only that the undertaker, Goodman Simpson, had
   stolen the silver-buckled shoes, silken hose, and satin small-clothes of
   the deceased before burial; but that the Squire himself, not fully
   inanimate, had turned twice in his mound-covered coffin on the day after
   interment.

   But the idea of entering the tomb never left my thoughts; being indeed
   stimulated by the unexpected genealogical discovery that my own maternal
   ancestry possessed at least a slight link with the supposediy extinct
   family of the Hydes. Last of my paternal race, I was likewise the last of
   this older and more mysterious line. I began to feel that the tomb was
   mine, and to look forward with hot eagerness to the time when I might pass
   within that stone door and down those slimy stone steps in the dark. I now
   formed the habit of listening very intently at the slightly open portal,
   choosing my favorite hours of midnight stillness for the odd vigil. By the
   time I came of age, I had made a small clearing in the thicket before the
   mold-stained facade of the hillside, allowing the surrounding vegetation
   to encircle and overhang the space like the walls and roof of a sylvan
   bower. This bower was my temple, the fastened door my shrine, and here I
   would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and
   dreaming strange dreams.

   The night of the first revelation was a sultry one. I must have fallen
   asleep from fatigue, for it was with a distinct sense of awakening that I
   heard the voices. Of these tones and accents I hesitate to speak; of their
   quality I will not speak; but I may say that they presented certain
   uncanny differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and mode of utterance.
   Every shade of New England dialect, from the uncouth syllables of the
   Puritan colonists to the precise rhetoric of fifty years ago, seemed
   represented in that shadowy colloquy, though it was only later that I
   noticed the fact. At the time, indeed, my attention was distracted from
   this matter by another phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that I could
   not take oath upon its reality. I barely fancied that as I awoke, a light
   had been hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulcher. I do not
   think I was either astounded or panic-stricken, but I know that I was
   greatly and permanently changed that night. Upon returning home I went
   with much directness to a rotting chest in the attic, wherein I found the
   key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier I had so long stormed in
   vain.

   It was in the soft glow of late afternoon that I first entered the vault
   on the abandoned slope. A spell was upon me, and my heart leaped with an
   exultation I can but ill describe. As I closed the door behind me and
   descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone candle, I seemed to
   know the way; and though the candle sputtered with the stifling reek of
   the place, I felt singularly at home in the musty, charnel-house air.
   Looking about me, I beheld many marble slabs bearing coffins, or the
   remains of coffins. Some of these were sealed and intact, but others had
   nearly vanished, leaving the silver handles and plates isolated amidst
   certain curious heaps of whitish dust. Upon one plate I read the name of
   Sir Geoffrey Hyde, who had come from Sussex in 1640 and died here a few
   years later. In a conspicuous alcove was one fairly well preserved and
   untenanted casket, adorned with a single name which brought me both a
   smile and a shudder. An odd impulse caused me to climb upon the broad
   slab, extinguish my candle, and lie down within the vacant box.

   In the gray light of dawn I staggered from the vault and locked the chain
   of the door behind me. I was no longer a young man, though but twenty-one
   winters had chilled my bodily frame. Early-rising villagers who observed
   my homeward progress looked at me strangely, and marveled at the signs of
   ribald revelry which they saw in one whose life was known to be sober and
   solitary. I did not appear before my parents till after a long and
   refreshing sleep.

   Henceforward I haunted the tomb each night; seeing, hearing, and doing
   things I must never recall. My speech, always susceptible to environmental
   influences, was the first thing to succumb to the change; and my suddenly
   acquired archaism of diction was soon remarked upon. Later a queer
   boldness and recklessness came into my demeanor, till I unconsciously grew
   to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong
   seclusion. My formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of
   a Chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a Rochester. I displayed a
   peculiar erudition utterly unlike the fantastic, monkish lore over which I
   had pored in youth; and covered the fly-leaves of my books with facile
   impromptu epigrams which brought up suggestions of Gay, Prior, and the
   sprightliest of the Augustan wits and rimesters. One morning at breakfast
   I came close to disaster by declaiming in palpably liquorish accents an
   effusion of Eighteenth Century bacchanalian mirth, a bit of Georgian
   playfulness never recorded in a book, which ran something like this:

   Come hither, my lads, with your tankards of ale,
   And drink to the present before it shall fail;
   Pile each on your platter a mountain of beef,
   For 'tis eating and drinking that bring us relief:
     So fill up your glass,
     For life will soon pass;
   When you're dead ye'll ne'er drink to your king or your lass!

   Anacreon had a red nose, so they say;
   But what's a red nose if ye're happy and gay?
   Gad split me! I'd rather be red whilst I'm here,
   Than white as a lily and dead half a year!
     So Betty, my miss,
     Come give me a kiss;
   In hell there's no innkeeper's daughter like this!

   Young Harry, propp'd up just as straight as he's able,
   Will soon lose his wig and slip under the table,
   But fill up your goblets and pass 'em around
   Better under the table than under the ground!
     So revel and chaff
     As ye thirstily quaff:
   Under six feet of dirt 'tis less easy to laugh!

   The fiend strike me blue! l'm scarce able to walk,
   And damn me if I can stand upright or talk!
   Here, landlord, bid Betty to summon a chair;
   l'll try home for a while, for my wife is not there!
     So lend me a hand;
     I'm not able to stand,
   But I'm gay whilst I linger on top of the land!

   About this time I conceived my present fear of fire and thunderstorms.
   Previously indifferent to such things, I had now an unspeakable horror of
   them; and would retire to the innermost recesses of the house whenever the
   heavens threatened an electrical display. A favorite haunt of mine during
   the day was the ruined cellar of the mansion that had burned down, and in
   fancy I would picture the structure as it had been in its prime. On one
   occasion I startled a villager by leading him confidently to a shallow
   subcellar, of whose existence I seemed to know in spite of the fact that
   it had been unseen and forgotten for many generations.

   At last came that which I had long feared. My parents, alarmed at the
   altered manner and appearance of their only son, commenced to exert over
   my movements a kindly espionage which threatened to result in disaster. I
   had told no one of my visits to the tomb, having guarded my secret purpose
   with religious zeal since childhood; but now I was forced to exercise care
   in threading the mazes of the wooded hollow, that I might throw off a
   possible pursuer. My key to the vault I kept suspended from a cord about
   my neck, its presence known only to me. I never carried out of the
   sepulcher any of the things I came upon whilst within its walls.

   One morning as I emerged from the damp tomb and fastened the chain of the
   portal with none too steady hand, I beheld in an adjacent thicket the
   dreaded face of a watcher. Surely the end was near; for my bower was
   discovered, and the objective of my nocturnal journeys revealed. The man
   did not accost me, so I hastened home in an effort to overhear what he
   might report to my careworn father. Were my sojourns beyond the chained
   door about to be proclaimed to the world? Imagine my delighted
   astonishment on hearing the spy inform my parent in a cautious whisper
   that I had spent the night in the bower outside the tomb; my sleep-filmed
   eyes fixed upon the crevice where the padlocked portal stood ajar! By what
   miracle had the watcher been thus deluded? I was now convinced that a
   supernatural agency protected me. Made bold by this heaven-sent
   circumstance, I began to resume perfect openness in going to the vault;
   confident that no one could witness my entrance. For a week I tasted to
   the full joys of that charnel conviviality which I must not describe, when
   the thing happened, and I was borne away to this accursed abode of sorrow
   and monotony.

   I should not have ventured out that night; for the taint of thunder was in
   the clouds, and a hellish phosphoresence rose from the rank swamp at the
   bottom of the hollow. The call of the dead, too, was different. Instead of
   the hillside tomb, it was the charred cellar on the crest of the slope
   whose presiding demon beckoned to me with unseen fingers. As I emerged
   from an intervening grove upon the plain before the ruin, I beheld in the
   misty moonlight a thing I had always vaguely expected. The mansion, gone
   for a century, once more reared its stately height to the raptured vision;
   every window ablaze with the splendor of many candles. Up the long drive
   rolled the coaches of the Boston gentry, whilst on foot came a numerous
   assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighboring mansions. With this
   throng I mingled, though I knew I belonged with the hosts rather than with
   the guests. Inside the hall were music, laughter, and wine on every hand.
   Several faces I recognized; though I should have known them better had
   they been shriveled or eaten away by death and decomposition. Amidst a
   wild and reckless throng I was the wildest and most abandoned. Gay
   blasphemy poured in torrents from my lips, and in shocking sallies I
   heeded no law of God, or nature.

   Suddenly a peal of thunder, resonant even above the din of the swinish
   revelry, clave the very roof and laid a hush of fear upon the boisterous
   company. Red tongues of flame and searing gusts of heat engulfed the
   house; and the roysterers, struck with terror at the descent of a calamity
   which seemed to transcend the bounds of unguided nature, fled shrieking
   into the night. I alone remained, riveted to my seat by a groveling fear
   which I had never felt before. And then a second horror took possession of
   my soul. Burnt alive to ashes, my body dispersed by the four winds, I
   might never lie in the tomb of the Hydes! Was not my coffin prepared for
   me? Had I not a right to rest till eternity amongst the descendants of Sir
   Geoffrey Hyde? Aye! I would claim my heritage of death, even though my
   soul go seeking through the ages for another corporeal tenement to
   represent it on that vacant slab in the alcove of the vault. Jervas Hyde
   should never share the sad fate of Palinurus!

   As the phantom of the burning house faded, I found myself screaming and
   struggling madly in the arms of two men, one of whom was the spy who had
   followed me to the tomb. Rain was pouring down in torrents, and upon the
   southern horizon were flashes of lightning that had so lately passed over
   our heads. My father, his face lined with sorrow, stood by as I shouted my
   demands to be laid within the tomb, frequently admonishing my captors to
   treat me as gently as they could. A blackened circle on the floor of the
   ruined cellar told of a violent stroke from the heavens; and from this
   spot a group of curious villagers with lanterns were prying a small box of
   antique workmanship, which the thunderbolt had brought to light.

   Ceasing my futile and now objectless writhing, I watched the spectators as
   they viewed the treasure-trove, and was permitted to share in their
   discoveries. The box, whose fastenings were broken by the stroke which had
   unearthed it, contained many papers and objects of value, but I had eyes
   for one thing alone. It was the porcelain miniature of a young man in a
   smartly curled bag-wig, and bore the initials 'J. H.' The face was such
   that as I gazed, I might well have been studying my mirror.

   On the following day I was brought to this room with the barred windows,
   but I have been kept informed of certain things through an aged and
   simple-minded servitor, for whom I bore a fondness in infancy, and who,
   like me, loves the churchyard. What I have dared relate of my experiences
   within the vault has brought me only pitying smiles. My father, who visits
   me frequently, declares that at no time did I pass the chained portal, and
   swears that the rusted padlock had not been touched for fifty years when
   he examined it. He even says that all the village knew of my journeys to
   the tomb, and that I was often watched as I slept in the bower outside the
   grim facade, my half-open eyes fixed on the crevice that leads to the
   interior. Against these assertions I have no tangible proof to offer,
   since my key to the padlock was lost in the struggle on that night of
   horrors. The strange things of the past which I have learned during those
   nocturnal meetings with the dead he dismisses as the fruits of my lifelong
   and omnivorous browsing amongst the ancient volumes of the family library.
   Had it not been for my old servant Hiram, I should have by this time
   become quite convinced of my madness.

   But Hiram, loyal to the last, has held faith in me, and has done that
   which impels me to make public at least part of my story. A week ago he
   burst open the lock which chains the door of the tomb perpetually ajar,
   and descended with a lantern into the murky depths. On a slab in an alcove
   he found an old but empty coffin whose tarnished plate bears the single
   word: Jervas. In that coffin and in that vault they have promised me I
   shall be buried.
