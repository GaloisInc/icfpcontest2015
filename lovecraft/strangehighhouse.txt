   In the morning, mist comes up from the sea by the cliffs beyond Kingsport.
   White and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds, full
   of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan. And later, in still
   summer rains on the steep roofs of poets, the clouds scatter bits of those
   dreams, that men shall not live without rumor of old strange secrets, and
   wonders that planets tell planets alone in the night. When tales fly thick
   in the grottoes of tritons, and conchs in seaweed cities blow wild tunes
   learned from the Elder Ones, then great eager mists flock to heaven laden
   with lore, and oceanward eyes on tile rocks see only a mystic whiteness,
   as if the cliff's rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of
   buoys tolled free in the aether of faery.

   Now north of archaic Kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious, terrace
   on terrace, till the northernmost hangs in the sky like a gray frozen
   wind-cloud. Alone it is, a bleak point jutting in limitless space, for
   there the coast turns sharp where the great Miskatonic pours out of the
   plains past Arkham, bringing woodland legends and little quaint memories
   of New England's hills. The sea-folk of Kingsport look up at that cliff as
   other sea-folk look up at the pole-star, and time the night's watches by
   the way it hides or shows the Great Bear, Cassiopeia and the Dragon. Among
   them it is one with the firmament, and truly, it is hidden from them when
   the mist hides the stars or the sun.

   Some of the cliffs they love, as that whose grotesque profile they call
   Father Neptune, or that whose pillared steps they term "The Causeway"; but
   this one they fear because it is so near the sky. The Portuguese sailors
   coming in from a voyage cross themselves when they first see it, and the
   old Yankees believe it would be a much graver matter than death to climb
   it, if indeed that were possible. Neverthcless there is an ancient house
   on that cliff, and at evening men see lights in the small-paned windows.

   The ancient house has always been there, and people say One dwells within
   who talks with the morning mists that come up from the deep, and perhaps
   sees singular things oceanward at those times when the cliff's rim becomes
   the rim of all earth, and solemn buoys toll free in the white aether of
   faery. This they tell from hearsay, for that forbidding crag is always
   unvisited, and natives dislike to train telescopes on it. Summer boarders
   have indeed scanned it with jaunty binoculars, but have never seen more
   than the gray primeval roof, peaked and shingled, whose eaves come nearly
   to the gray foundations, and the dim yellow light of the little windows
   peeping out from under those eaves in the dusk. These summer people do not
   believe that the same One has lived in the ancient house for hundreds of
   years, but can not prove their heresy to any real Kingsporter. Even the
   Terrible Old Man who talks to leaden pendulums in bottles, buys groceries
   with centuried Spanish gold, and keeps stone idols in the yard of his
   antediluvian cottage in Water Street can only say these things were the
   same when his grandfather was a boy, and that must have been inconceivable
   ages ago, when Belcher or Shirley or Pownall or Bernard was Governor of
   His Majesty's Province of the Massachusetts-Bay.

   Then one summer there came a philosopher into Kingsport. His name was
   Thomas Olney, and he taught ponderous things in a college by Narragansett
   Bay. With stout wife and romping children he came, and his eyes were weary
   with seeing the same things for many years, and thinking the same
   well-disciplined thoughts. He looked at the mists from the diadem of
   Father Neptune, and tried to walk into their white world of mystery along
   the titan steps of The Causeway. Morning after morning he would lie on the
   cliffs and look over the world's rim at the cryptical aether beyond,
   listening to spectral bells and the wild cries of what might have been
   gulls. Then, when the mist would lift and the sea stand out prosy with the
   smoke of steamers, he would sigh and descend to the town, where he loved
   to thread the narrow olden lanes up and down hill, and study the crazy
   tottering gables and odd-pillared doorways which had sheltered so many
   generations of sturdy sea-folk. And he even talked with the Terrible Old
   Man, who was not fond of strangers, and was invited into his fearsomely
   archaic cottage where low ceilings and wormy panelling hear the echoes of
   disquieting soliloquies in the dark small hours.

   Of course it was inevitable that Olney should mark the gray unvisited
   cottage in the sky, on that sinister northward crag which is one with the
   mists and the firmament. Always over Kingsport it hung, and always its
   mystery sounded in whispers through

   Kingsport's crooked alleys. The Terrible Old Man wheezed a tale that his
   father had told him, of lightning that shot one night up from that peaked
   cottage to the clouds of higher heaven; and Granny Orne, whose tiny
   gambrel-roofed abode in Ship Street is all covered with moss and ivy,
   croaked over something her grandmother had heard at second-hand, about
   shapes that flapped out of the eastern mists straight into the narrow
   single door of that unreachable place - for the door is set close to the
   edge of the crag toward the ocean, and glimpsed only from ships at sea.

   At length, being avid for new strange things and held back by neither the
   Kingsporter's fear nor the summer boarder's usual indolence, Olney made a
   very terrible resolve. Despite a conservative training - or because of it,
   for humdrum lives breed wistful longings of the unknown - he swore a great
   oath to scale that avoided northern cliff and visit the abnormally antique
   gray cottage in the sky. Very plausibly his saner self argued that the
   place must be tenanted by people who reached it from inland along the
   easier ridge beside the Miskatonic's estuary. Probably they traded in
   Arkham, knowing how little Kingsport liked their habitation or perhaps
   being unable to climb down the cliff on the Kingsport side. Olney walked
   out along the lesser cliffs to where the great crag leaped insolently up
   to consort with celestial things, and became very sure that no human feet
   could mount it or descend it on that beetling southern slope. East and
   north it rose thousands of feet perpendicular from the water so only the
   western side, inland and toward Arkham, remained.

   One early morning in August Olney set out to find a path to the
   inaccessible pinnacle. He worked northwest along pleasant back roads, past
   Hooper's Pond and the old brick powder-house to where the pastures slope
   up to the ridge above the Miskatonic and give a lovely vista of Arkham's
   white Georgian steeples across leagues of river and meadow. Here he found
   a shady road to Arkham, but no trail at all in the seaward direction he
   wished. Woods and fields crowded up to the high bank of the river's mouth,
   and bore not a sign of man's presence; not even a stone wall or a straying
   cow, but only the tall grass and giant trees and tangles of briars that
   the first Indian might have seen. As he climbed slowly east, higher and
   higher above the estuary on his left and nearer and nearer the sea, he
   found the way growing in difficulty till he wondered how ever the dwellers
   in that disliked place managed to reach the world outside, and whether
   they came often to market in Arkham.

   Then the trees thinned, and far below him on his right he saw the hills
   and antique roofs and spires of Kingsport. Even Central Hill was a dwarf
   from this height, and he could just make out the ancient graveyard by the
   Congregational Hospital beneath which rumor said some terrible caves or
   burrows lurked. Ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes, and
   beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded
   gray cottage. Now the ridge narrowed, and Olney grew dizzy at his loneness
   in the sky, south of him the frightful precipice above Kingsport, north of
   him the vertical drop of nearly a mile to the river's mouth. Suddenly a
   great chasm opened before him, ten feet deep, so that he had to let
   himself down by his hands and drop to a slanting floor, and then crawl
   perilously up a natural defile in the opposite wall. So this was the way
   the folk of the uncanny house journeyed betwixt earth and sky!

   When he climbed out of the chasm a morning mist was gathering, but he
   clearly saw the lofty and unhallowed cottage ahead; walls as gray as the
   rock, and high peak standing bold against the milky white of the seaward
   vapors. And he perceived that there was no door on this landward end, but
   only a couple of small lattice windows with dingy bull's-eye panes leaded
   in seventeenth century fashion. All around him was cloud and chaos, and he
   could see nothing below the whiteness of illimitable space. He was alone
   in the sky with this queer and very disturbing house; and when he sidled
   around to the front and saw that the wall stood flush with the cliff's
   edge, so that the single narrow door was not to be reached save from the
   empty aether, he felt a distinct terror that altitude could not wholly
   explain. And it was very odd that shingles so worm-eaten could survive, or
   bricks so crumbled still form a standing chimney.

   As the mist thickened, Olney crept around to the windows on the north and
   west and south sides, trying them but finding them all locked. He was
   vaguely glad they were locked, because the more he saw of that house the
   less he wished to get in. Then a sound halted him. He heard a lock rattle
   and a bolt shoot, and a long creaking follow as if a heavy door were
   slowly and cautiously opened. This was on the oceanward side that he could
   not see, where the narrow portal opened on blank space thousands of feet
   in the misty sky above the waves.

   Then there was heavy, deliberate tramping in the cottage, and Olney heard
   the windows opening, first on the north side opposite him, and then on the
   west just around the corner. Next would come the south windows, under the
   great low eaves on the side where he stood; and it must be said that he
   was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the detestable house on one
   side and the vacancy of upper air on the other. When a fumbling came in
   the nearer casements he crept around to the west again, flattening himself
   against the wall beside the now opened windows. It was plain that the
   owner had come home; but he had not come from the land, nor from any
   balloon or airship that could be imagined. Steps sounded again, and Olney
   edged round to the north; but before he could find a haven a voice called
   softly, and he knew he must confront his host.

   Stuck out of the west window was a great black-bearded face whose eyes
   were phosphorescent with the imprint of unheard-of sights. But the voice
   was gentle, and of a quaint olden kind, so that Olney did not shudder when
   a brown hand reached out to help him over the sill and into that low room
   of black oak wainscots and carved Tudor furnishings. The man was clad in
   very ancient garments, and had about him an unplaceable nimbus of sea-lore
   and dreams of tall galleons. Olney does not recall many of the wonders he
   told, or even who he was; but says that he was strange and kindly, and
   filled with the magic of unfathomed voids of time and space. The small
   room seemed green with a dim aqueous light, and Olney saw that the far
   windows to the east were not open, but shut against the misty aether with
   dull panes like the bottoms of old bottles.

   That bearded host seemed young, yet looked out of eyes steeped in the
   elder mysteries; and from the tales of marvelous ancient things he
   related, it must be guessed that the village folk were right in saying he
   had communed with the mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky ever
   since there was any village to watch his taciturn dwelling from the plain
   below. And the day wore on, and still Olney listened to rumors of old
   times and far places, and heard how the kings of Atlantis fought with the
   slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in ocean's floor, and how
   the pillared and weedy temple of Poseidon is still glimpsed at midnight by
   lost ships, who knew by its sight that they are lost. Years of the Titans
   were recalled, but the host grew timid when he spoke of the dim first age
   of chaos before the gods or even the Elder Ones were born, and when the
   other gods came to dance on the peak of Hatheg-Kia in the stony desert
   near Ulthar, beyond the River Skai.

   It was at this point that there came a knocking on the door; that ancient
   door of nail-studded oak beyond which lay only the abyss of white cloud.
   Olney started in fright, but the bearded man motioned him to be still, and
   tiptoed to the door to look out through a very small peephole. What he saw
   he did not like, so pressed his fingers to his lips and tiptoed around to
   shut and lock all the windows before returning to the ancient settle
   beside his guest. Then Olney saw lingering against the translucent squares
   of each of the little dim windows in succession a queer black outline as
   the caller moved inquisitively about before leaving; and he was glad his
   host had not answered the knocking. For there are strange objects in the
   great abyss, and the seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or
   meet the wrong ones.

   Then the shadows began to gather; first little furtive ones under the
   table, and then bolder ones in the dark panelled corners. And the bearded
   man made enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously
   wrought brass candle-sticks. Frequently he would glance at the door as if
   he expected some one, and at length his glance seemed answered by a
   singular rapping which must have followed some very ancient and secret
   code. This time he did not even glance tbrough the peep-hole, but swung
   the great oak bar and shot the bolt, unlatching the heavy door and
   flinging it wide to the stars and the mist.

   And then to the sound of obscure harmonies there floated into that room
   from the deep all the dreams and memories of earth's sunken Mighty Ones.
   And golden flames played about weedy locks, so that Olney was dazzled as
   he did them homage. Trident-bearing Neptune was there, and sportive
   tritons and fantastic nereids, and upon dolphins' backs was balanced a
   vast crenulate shell wherein rode the gay and awful form of primal Nodens,
   Lord of the Great Abyss. And the conchs of the tritons gave weird blasts,
   and the nereids made strange sounds by striking on the grotesque resonant
   shells of unknown lurkers in black seacaves. Then hoary Nodens reached
   forth a wizened hand and helped Olney and his host into the vast shell,
   whereat the conchs and the gongs set up a wild and awesome clamor. And out
   into the limitless aether reeled that fabulous train, the noise of whose
   shouting was lost in the echoes of thunder.

   All night in Kingsport they watched that lofty cliff when the storm and
   the mists gave them glimpses of it, and when toward the small hours the
   little dim windows went dark they whispered of dread and disaster. And
   Olney's children and stout wife prayed to the bland proper god of
   Baptists, and hoped that the traveller would borrow an umbrella and
   rubbers unless the rain stopped by morning. Then dawn swam dripping and
   mist-wreathed out of the sea, and the buoys tolled solemn in vortices of
   white aether. And at noon elfin horns rang over the ocean as Olney, dry
   and lightfooted, climbed down from the cliffs to antique Kingsport with
   the look of far places in his eyes. He could not recall what he had
   dreamed in the skyperched hut of that still nameless hermit, or say how he
   had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet. Nor could he talk of
   these matters at all save with the Terrible Old Man, who afterward mumbled
   queer things in his long white beard; vowing that the man who came down
   from that crag was not wholly the man who went up, and that somewhere
   under that gray peaked roof, or amidst inconceivable reaches of that
   sinister white mist, there lingered still the lost spirit of him who was
   Thomas Obey.

   And ever since that hour, through dull dragging years of grayness and
   weariness, the philosopher has labored and eaten and slept and done
   uncomplaining the suitable deeds of a citizen. Not any more does he long
   for the magic of farther hills, or sigh for secrets that peer like green
   reefs from a bottomless sea. The sameness of his days no longer gives him
   sorrow and well-disciplined thoughts have grown enough for his
   imagination. His good wife waxes stouter and his children older and
   prosier and more useful, and he never fails to smile correctly with pride
   when the occasion calls for it. In his glance there is not any restless
   light, and all he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is
   only at night when old dreams are wandering. He has never seen Kingsport
   again, for his family disliked the funny old houses and complained that
   the drains were impossibly bad. They have a trim bungalow now at Bristol
   Highlands, where no tall crags tower, and the neighbors are urban and
   modern.

   But in Kingsport strange tales are abroad, and even the Terrible Old Man
   admits a thing untold by his grandfather. For now, when the wind sweeps
   boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with
   the firmament, there is broken at last that ominous, brooding silence ever
   before the bane of Kingsport's maritime cotters. And old folk tell of
   pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that swells with joys
   beyond earth's joys; and say that at evening the little low windows are
   brighter than formerly. They say, too, that the fierce aurora comes
   oftener to that spot, shining blue in the north with visions of frozen
   worlds while the crag and the cottage hang black and fantastic against
   wild coruscations. And the mists of the dawn are thicker, and sailors are
   not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward ringing is that of the
   solemn buoys.

   Worst of all, though, is the shrivelling of old fears in the hearts of
   Kingsport's young men, who grow prone to listen at night to the north
   wind's faint distant sounds. They swear no harm or pain can inhabit that
   high peaked cottage, for in the new voices gladness beats, and with them
   the tinkle of laughter and music. What tales the sea-mists may bring to
   that haunted and northernmost pinnacle they do not know, but they long to
   extract some hint of the wonders that knock at the cliff-yawning door when
   clouds are thickest. And patriarchs dread lest some day one by one they
   seek out that inaccessible peak in the sky, and learn what centuried
   secrets hide beneath the steep shingled roof which is part of the rocks
   and the stars and the ancient fears of Kingsport. That those venturesome
   youths will come back they do not doubt, but they think a light may be
   gone from their eyes, and a will from their hearts. And they do not wish
   quaint Kingsport with its climbing lanes and archaic gables to drag
   listless down the years while voice by voice the laughing chorus grows
   stronger and wilder in that unknown and terrible eyrie where mists and the
   dreams of mists stop to rest on their way from the sea to the skies.

   They do not wish the souls of their young men to leave the pleasant
   hearths and gambrel-roofed taverns of old Kingsport, nor do they wish the
   laughter and song in that high rocky place to grow louder. For as the
   voice which has come has brought fresh mists from the sea and from the
   north fresh lights, so do they say that still other voices will bring more
   mists and more lights, till perhaps the olden gods (whose existence they
   hint only in whispers for fear the Congregational parson shall hear} may
   come out of the deep and from unknown Kadath in the cold waste and make
   their dwelling on that evilly appropriate crag so close to the gentle
   hills and valleys of quiet, simple fisher folk. This they do not wish, for
   to plain people things not of earth are unwelcome; and besides, the
   Terrible Old Man often recalls what Olney said about a knock that the lone
   dweller feared, and a shape seen black and inquisitive against the mist
   through those queer translucent windows of leaded bull's-eyes.

   All these things, however, the Elder Ones only may decide; and meanwhile
   the morning mist still comes up by that lovely vertiginous peak with the
   steep ancient house, that gray, low-eaved house where none is seen but
   where evening brings furtive lights while the north wind tells of strange
   revels. white and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the
   clouds, full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan. And when
   tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conchs in seaweed cities
   blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones, then great eager vapors flock
   to heaven laden with lore; and Kingsport, nestling uneasy in its lesser
   cliffs below that awesome hanging sentinel of rock, sees oceanward only a
   mystic whiteness, as if the cliff's rim were the rim of all earth, and the
   solemn bells of the buoys tolled free in the aether of faery.
