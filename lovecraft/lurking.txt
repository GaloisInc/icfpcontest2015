   There was thunder in the air on the night I went to the deserted mansion
   atop Tempest Mountain to find the lurking fear. I was not alone, for
   foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the grotesque and the
   terrible which has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors
   in literature and in life. With me were two faithful and muscular men for
   whom I had sent when the time came; men long associated with me in my
   ghastly explorations because of their peculiar fitness.

   We had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who still
   lingered about after the eldritch panic of a month before - the nightmare
   creeping death. Later, I thought, they might aid me; but I did not want
   them then. Would to God I had let them share the search, that I might not
   have had to bear the secret alone so long; to bear it alone for fear the
   world would call me mad or go mad itself at the demon implications of the
   thing. Now that I am telling it anyway, lest the brooding make me a
   maniac, I wish I had never concealed it. For I, and I only, know what
   manner of fear lurked on that spectral and desolate mountain.

   In a small motor-car we covered the miles of primeval forest and hill
   until the wooded ascent checked it. The country bore an aspect more than
   usually sinister as we viewed it by night and without the accustomed
   crowds of investigators, so that we were often tempted to use the
   acetylene headlight despite the attention it might attract. It was not a
   wholesome landscape after dark, and I believe I would have noticed its
   morbidity even had I been ignorant of the terror that stalked there. Of
   wild creatures there were none-they are wise when death leers close. The
   ancient lightning-scarred trees seemed unnaturally large and twisted, and
   the other vegetation unnaturally thick and feverish, while curious mounds
   and hummocks in the weedy, fulgurite-pitted earth reminded me of snakes
   and dead men's skulls swelled to gigantic proportions.

   Fear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century. This I
   learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first
   brought the region to the world's notice. The place is a remote, lonely
   elevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch civilization once
   feebly and transiently penetrated, leaving behind as it receded only a few
   mined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful
   hamlets on isolated slopes. Normal beings seldom visited the locality till
   the state police were formed, and even now only infrequent troopers patrol
   it. The fear, however, is an old tradition throughout the neighboring
   villages; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor
   mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade handwoven baskets for
   such primitive necessities as they cannot shoot, raise, or make.

   The lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted Martense mansion, which
   crowned the high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent
   thunderstorms gave it the name of Tempest Mountain. For over a hundred
   years the antique, grove-circled stone house had been the subject of
   stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous; stories of a silent
   colossal creeping death which stalked abroad in summer. With whimpering
   insistence the squatters told tales of a demon which seized lone wayfarers
   after dark, either carrying them off or leaving them in a frightful state
   of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they whispered of blood trails
   toward the distant mansion. Some said the thunder called the lurking fear
   out of its habitation, while others said the thunder was its voice.

   No one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting
   stories, with their incoherent, extravagant descriptions of the
   hall-glimpsed fiend; yet not a farmer or villager doubted that the
   Martense mansion was ghoulishly haunted. Local history forbade such a
   doubt, although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such investigators
   as had visited the building after some especially vivid tale of the
   squatters. Grandmothers told strange myths of the Martense spectre; myths
   concerning the Martense family itself, its queer hereditary dissimilarity
   of eyes, its long, unnatural annals, and the murder which had cursed it.

   The terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous
   confirmation of the mountaineers' wildest legends. One summer night, after
   a thunderstorm of unprecedented violence, the countryside was aroused by a
   squatter stampede which no mere delusion could create. The pitiful throngs
   of natives shrieked and whined of the unnamable horror which had descended
   upon them, and they were not doubted. They had not seen it, but had heard
   such cries from one of their hamlets that they knew a creeping death had
   come.

   In the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering
   mountaineers to the place where they said the death had come. Death was
   indeed there. The ground under one of the squatter's villages had caved in
   after a lightning stroke, destroying several of the malodorous shanties;
   but upon this property damage was superimposed an organic devastation
   which paled it to insignificance. Of a possible seventy-five natives who
   had inhabited this spot, not one living specimen was visible. The
   disordered earth was covered with blood and human debris bespeaking too
   vividly the ravages of demon teeth and talons; yet no visible trail led
   away from the carnage. That some hideous animal must be the cause,
   everyone quickly agreed; nor did any tongue now revive the charge that
   such cryptic deaths formed merely the sordid murders common in decadent
   communities. That charge was revived only when about twenty-five of the
   estimated population were found missing from the dead; and even then it
   was hard to explain the murder of fifty by half that number. But the fact
   remained that on a summer night a bolt had come out of the heavens and
   left a dead village whose corpses were horribly mangled, chewed, and
   clawed.

   The excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the haunted
   Martense mansion, though the localities were over three miles apart. The
   troopers were more skeptical; including the mansion only casually in their
   investigations, and dropping it altogether when they found it thoroughly
   deserted. Country and village people, however I canvassed the place with
   infinite care; overturning everything in the house, sounding ponds and
   brooks, beating down bushes, and ransacking the nearby forests. All was in
   vain; the death that had come had left no trace save destruction itself.

   By the second day of the search the affair was fully treated by the
   newspapers, whose reporters overran Tempest Mountain. They described it in
   much detail, and with many interviews to elucidate the horror's history as
   told by local grandams. I followed the accounts languidly at first, for I
   am a connoisseur in horrors; but after a week I detected an atmosphere
   which stirred me oddly, so that on August 5th, 1921, I registered among
   the reporters who crowded the hotel at Lefferts Corners, nearest village
   to Tempest Mountain and acknowledged headquarters of the searchers. Three
   weeks more, and the dispersal of the reporters left me free to begin a
   terrible exploration based on the minute inquiries and surveying with
   which I had meanwhile busied myself.

   So on this summer night, while distant thunder rumbled, I left a silent
   motor-car and tramped with two armed companions up the last mound-covered
   reaches of Tempest Mountain, casting the beams of an electric torch on the
   spectral grey walls that began to appear through giant oaks ahead. In this
   morbid night solitude and feeble shifting illumination, the vast boxlike
   pile displayed obscure hints of terror which day could not uncover; yet I
   did not hesitate, since I had come with fierce resolution to test an idea.
   I believed that the thunder called the death-demon out of some fearsome
   secret place; and be that demon solid entity or vaporous pestilence, I
   meant to see it.

   I had thoroughly searched the ruin before, hence knew my plan well;
   choosing as the seat of my vigil the old room of Jan Martense, whose
   murder looms so great in the rural legends. I felt subtly that the
   apartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes. The chamber,
   measuring about twenty feet square, contained like the other rooms some
   rubbish which had once been furniture. It lay on the second story, on the
   southeast corner of the house, and had an immense east window and narrow
   south window, both devoid of panes or shutters. Opposite the large window
   was an enormous Dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles representing the
   prodigal son, and opposite the narrow window was a spacious bed built into
   the wall.

   As the tree-muffled thunder grew louder, I arranged my plan's details.
   First I fastened side by side to the ledge of the large window three rope
   ladders which I had brought with me. I knew they reached a suitable spot
   on the grass outside, for I had tested them. Then the three of us dragged
   from another room a wide four-poster bedstead, crowding it laterally
   against the window. Having strewn it with fir boughs, all now rested on it
   with drawn automatics, two relaxing while the third watched. From whatever
   direction the demon might come, our potential escape was provided. If it
   came from within the house, we had the window ladders; if from outside the
   door and the stairs. We did not think, judging from precedent, that it
   would pursue us far even at worst.

   I watched from midnight to one o'clock, when in spite of the sinister
   house, the unprotected window, and the approaching thunder and lightning,
   I felt singularly drowsy. I was between my two companions, George Bennett
   being toward the window and William Tobey toward the fireplace. Bennett
   was asleep, having apparently felt the same anomalous drowsiness which
   affected me, so I designated Tobey for the next watch although even he was
   nodding. It is curious how intently I had been watching the fireplace.

   The increasing thunder must have affected my dreams, for in the brief time
   I slept there came to me apocalyptic visions. Once I partly awaked,
   probably because the sleeper toward the window had restlessly flung an arm
   across my chest. I was not sufficiently awake to see whether Tobey was
   attending to his duties as sentinel, but felt a distinct anxiety on that
   score. Never before had the presence of evil so poignantly oppressed me.
   Later I must have dropped asleep again, for it was out of a phantasmal
   chaos that my mind leaped when the night grew hideous with shrieks beyond
   anything in my former experience or imagination.

   In that shrieking the inmost soul of human fear and agony clawed
   hopelessly and insanely at the ebony gates of oblivion. I awoke to red
   madness and the mockery of diabolism, as farther and farther down
   inconceivable vistas that phobic and crystalline anguish retreated and
   reverberated. There was no light, but I knew from the empty space at my
   right that Tobey was gone, God alone knew whither. Across my chest still
   lay the heavy arm of the sleeper at my left.

   Then came the devastating stroke of lightning which shook the whole
   mountain, lit the darkest crypts of the hoary grove, and splintered the
   patriarch of the twisted trees. In the demon flash of a monstrous fireball
   the sleeper started up suddenly while the glare from beyond the window
   threw his shadow vividly upon the chimney above the fireplace from which
   my eyes had never strayed. That I am still alive and sane, is a marvel I
   cannot fathom. I cannot fathom it, for the shadow on that chimney was not
   that of George Bennett or of any other human creature, but a blasphemous
   abnormality from hell's nethermost craters; a nameless, shapeless
   abomination which no mind could fully grasp and no pen even partly
   describe. In another second I was alone in the accursed mansion, shivering
   and gibbering. George Bennett and William Tobey had left no trace, not
   even of a struggle. They were never heard of again.

                           II. A Passer In The Storm

   Vol. 3, No. 1 (February 1923), p. 18-23;

   For days after that hideous experience in the forest-swathed mansion I lay
   nervously exhausted in my hotel room at Lefferts Corners. I do not
   remember exactly how I managed to reach the motor-car, start it, and slip
   unobserved back to the village; for I retain no distinct impression save
   of wild-armed titan trees, demoniac mutterings of thunder, and Charonian
   shadows athwart the low mounds that dotted and streaked the region.

   As I shivered and brooded on the casting of that brain-blasting shadow, I
   knew that I had at last pried out one of earth's supreme horrors - one of
   those nameless blights of outer voids whose faint demon scratchings we
   sometimes hear on the farthest rim of space, yet from which our own finite
   vision has given us a merciful immunity. The shadow I had seen, I hardly
   dared to analyse or identify. Something had lain between me and the window
   that night, but I shuddered whenever I could not cast off the instinct to
   classify it. If it had only snarled, or bayed, or laughed titteringly-even
   that would have relieved the abysmal hideousness. But it was so silent. It
   had rested a heavy arm or foreleg on my chest...

   Obviously it was organic, or had once been organic... Jan Martense, whose
   room I had invaded, was buried in the grave-yard near the mansion... I
   must find Bennett and Tobey, if they lived... why had it picked them, and
   left me for the last?... Drowsiness is so stifling, and dreams are so
   horrible...

   In a short time I realised that I must tell my story to someone or break
   down completely. I had already decided not to abandon the quest for the
   lurking fear, for in my rash ignorance it seemed to me that uncertainty
   was worse than enlightenment, however terrible the latter might prove to
   be. Accordingly I resolved in my mind the best course to pursue; whom to
   select for my confidences, and how to track down the thing which had
   obliterated two men and cast a nightmare shadow.

   My chief acquaintances at Lefferts Corners had been the affable reporters,
   of whom several had still remained to collect final echoes of the tragedy.
   It was from these that I determined to choose a colleague, and the more I
   reflected the more my preference inclined toward one Arthur Munroe, a
   dark, lean man of about thirty-five, whose education, taste, intelligence,
   and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional
   ideas and experiences.

   On an afternoon in early September, Arthur Munroe listened to my story. I
   saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic, and
   when I had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest
   shrewdness and judgement. His advice, moreover, was eminently practical;
   for he recommended a postponement of operations at the Martense mansion
   until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and
   geographical data. On his initiative we combed the countryside for
   information regarding the terrible Martense family, and discovered a man
   who possessed a marvelously illuminating ancestral diary. We also talked
   at length with such of the mountain mongrels as had not fled from the
   terror and confusion to remoter slopes, and arranged to precede our
   culminating task with the exhaustive and definitive examination of spots
   associated with the various tragedies of squatter legend.

   As to the nature and appearance of the lurking fear, nothing could be
   gained from the scared and witless shanty-dwellers. In the same breath
   they called it a snake and a giant, a thunder-devil and a bat, a vulture
   and a walking tree. We did, however, deem ourselves justified in assuming
   that it was a living organism highly susceptible to electrical storms; and
   although certain of the stories suggested wings,, we believed that its
   aversion for open spaces made land locomotion a more probably theory. The
   only thing really incompativle with the latter view was the rapidity with
   which the creature must have travelled in order to perform all the deeds
   attributed to it.

   When we came to know the squatters better, we found them curiously
   likeable in many ways. Simple animals they were, gently descending the
   evolutionary scale because of their unfortunate ancestry and stultifying
   isolation. They feared outsiders, but slowly grew accustomed to us;
   finally helping vastly when we beat down all the thickets and tore out all
   the partitions of the mansion in our search for the lurking fear. When we
   asked them to help us find Bennett and Tobey they were truly distressed;
   for they wanted to help us, yet knew that these victims had gone as wholly
   out of the world as their own missing people. That great numbers of them
   had actually been killed and removed, just as the wild animals had long
   been exterminated, we were of course thoroughly convinced; and we waited
   apprehensively for further tragedies to occur.

   By the middle of October we were puzzled by our lack of progress. Owing to
   the clear nights no demoniac aggressions had taken place, and the
   completeness of our vain searches of house and country almost drove us to
   regard the lurking fear as a non-material agency. We feared that the cold
   weather would come on and halt our explorations, for all agreed that the
   demon was generally quiet in winter. Thus there was a kind of haste and
   desperation in our last daylight canvass of the horror-visited hamlet; a
   hamlet now deserted because of the squatters* fears.

   The ill-fated squatter hamlet had borne no name, but had long stood in a
   sheltered though treeless cleft between two elevations called respectively
   Cone Mountain and Maple Hill. It was closer to Maple Hill than to Cone
   Mountain, some of the crude abodes indeed being dugouts on the side of the
   former eminence. Geographically it lay about two miles northwest of the
   base of Tempest Mountain, and three miles from the oak-girt mansion. Of
   the distance between the hamlet and the mansion, fully two miles and a
   quarter on the hamlet*s side was entirely open country; the plain being of
   fairly level character save for some of the low snakelike mounds, and
   having as vegetation only grass and scattered weeds. Considering this
   topography, we had finally concluded that the demon must have come by way
   of Cone Mountain, a wooded southern prolongation of which ran to within a
   short distance of the westernmost spur of Tempest Mountain. The upheaval
   of ground we traced conclusively to a landslide from Maple Hill, a tall
   lone splintered tree on whose side had been the striking point of the
   thunderbolt which summoned the fiend.

   As for the twentieth time or more Arthur Monroe and I went minutely over
   every inch of the violated village, we were filled with a certain
   discouragement coupled with vague and novel fears. It was acutely uncanny,
   even when frightful and uncanny things were common, to encounter so
   blankly clueless a scene after such overwhelming occurrences; and we moved
   about beneath the leaden, darkening sky with that tragic directionless
   zeal which results from a combined sense of futility and necessity of
   action. Our care was gravely minute; every cottage was again entered,
   every hillside dugout again searched for bodies, every thorny foot of
   adjacent slope again scanned for dens and caves, but all without result.
   And yet, as I have said, vague new fears hovered menacingly over us; as if
   giant bat-winged gryphons looked on transcosmic gulfs.

   As the afternoon advanced, it became increasingly difficult to see; and we
   heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over Tempest Mountain. This
   sound in such a locality naturally stirred us, though less than it would
   have done at night. As it was, we hoped desperately that the storm would
   last until well after dark; and with that hope turned from our aimless
   hillside searching toward the nearest inhabited hamlet to gather a body of
   squatters as helpers in the investigation. Timid as they were, a few of
   the younger men were sufficiently inspired by our protective leadership to
   promise such help.

   We had hardly more than turned, however, when there descended such a
   blinding sheet of torrential rain that shelter became imperative. The
   extreme, almost nocturnal darkness of the sky caused us to stumble badly,
   but guided by the frequent flashes of lightning and by our minute
   knowledge of the hamlet we soon reached the least porous cabin of the lot;
   an heterogeneous combination of logs and boards whose still existing door
   and single tiny window both faced Maple Hill. Barring the door after us
   against the fury of the wind and rain, we put in place the crude window
   shutter which our frequent searches had taught us where to find. It was
   dismal sitting there on rickety boxes in the pitchy darkness, but we
   smoked pipes and occasionally flashed our pocket lamps about. Now and then
   we could see the lightning through cracks in the wall; the afternoon was
   so incredibly dark that each flash was extremely vivid.

   The stormy vigil reminded me shudderingly of my ghastly night on Tempest
   Mountain. My mind turned to that odd question which had kept recurring
   ever since the nightmare thing had happened; and again I wondered why the
   demon, approaching the three watchers either from the window or the
   interior, had begun with the men on each side and left the middle man till
   the last, when the titan fireball had scared it away. Why had it not taken
   its victims in natural order, with myself second, from whichever direction
   it had approached? With what manner of far-reaching tentacles did it prey?
   Or did it know that I was the leader, and saved me for a fate worse than
   that of my companions?

   In the midst of these reflections, as if dramatically arranged to
   intensify them, there fell nearby a terrific bolt of lightning followed by
   the sound of sliding earth. At the same time the wolfish wind rose to
   demoniac crescendos of ululation. We were sure that the one tree on Maple
   Hill had been struck again, and Munroe rose from his box and went to the
   tiny window to ascertain the damage. When he took down the shutter the
   wind, and rain howled deafeningly in, so that I could not hear what he
   said; but I waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom Nature's
   pandemonium.

   Gradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness told
   of the storm's passing. I had hoped it would last into the night to help
   our quest, but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed the
   likelihood of such a thing. Suggesting to Munroe that we had better get
   some light even if more showers came, I unbarred and opened the crude
   door. The ground outside was a singular mass of mud and pools, with fresh
   heaps of earth from the slight landslide; but I saw nothing to justify the
   interest which kept my companion silently leaning out the window. Crossing
   to where he leaned, I touched his shoulder; but he did not move. Then, as
   I playfully shook him and turned him around, I felt the strangling
   tendrils of a cancerous horror whose roots reached into illimitable pasts
   and fathomless abysms of the night that broods beyond time.

   For Arthur Munroe was dead. And on what remained of his chewed and gouged
   head there was no longer a face.

                         III. What The Red Glare Meant

   Vol. 3, No. 2 (March 1923), p. 31-37, 44, 48;

   On the tempest-racked night of November 8, 1921, with a lantern which cast
   charnel shadows, I stood digging alone and idiotically in the grave of Jan
   Martense. I had begun to dig in the afternoon, because a thunderstorm was
   brewing, and now that it was dark and the storm had burst above the
   maniacally thick foliage I was glad.

   I believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since August 5th; the
   demon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment, and
   the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an October storm. After that
   thing I had dug a grave for one whose death I could not understand. I knew
   that others could not understand either, so let them think Arthur Munroe
   had wandered away. They searched, but found nothing. The squatters might
   have understood, hut I dared not frighten them more. I myself seemed
   strangely callous. That shock at the mansion had done something to my
   brain, and I could think only of the quest for a horror now grown to
   cataclysmic stature in my imagination; a quest which the fate of Arthur
   Munroe made me vow to keep silent and solitary.

   The scene of my excavations would alone have been enough to unnerve any
   ordinary man. Baleful primal trees of unholy size, age, and grotesqueness
   leered above me like the pillars of some hellish Druidic temple; muffling
   the thunder, hushing the clawing wind, and admitting but little rain.
   Beyond the scarred trunks in the background, illumined by faint flashes of
   filtered lightning, rose the damp ivied stones of the deserted mansion,
   while somewhat nearer was the abandoned Dutch garden whose walks and beds
   were polluted by a white, fungous, foetid, over-nourished vegetation that
   never saw full daylight. And nearest of all was the graveyard, where
   deformed trees tossed insane branches as their roots displaced unhallowed
   slabs and sucked venom from what lay below. Now and then, beneath the
   brown pall of leaves that rotted and festered in the antediluvian forest
   darkness, I could trace the sinister outlines of some of those low mounds
   which characterized the lightning-pierced region.

   History had led me to this archaic grave. History, indeed, was all I had
   after everything else ended in mocking Satanism. I now believed that the
   lurking fear was no material being, but a wolf-fanged ghost that rode the
   midnight lightning. And I believed, because of the masses of local
   tradition I had unearthed in search with Arthur Munroe, that the ghost was
   that of Jan Martense, who died in 1762. This is why I was digging
   idiotically in his grave.

   The Martense mansion was built in 1670 by Gerrit Martense, a wealthy
   New-Amsterdam merchant who disliked the changing order under British rule,
   and had constructed this magnificent domicile on a remote woodland summit
   whose untrodden solitude and unusual scenery pleased him. The only
   substantial disappointment encountered in this site was that which
   concerned the prevalence of violent thunderstorms in summer. When
   selecting the hill and building his mansion, Mynheer Martense had laid
   these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year; but in
   time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to such
   phenomena. At length, having found these storms injurious to his head, he
   fitted up a cellar into which he could retreat from their wildest
   pandemonium.

   Of Gerrit Martense's descendants less is known than of himself; since they
   were all reared in hatred of the English civilisation, and trained to shun
   such of the colonists as accepted it. Their life was exceedingly secluded,
   and people declared that their isolation had made them heavy of speech and
   comprehension. In appearance all were marked by a peculiar inherited
   dissimilarity of eyes; one generally being blue and the other brown. Their
   social contacts grew fewer and fewer, till at last they took to
   intermarrying with the numerous menial class about the estate. Many of the
   crowded family degenerated, moved across the valley, and merged with the
   mongrel population which was later to produce the pitiful squatters. The
   rest had stuck sullenly to their ancestral mansion, becoming more and more
   clannish and taciturn, yet developing a nervous responsiveness to the
   frequent thunderstorms.

   Most of this information reached the outside world through young Jan
   Martense, who from some kind of restlessness joined the colonial army when
   news of the Albany Convention reached Tempest Mountain. He was the first
   of Gerrit's descendants to see much of the world; and when he returned in
   1760 after six years of campaigning, he was hated as an outsider by his
   father, uncles, and brothers, in spite of his dissimilar Martense eyes. No
   longer could he share the peculiarities and prejudices of the Martenses,
   while the very mountain thunderstorms failed to intoxicate him as they had
   before. Instead, his surroundings depressed him; and he frequently wrote
   to a friend in Albany of plans to leave the paternal roof.

   In the spring of 1763 Jonathan Gifford, the Albany friend of Jan Martense,
   became worried by his correspondent's silence; especially in view of the
   conditions and quarrels at the Martense mansion. Determined to visit Jan
   in person, he went into the mountains on horseback. His diary states that
   he reached Tempest Mountain on September 20, finding the mansion in great
   decrepitude. The sullen, odd-eyed Martenses, whose unclean animal aspect
   shocked him, told him in broken gutterals that Jan was dead. He had, they
   insisted, been struck by lightning the autumn before; and now lay buried
   behind the neglected sunken gardens. They showed the visitor the grave,
   barren and devoid of markers. Something in the Martenses' manner gave
   Gifford a feeling of repulsion and suspicion, and a week later he returned
   with spade and mattock to explore the sepulchral spot. He found what he
   expected - a skull crushed cruelly as if by savage blows - so returning to
   Albany he openly charged the Martenses with the murder of their kinsman.

   Legal evidence was lacking, but the story spread rapidly round the
   countryside; and from that time the Martenses were ostracised by the
   world. No one would deal with them, and their distant manor was shunned as
   an accursed place. Somehow they managed to live on independently by the
   product of their estate, for occasional lights glimpsed from far-away
   hills attested their continued presence. These lights were seen as late as
   1810, but toward the last they became very infrequent.

   Meanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of
   diabolic legendry. The place was avoided with doubled assiduousness, and
   invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply. It remained
   unvisited till 1816, when the continued absence of lights was noticed by
   the squatters. At that time a party made investigations, finding the house
   deserted and partly in ruins.

   There were no skeletons about, so that departure rather than death was
   inferred. The clan seemed to have left several years before, and
   improvised penthouses showed how numerous it had grown prior to its
   migration. Its cultural level had fallen very low, as proved by decaying
   furniture and scattered silverware which must have been long abandoned
   when its owners left. But though the dreaded Martenses were gone, the fear
   of the haunted house continued; and grew very acute when new and strange
   stories arose among the mountain decadents. There it stood; deserted,
   feared, and linked with the vengeful ghost of Jan Martense. There it still
   stood on the night I dug in Jan Martense's grave.

   I have described my protracted digging as idiotic, and such it indeed was
   in object and method. The coffin of Jan Martense had soon been
   unearthed-it now held only dust and nitre - but in my fury to exhume his
   ghost I delved irrationally and clumsily down beneath where he had lain.
   God knows what I expected to find-I only felt that I was digging in the
   grave of a man whose ghost stalked by night.

   It is impossible to say what monstrous depth I had attained when my spade,
   and soon my feet, broke through the ground beneath. The event, under the
   circumstances, was tremendous; for in the existence of a subterranean
   space here, my mad theories had terrible confirmation. My slight fall had
   extinguished the lantern, but I produced an electric pocket lamp and
   viewed the small horizontal tunnel which led away indefinitely in both
   directions. It was amply large enough for a man to wriggle through; and
   though no sane person would have tried at that time, I forgot danger,
   reason, and cleanliness in my single-minded fever to unearth the lurking
   fear. Choosing the direction toward the house, I scrambled recklessly into
   the narrow burrow; squirming ahead blindly and rapidly, and flashing but
   seldom the lamp I kept before me.

   What language can describe the spectacle of a man lost in infinitely
   abysmal earth; pawing, twisting, wheezing; scrambling madly through sunken
   -convolutions of immemorial blackness without an idea of time, safety,
   direction, or definite object? There is something hideous in it, but that
   is what I did. I did it for so long that life faded to a far memory, and I
   became one with the moles and grubs of nighted depths. Indeed, it was only
   by accident that after interminable writhings I jarred my forgotten
   electric lamp alight, so that it shone eerily along the burrow of caked
   loam that stretched and curved ahead.

   I had been scrambling in this way for some time, so that my battery had
   burned very low, when the passage suddenly inclined sharply upward,
   altering my mode of progress. And as I raised my glance it was without
   preparation that I saw glistening in the distance two demoniac reflections
   of my expiring lamp; two reflections glowing with a baneful and
   unmistakable effulgence, and provoking maddeningly nebulous memories. I
   stopped automatically, though lacking the brain to retreat. The eyes
   approached, yet of the thing that bore them I could distinguish only a
   claw. But what a claw! Then far overhead I heard a faint crashing which I
   recognized. It was the wild thunder of the mountain, raised to hysteric
   fury - I must have been crawling upward for some time, so that the surface
   was now quite near. And as the muffled thunder clattered, those eyes still
   stared with vacuous viciousness.

   Thank God I did not then know what it was, else I should have died. But I
   was saved by the very thunder that had summoned it, for after a hideous
   wait there burst from the unseen outside sky one of those frequent
   mountainward bolts whose aftermath I had noticed here and there as gashes
   of disturbed earth and fulgurites of various sizes. With Cyclopean rage it
   tore through the soil above that damnable pit, blinding and deafening me,
   yet not wholly reducing me to a coma. In the chaos of sliding, shifting
   earth I clawed and floundered helplessly till the rain on my head steadied
   me and I saw that I had come to the surface in a familiar spot; a steep
   unforested place on the southwest slope of the mountain. Recurrent sheet
   lightnings illumed the tumbled ground and the remains of the curious low
   hummock which had stretched down from the wooded higher slope, but there
   was nothing in the chaos to show my place of egress from the lethal
   catacomb. My brain was as great a chaos as the earth, and as a distant red
   glare burst on the landscape from the south I hardly realised the horror I
   had been through.

   But when two days later the squatters told me what the red glare meant, I
   felt more horror than that which the mould-burrow and the claw and eyes
   had given; more horror because of the overwhelming implications. In a
   hamlet twenty miles away an orgy of fear had followed the bolt which
   brought me above ground, and a nameless thing had dropped from an
   overhanging tree into a weak-roofed cabin. It had done a deed, but the
   squatters had fired the cabin in frenzy before it could escape. It had
   been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing
   with the claw and eyes.

                           IV. The Horror In The Eyes

   Vol. 3, No. 3 (April 1923), p. 35-42.

   There can be nothing normal in the mind of one who, knowing what I knew of
   the horrors of Tempest Mountain, would seek alone for the fear that lurked
   there. That at least two of the fear's embodiments were destroyed, formed
   but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this Acheron of
   multiform diabolism; yet I continued my quest with even greater zeal as
   events and revelations became more monstrous. When, two days after my
   frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes and claw, I learned that a
   thing had malignly hovered twenty miles away at the same instant the eyes
   were glaring at me, I experienced virtual convulsions of fright. But that
   fright was so mixed with wonder and alluring grotesqueness, that it was
   almost a pleasant sensation. Sometimes, in the throes of a nightmare when
   unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the
   grinning chasm of Nis, it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly
   and throw oneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dream-doom
   into whatever bottomless gulf may yawn. And so it was with the walking
   nightmare of Tempest Mountain; the discovery that two monsters had haunted
   the spot gave me ultimately a mad craving to plunge into the very earth of
   the accursed region, and with bare hands dig out the death that leered
   from every inch of the poisonous soil.

   As soon as possible I visited the grave of Jan Martense and dug vainly
   where I had dug before. Some extensive cave-in had obliterated all trace
   of the underground passage, while the rain had washed so much earth back
   into the excavation that I could not tell how deeply I had dug that other
   day. I likewise made a difficult trip to the distant hamlet where the
   death-creature had been burnt, and was little repaid for my trouble. In
   the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several bones, but apparently none
   of the monster's. The squatters said the thing had had only one victim;
   but in this I judged them inaccurate, since besides the complete skull of
   a human being, there was another bony fragment which seemed certainly to
   have belonged to a human skull at some time. Though the rapid drop of the
   monster had been seen, no one could say just what the creature was like;
   those who had glimpsed it called it simply a devil. Examining the great
   tree where it had lurked, I could discern no distinctive marks. I tried to
   find some trail into the black forest, but on this occasion could not
   stand the sight of those morbidly large boles, or of those vast
   serpent-like roots that twisted so malevolently before they sank into the
   earth.

   My next step was to reexamine with microscopic care the deserted hamlet
   where death had come most abundantly, and where Arthur Munroe had seen
   something he never lived to describe. Though my vain previous searches had
   been exceedingly minute, I now had new data to test; for my horrible
   grave-crawl convinced me that at least one of the phases of the
   monstrosity had been an underground creature. This time, on the 14th of
   November, my quest concerned itself mostly with the slopes of Cone
   Mountain and Maple Hill where they overlook the unfortunate hamlet, and I
   gave particular attention to the loose earth of the landslide region on
   the latter eminence.

   The afternoon of my search brought nothing to light, and dusk came as I
   stood on Maple Hill looking down at the hamlet and across the valley to
   Tempest Mountain. There had been a gorgeous sunset, and now the moon came
   up, nearly full and shedding a silver flood over the plain, the distant
   mountainside, and the curious low mounds that rose here and there. It was
   a peaceful Arcadian scene, but knowing what it hid I hated it. I hated the
   mocking moon, the hypocritical plain, the festering mountain, and those
   sinister mounds. Everything seemed to me tainted with a loathsome
   contagion, and inspired by a noxious alliance with distorted hidden
   powers.

   Presently, as I gazed abstractedly at the moonlit panorama, my eye became
   attracted by something singular in the nature and arrangement of a certain
   topographical element. Without having any exact knowledge of geology, I
   had from the first been interested in the odd mounds and hummocks of the
   region. I had noticed that they were pretty widely distributed around
   Tempest Mountain, though less numerous on the plain than near the hilltop
   itself, where prehistoric glaciation had doubtless found feebler
   opposition to its striking and fantastic caprices. Now, in the light of
   that low moon which cast long weird shadows, it struck me forcibly that
   the various points and lines of the mound system had a peculiar relation
   to the summit of Tempest Mountain. That summit was undeniably a centre
   from which the lines or rows of points radiated indefinitely and
   irregularly, as if the unwholesome Martense mansion had thrown visible
   tentacles of terror. The idea of such tentacles gave me an unexplained
   thrill, and I stopped to analyse my reason for believing these mounds
   glacial phenomena.

   The more I analysed the less I believed, and against my newly opened mind
   there began to beat grotesque and horrible analogies based on superficial
   aspects and upon my experience beneath the earth. Before I knew it I was
   uttering frenzied and disjointed words to myself; "My God!... Molehills...
   the damned place must be honeycombed... how many... that night at the
   mansion... they took Bennett and Tobey first... on each side of us..."
   Then I was digging frantically into the mound which had stretched nearest
   me; digging desperately, shiveringly, but almost jubilantly; digging and
   at last shrieking aloud with some unplaced emotion as I came upon a tunnel
   or burrow just like the one through which I had crawled on the other
   demoniac night.

   After that I recall running, spade in hand; a hideous run across
   moon-litten, mound-marked meadows and through diseased, precipitous
   abysses of haunted hillside forest; leaping screaming, panting, bounding
   toward the terrible Martense mansion. I recall digging unreasonably in all
   parts of the brier-choked cellar; digging to find the core and centre of
   that malignant universe of mounds. And then I recall how I laughed when I
   stumbled on the passageway; the hole at the base of the old chimney, where
   the thick weeds grew and cast queer shadows in the light of the lone
   candle I had happened to have with me. What still remained down in that
   hell-hive, lurking and waiting for the thunder to arouse it, I did not
   know. Two had been killed; perhaps that had finished it. But still there
   remained that burning determination to reach the innermost secret of the
   fear, which I had once more come to deem definite, material, and organic.

   My indecisive speculation whether to explore the passage alone and
   immediately with my pocket-light or to try to assemble a band of squatters
   for the quest, was interrupted after a time by a sudden rush of wind from
   the outside which blew out the candle and left me in stark blackness. The
   moon no longer shone through the chinks and apertures above me, and with a
   sense of fateful alarm I heard the sinister and significant rumble of
   approaching thunder. A confusion of associated ideas possessed my brain,
   leading me to grope back toward the farthest corner of the cellar. My
   eyes, however, never turned away from the horrible opening at the base of
   the chimney; and I began to get glimpses of the crumbling bricks and
   unhealthy weeds as faint glows of lightning penetrated the weeds outside
   and illumined the chinks in the upper wall. Every second I was consumed
   with a mixture of fear and curiosity. What would the storm call forth-or
   was there anything left for it to call? Guided by a lightning flash I
   settled myself down behind a dense clump of vegetation, through which I
   could see the opening without being seen.

   If heaven is merciful, it will some day efface from my consciousness the
   sight that I saw, and let me live my last years in peace. I cannot sleep
   at night now, and have to take opiates when it thunders. The thing came
   abruptly and unannounced; a demon, ratlike scurrying from pits remote and
   unimaginable, a hellish panting and stifled grunting, and then from that
   opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous and leprous life - a
   loathsome night-spawned flood of organic corruption more devastatingly
   hideous than the blackest conjurations of mortal madness and morbidity.
   Seething, stewing, surging, bubbling like serpents' slime it rolled up and
   out of that yawning hole, spreading like a septic contagion and streaming
   from the cellar at every point of egress - streaming out to scatter
   through the accursed midnight forests and strew fear, madness, and death.

   God knows how many there were - there must have been thousands. To see the
   stream of them in that faint intermittent lightning was shocking. When
   they had thinned out enough to be glimpsed as separate organisms, I saw
   that they were dwarfed, deformed hairy devils or apes-monstrous and
   diabolic caricatures of the monkey tribe. They were so hideously silent;
   there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers turned with the
   skill of long practice to make a meal in accustomed fashion on a weaker
   companion. 0thers snapped up what it left and ate with slavering relish.
   Then, in spite of my daze of fright and disgust, my morbid curiosity
   triumphed; and as the last of the monstrosities oozed up alone from that
   nether world of unknown nightmare, I drew my automatic pistol and shot it
   under cover of the thunder.

   Shrieking, slithering, torrential shadows of red viscous madness chasing
   one another through endless, ensanguined condors of purple fulgurous
   sky... formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a ghoulish,
   remembered scene; forests of monstrous over-nourished oaks with serpent
   roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an earth verminous with
   millions of cannibal devils; mound-like tentacles groping from underground
   nuclei of polypous perversion... insane lightning over malignant ivied
   walls and demon arcades choked with fungous vegetation... Heaven be
   thanked for the instinct which led me unconscious to places where men
   dwell; to the peaceful village that slept under the calm stars of clearing
   skies.

   I had recovered enough in a week to send to Albany for a gang of men to
   blow up the Martense mansion and the entire top of Tempest Mountain with
   dynamite, stop up all the discoverable mound-burrows, and destroy certain
   over-nourished trees whose very existence seemed an insult to sanity. I
   could sleep a little after they had done this, but true rest will never
   come as long as I remember that nameless secret of the lurking fear. The
   thing will haunt me, for who can say the extermination is complete, and
   that analogous phenomena do not exist all over the world? Who can, with my
   knowledge, think of the earth's unknown caverns without a nightmare dread
   of future possibilities? I cannot see a well or a subway entrance without
   shuddering... why cannot the doctors give me something to make me sleep,
   or truly calm my brain when it thunders?

   What I saw in the glow of flashlight after I shot the unspeakable
   straggling object was so simple that almost a minute elapsed before I
   understood and went delirious. The object was nauseous; a filthy whitish
   gorilla thing with sharp yellow fangs and matted fur. It was the ultimate
   product of mammalian degeneration; the frightful outcome of isolated
   spawning, multiplication, and cannibal nutrition above and below the
   ground; the embodiment of all the snarling and chaos and grinning fear
   that lurk behind life. It had looked at me as it died, and its eyes had
   the same odd quality that marked those other eyes which had stared at me
   underground and excited cloudy recollections. One eye was blue, the other
   brown. They were the dissimilar Martense eyes of the old legends, and I
   knew in one inundating cataclysm of voiceless horror what had become of
   that vanished family; the terrible and thunder-crazed house of Martense.
