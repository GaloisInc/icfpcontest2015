     Apropos of sleep, that sinister adventure of all our nights, we may say
     that men go to bed daily with an audacity that would be incomprehensible
     if we did not know that it is the result of ignorance of the danger.

                                                                 - Baudelaire

   May the merciful gods, if indeed there be such, guard those hours when no
   power of the will, or drug that the cunning of man devises, can keep me
   from the chasm of sleep. Death is merciful, for there is no return
   therefrom, but with him who has come back out of the nethermost chambers
   of night, haggard and knowing, peace rests nevermore. Fool that I was to
   plunge with such unsanctioned phrensy into mysteries no man was meant to
   penetrate; fool or god that he was - my only friend, who led me and went
   before me, and who in the end passed into terrors which may yet be mine!

   We met, I recall, in a railway station, where he was the center of a crowd
   of the vulgarly curious. He was unconscious, having fallen in a kind of
   convulsion which imparted to his slight black-clad body a strange
   rigidity. I think he was then approaching forty years of age, for there
   were deep lines in the face, wan and hollow-cheeked, but oval and actually
   beautiful; and touches of gray in the thick, waving hair and small full
   beard which had once been of the deepest raven black. His brow was white
   as the marble of Pentelicus, and of a height and breadth almost god-like.

   I said to myself, with all the ardor of a sculptor, that this man was a
   faun's statue out of antique Hellas, dug from a temple's ruins and brought
   somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of
   devastating years. And when he opened his immense, sunken, and wildly
   luminous black eyes I knew he would be thenceforth my only friend - the
   only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before - for I saw
   that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of
   realms beyond normal consciousness and reality; realms which I had
   cherished in fancy, but vainly sought. So as I drove the crowd away I told
   him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader in unfathomed
   mysteries, and he assented without speaking a word. Afterward I found that
   his voice was music - the music of deep viols and of crystalline spheres.
   We talked often in the night, and in the day, when I chiseled busts of him
   and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortalize his different
   expressions.

   Of our studies it is impossible to speak, since they held so slight a
   connection with anything of the world as living men conceive it. They were
   of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and consciousness
   which lies deeper than matter, time, and space, and whose existence we
   suspect only in certain forms of sleep - those rare dreams beyond dreams
   which come never to common men, and but once or twice in the lifetime of
   imaginative men. The cosmos of our waking knowledge, born from such an
   universe as a bubble is born from the pipe of a jester, touches it only as
   such a bubble may touch its sardonic source when sucked back by the
   jester's whim. Men of learning suspect it little and ignore it mostly.
   Wise men have interpreted dreams, and the gods have laughed. One man with
   Oriental eyes has said that all time and space are relative, and men have
   laughed. But even that man with Oriental eyes has done no more than
   suspect. I had wished and tried to do more than suspect, and my friend had
   tried and partly succeeded. Then we both tried together, and with exotic
   drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of
   the old manor-house in hoary Kent.

   Among the agonies of these after days is that chief of torments -
   inarticulateness. What I learned and saw in those hours of impious
   exploration can never be told - for want of symbols or suggestions in any
   language. I say this because from first to last our discoveries partook
   only of the nature of sensations; sensations correlated with no impression
   which the nervous system of normal humanity is capable of receiving. They
   were sensations, yet within them lay unbelievable elements of time and
   space - things which at bottom possess no distinct and definite existence.
   Human utterance can best convey the general character of our experiences
   by calling them plungings or soarings; for in every period of revelation
   some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and
   present, rushing aerially along shocking, unlighted, and fear-haunted
   abysses, and occasionally tearing through certain well-marked and typical
   obstacles describable only as viscous, uncouth clouds of vapors.

   In these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and sometimes
   together. When we were together, my friend was always far ahead; I could
   comprehend his presence despite the absence of form by a species of
   pictorial memory whereby his face appeared to me, golden from a strange
   light and frightful with its weird beauty, its anomalously youthful
   cheeks, its burning eyes, its Olympian brow, and its shadowing hair and
   growth of beard.

   Of the progress of time we kept no record, for time had become to us the
   merest illusion. I know only that there must have been something very
   singular involved, since we came at length to marvel why we did not grow
   old. Our discourse was unholy, and always hideously ambitious - no god or
   daemon could have aspired to discoveries and conquest like those which we
   planned in whispers. I shiver as I speak of them, and dare not be
   explicit; though I will say that my friend once wrote on paper a wish
   which he dared not utter with his tongue, and which made me burn the paper
   and look affrightedly out of the window at the spangled night sky. I will
   hint - only hint - that he had designs which involved the rulership of the
   visible universe and more; designs whereby the earth and the stars would
   move at his command, and the destinies of all living things be his. I
   affirm - I swear - that I had no share in these extreme aspirations.
   Anything my friend may have said or written to the contrary must be
   erroneous, for I am no man of strength to risk the unmentionable spheres
   by which alone one might achieve success.

   There was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us irresistibly
   into limitless vacua beyond all thought and entity. Perceptions of the
   most maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon us; perceptions of
   infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy, yet which are now partly
   lost to my memory and partly incapable of presentation to others. Viscous
   obstacles were clawed through in rapid succession, and at length I felt
   that we had been borne to realms of greater remoteness than any we had
   previously known.

   My friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean of
   virgin aether, and I could see the sinister exultation on his floating,
   luminous, too-youthful memory-face. Suddenly that face became dim and
   quickly disappeared, and in a brief space I found myself projected against
   an obstacle which I could not penetrate. It was like the others, yet
   incalculably denser; a sticky clammy mass, if such terms can be applied to
   analogous qualities in a non-material sphere.

   I had, I felt, been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had
   successfully passed. Struggling anew, I came to the end of the drug-dream
   and opened my physical eyes to the tower studio in whose opposite corner
   reclined the pallid and still unconscious form of my fellow dreamer,
   weirdly haggard and wildly beautiful as the moon shed gold-green light on
   his marble features.

   Then, after a short interval, the form in the corner stirred; and may
   pitying heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that which
   took place before me. I cannot tell you how he shrieked, or what vistas of
   unvisitable hells gleamed for a second in black eyes crazed with fright. I
   can only say that I fainted, and did not stir till he himself recovered
   and shook me in his phrensy for someone to keep away the horror and
   desolation.

   That was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream.
   Awed, shaken, and portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier
   warned me that we must never venture within those realms again. What he
   had seen, he dared not tell me; but he said from his wisdom that we must
   sleep as little as possible, even if drugs were necessary to keep us
   awake. That he was right, I soon learned from the unutterable fear which
   engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed.

   After each short and inevitable sleep I seemed older, whilst my friend
   aged with a rapidity almost shocking. It is hideous to see wrinkles form
   and hair whiten almost before one's eyes. Our mode of life was now totally
   altered. Heretofore a recluse so far as I know - his true name and origin
   never having passed his lips - my friend now became frantic in his fear of
   solitude. At night he would not be alone, nor would the company of a few
   persons calm him. His sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most
   general and boisterous sort; so that few assemblies of the young and gay
   were unknown to us.

   Our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which I
   keenly resented, but which my friend considered a lesser evil than
   solitude. Especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars
   were shining, and if forced to this condition he would often glance
   furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein. He did
   not always glance at the same place in the sky - it seemed to be a
   different place at different times. On spring evenings it would be low in
   the northeast. In the summer it would be nearly overhead. In the autumn it
   would be in the northwest. In winter it would be in the east, but mostly
   if in the small hours of morning.

   Midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him. Only after two years did
   I connect this fear with anything in particular; but then I began to see
   that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose
   position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glance -
   a spot roughly marked by the constellation Corona Borealis.

   We now had a studio in London, never separating, but never discussing the
   days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world. We
   were aged and weak from our drugs, dissipations, and nervous overstrain,
   and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become snow-white. Our
   freedom from long sleep was surprising, for seldom did we succumb more
   than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so
   frightful a menace.

   Then came one January of fog and rain, when money ran low and drugs were
   hard to buy. My statues and ivory heads were all sold, and I had no means
   to purchase new materials, or energy to fashion them even had I possessed
   them. We suffered terribly, and on a certain night my friend sank into a
   deep-breathing sleep from which I could not awaken him. I can recall the
   scene now - the desolate, pitch-black garret studio under the eaves with
   the rain beating down; the ticking of our lone clock; the fancied ticking
   of our watches as they rested on the dressing-table; the creaking of some
   swaying shutter in a remote part of the house; certain distant city noises
   muffled by fog and space; and, worst of all, the deep, steady, sinister
   breathing of my friend on the couch - a rhythmical breathing which seemed
   to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it
   wandered in spheres forbidden, unimagined, and hideously remote.

   The tension of my vigil became oppressive, and a wild train of trivial
   impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind. I
   heard a clock strike somewhere - not ours, for that was not a striking
   clock - and my morbid fancy found in this a new starting-point for idle
   wanderings. Clocks - time - space - infinity - and then my fancy reverted
   to the locale as I reflected that even now, beyond the roof and the fog
   and the rain and the atmosphere, Corona Borealis was rising in the
   northeast. Corona Borealis, which my friend had appeared to dread, and
   whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen
   through the measureless abysses of aether. All at once my feverishly
   sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in the
   soft medley of drug-magnified sounds - a low and damnably insistent whine
   from very far away; droning, clamoring, mocking, calling, from the
   northeast.

   But it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set
   upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed; not
   that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which caused
   lodgers and police to break down the door. It was not what I heard, but
   what I saw; for in that dark, locked, shuttered, and curtained room there
   appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible red-gold
   light - a shaft which bore with it no glow to disperse the darkness, but
   which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the troubled sleeper,
   bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful
   memory-face as I had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled
   time, when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret,
   innermost and forbidden caverns of nightmare.

   And as I looked, I beheld the head rise, the black, liquid, and
   deep-sunken eyes open in terror, and the thin, shadowed lips part as if
   for a scream too frightful to be uttered. There dwelt in that ghastly and
   flexible face, as it shone bodiless, luminous, and rejuvenated in the
   blackness, more of stark, teeming, brain-shattering fear than all the rest
   of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me.

   No word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and nearer,
   but as I followed the memory-face's mad stare along that cursed shaft of
   light to its source, the source whence also the whining came, I, too, saw
   for an instant what it saw, and fell with ringing ears in that fit of
   shrieking epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the police. Never could I
   tell, try as I might, what it actually was that I saw; nor could the still
   face tell, for although it must have seen more than I did, it will never
   speak again. But always I shall guard against the mocking and insatiate
   Hypnos, lord of sleep, against the night sky, and against the mad
   ambitions of knowledge and philosophy.

   Just what happened is unknown, for not only was my own mind unseated by
   the strange and hideous thing, but others were tainted with a
   forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not madness. They have said, I
   know not for what reason, that I never had a friend; but that art,
   philosophy, and insanity had filled all my tragic life. The lodgers and
   police on that night soothed me, and the doctor administered something to
   quiet me, nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place. My
   stricken friend moved them to no pity, but what they found on the couch in
   the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me, and now a fame
   which I spurn in despair as I sit for hours, bald, gray-bearded,
   shriveled, palsied, drug-crazed, and broken, adoring and praying to the
   object they found.

   For they deny that I sold the last of my statuary, and point with ecstasy
   at the thing which the shining shaft of light left cold, petrified, and
   unvocal. It is all that remains of my friend; the friend who led me on to
   madness and wreckage; a godlike head of such marble as only old Hellas
   could yield, young with the youth that is outside time, and with beauteous
   bearded face, curved, smiling lips, Olympian brow, and dense locks waving
   and poppy-crowned. They say that that haunting memory-face is modeled from
   my own, as it was at twenty-five; but upon the marble base is carven a
   single name in the letters of Attica - HYPNOS.
