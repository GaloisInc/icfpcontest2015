				<h3 align="center">I</h3>
				<p>Out of the reaches of illimitable night
				<br>The blazing planet grew, and forc'd to life
				<br>Unending cycles of progressive strife
				<br>And strange mutations of undying light
				<br>And boresome books, than hell's own self more trite
				<br>And thoughts repeated and become a blight,
				<br>And cheap rum-hounds with moonshine hootch made tight,
				<br>And quite contrite to see the flight of fright so bright
				<br>I used to ride my bicycle in the night
				<br>With a dandy acetylene lantern that cost $3.00
				<br>In the evening, by the moonlight, you can hear those darkies singing
				<br>Meet me tonight - in dreamland... BAH!
				<br>I used to sit on the stairs of the house where I was born
				<br>After we left it but before it was sold
				<br>And play on a zobo with two other boys.
				<br>We called ourselves the Blackstone Military Band
				<br>Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?
				<br>In the spring of the year, in the silver rain
				<br>When petal by petal the blossoms fall
				<br>And the mocking birds call
				<br>And the whippoorwill sings, Marguerite.
				<br>The first cinema show in our town opened in 1906
				<br>At the old Olympic, which was then call'd Park,
				<br>And moving beams shot weirdly thro' the dark
				<br>And spit tobacco seldom hit the mark.
				<br>Have you read Dickens' American Notes?
				<br>My great-great-grandfather was born in a white house
				<br>Under green trees in the country
				<br>And he used to believe in religion and the weather.
				<h3 align="center">II</h3>
				<p>"Shantih, shantih, shantih"..."Shanty House"
				<br>Was the name of a novel by I forget whom
				<br>Published serially in the "All-Story Weekly"
				<br>Before it was a weekly. Advt.
				<br>Disillusion is wonderful, I've been told,
				<br>And I take quinine to stop a cold
				<br>But it makes my ears... always...
				<br>Always ringing in my ears...
				<br>It is the ghost of the Jew I murdered that Christmas day
				<br>Because he played "Three O'Clock in the Morning" in the flat above me...
				<br>Three O'Clock in the morning, I've danc'd the whole night through
				<br>Dancing on the graves in the graveyard
				<br>Where life is buried; life and beauty
				<br>Life and art and love and duty
				<br>Ah, there, sweet cutie.
				<br>Stung!
				<br>Out of the night that covers me
				<br>Black as the pit from pole to pole
				<br>I never quote things straight except by accident.
				<br>Sophistication! Sophistication!
				<br>You are the idol of our nation
				<br>Each fellow has
				<br>Fallen for jazz
				<br>And we'll give the past a merry razz
				<br>Thro' the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber
				<br>And fellow-guestship with the glutless worm.
				<br>Next stop is 57th St. - 57th St. the next stop.
				<br>Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring,
				<br>And the governor-general of Canada is Lord Byng
				<br>Whose ancestor was shot or hung,
				<br>I forget which, the good die young.
				<br>Here's to your ripe old age,
				<br>Copyright, 1847, by Joseph Miner,
				<br>Entered according to act of Congress.
				<h3 align="center">III</h3>
				<p>In the office of the librarian of Congress
				<br>America was discovered in 1492
				<br>This way out.
				<br>No, lady, you gotta change at Washington St. to the Everett train.
				<br>Out in the rain on the elevated
				<br>Crated, sated, all mismated.
				<br>Twelve seats on this bench,
				<br>How quaint.
				<br>In a shady nook, beside a brook, two lovers stroll along.
				<br>Express to Park Ave., Car Following.
				<br>No, we had it cleaned with the sand blast.
				<br>I know it ought to be torn down.
				<br>Before the bar of a saloon there stood a reckless crew,
				<br>When one said to another, "Jack, this message came for you."
				<br>"It may be from a sweetheart, boys," said someone in the crowd,
				<br>And here the words are missing... but Jack cried out aloud:
				<br>"It's only a message from home, sweet home,
				<br>From loved ones down on the farm
				<br>Fond wife and mother, sister and brother..."
				<br>Bootleggers all and you're another
				<br>In the shade of the old apple tree
				<br>'Neath the old cherry tree sweet Marie
				<br>The Conchologist's First Book
				<br>By Edgar Allan Poe
				<br>Stubbed his toe
				<br>On a broken brick that didn't show
				<br>Or a banana peel
				<br>In the fifth reel
				<br>By George Creel
				<br>It is to laugh
				<br>And quaff
				<br>It makes you stout and hale
				<br>And all my days I'll sing the praise
				<br>Of Ivory Soap
				<br>Have you a little T. S. Eliot in your house?
				<h3 align="center">IV</h3>
				<p>The stag at eve had drunk his fill
				<br>The thirsty hart look'd up the hill
				<br>And craned his neck just as a feeler
				<br>To advertise the Double-Dealer.
				<br>William Congreve was a gentleman
				<br>O art what sins are committed in thy name
				<br>For tawdry fame and fleeting flame
				<br>And everything, ain't dat a shame?
				<br>Mah Creole Belle, ah lubs yo' well;
				<br>Aroun' mah heart you hab cast a spell
				<br>But I can't learn to spell pseudocracy
				<br>Because there ain't no such word.
				<br>And I says to Lizzie, if Joe was my feller
				<br>I'd teach him to go to dances with that
				<br>Rat, bat, cat, hat, flat, plat, fat
				<br>Fry the fat, fat the fry
				<br>You'll be a drug-store by and by.
				<br>Get the hook!
				<br>Above the lines of brooding hills
				<br>Rose spires that reeked of nameless ills,
				<br>And ghastly shone upon the sight
				<br>In ev'ry flash of lurid light
				<br>To be continued.
				<br>No smoking.
				<br>Smoking on four rear seats.
				<br>Fare win return to 5 cents after August 1st
				<br>Except outside the Cleveland city limits.
				<br>In the ghoul-haunted Woodland of Weir
				<br>Strangers pause to shed a tear;
				<br>Henry Fielding wrote "Tom Jones"
				<br>And cursed be he that moves my bones.
				<br>I saw the Leonard-Tendler fight
				<br>Farewell, farewell, O go to hell.
				<br>Nobody home
				<br>In the shantih.
