   Life is a hideous thing, and from the background behind what we know of it
   peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold
   more hideous. Science, already oppressive with its shocking revelations,
   will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species - if
   separate species we be - for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never
   be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world. If we knew what we
   are, we should do as Sir Arthur Jermyn did; and Arthur Jermyn soaked
   himself in oil and set fire to his clothing one night. No one placed the
   charred fragments in an urn or set a memorial to him who had been; for
   certain papers and a certain boxed object were found which made men wish
   to forget. Some who knew him do not admit that he ever existed.

   Arthur Jermyn went out on the moor and burned himself after seeing the
   boxed object which had come from Africa. It was this object, and not his
   peculiar personal appearance, which made him end his life. Many would have
   disliked to live if possessed of the peculiar features of Arthur Jermyn,
   but he had been a poet and scholar and had not minded. Learning was in his
   blood, for his great-grandfather, Sir Robert Jermyn, Bt., had been an
   anthropologist of note, whilst his great-great-great-grandfather, Sir Wade
   Jermyn, was one of the earliest explorers of the Congo region, and had
   written eruditely of its tribes, animals, and supposed antiquities.
   Indeed, old Sir Wade had possessed an intellectual zeal amounting almost
   to a mania; his bizarre conjectures on a prehistoric white Congolese
   civilisation earning him much ridicule when his book, Observation on the
   Several Parts of Africa, was published. In 1765 this fearless explorer had
   been placed in a madhouse at Huntingdon.

   Madness was in all the Jermyns, and people were glad there were not many
   of them. The line put forth no branches, and Arthur was the last of it. If
   he had not been, one can not say what he would have done when the object
   came. The Jermyns never seemed to look quite right - something was amiss,
   though Arthur was the worst, and the old family portraits in Jermyn House
   showed fine faces enough before Sir Wade's time. Certainly, the madness
   began with Sir Wade, whose wild stories of Africa were at once the delight
   and terror of his few friends. It showed in his collection of trophies and
   specimens, which were not such as a normal man would accumulate and
   preserve, and appeared strikingly in the Oriental seclusion in which he
   kept his wife. The latter, he had said, was the daughter of a Portuguese
   trader whom he had met in Africa; and did not like English ways. She, with
   an infant son born in Africa, had accompanied him back from the second and
   longest of his trips, and had gone with him on the third and last, never
   returning. No one had ever seen her closely, not even the servants; for
   her disposition had been violent and singular. During her brief stay at
   Jermyn House she occupied a remote wing, and was waited on by her husband
   alone. Sir Wade was, indeed, most peculiar in his solicitude for his
   family; for when he returned to Africa he would permit no one to care for
   his young son save a loathsome black woman from Guinea. Upon coming back,
   after the death of Lady Jermyn, he himself assumed complete care of the
   boy.

   But it was the talk of Sir Wade, especially when in his cups, which
   chiefly led his friends to deem him mad. In a rational age like the
   eighteenth century it was unwise for a man of learning to talk about wild
   sights and strange scenes under a Congo moon; of the gigantic walls and
   pillars of a forgotten city, crumbling and vine-grown, and of damp,
   silent, stone steps leading interminably down into the darkness of abysmal
   treasure-vaults and inconceivable catacombs. Especially was it unwise to
   rave of the living things that might haunt such a place; of creatures half
   of the jungle and half of the impiously aged city-fabulous creatures which
   even a Pliny might describe with scepticism; things that might have sprung
   up after the great apes had overrun the dying city with the walls and the
   pillars, the vaults and the weird carvings. Yet after he came home for the
   last time Sir Wade would speak of such matters with a shudderingly uncanny
   zest, mostly after his third glass at the Knight's Head; boasting of what
   he had found in the jungle and of how he had dwelt among terrible ruins
   known only to him. And finally he had spoken of the living things in such
   a manner that he was taken to the madhouse. He had shown little regret
   when shut into the barred room at Huntingdon, for his mind moved
   curiously. Ever since his son had commenced to grow out of infancy, he had
   liked his home less and less, till at last he had seemed to dread it. The
   Knight's Head had been his headquarters, and when he was confined he
   expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection. Three years later he
   died.

   Wade Jermyn's son Philip was a highly peculiar person. Despite a strong
   physical resemblance to his father, his appearance and conduct were in
   many particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned. Though he did
   not inherit the madness which was feared by some, he was densely stupid
   and given to brief periods of uncontrollable violence. In frame he was
   small, but intensely powerful, and was of incredible agility. Twelve years
   after succeeding to his title he married the daughter of his gamekeeper, a
   person said to be of gypsy extraction, but before his son was born joined
   the navy as a common sailor, completing the general disgust which his
   habits and misalliance had begun. After the close of the American war he
   was heard of as sailor on a merchantman in the African trade, having a
   kind of reputation for feats of strength and climbing, but finally
   disappearing one night as his ship lay off the Congo coast.

   In the son of Sir Philip Jermyn the now accepted family peculiarity took a
   strange and fatal turn. Tall and fairly handsome, with a sort of weird
   Eastern grace despite certain slight oddities of proportion, Robert Jermyn
   began life as a scholar and investigator. It was he who first studied
   scientifically the vast collection of relics which his mad grandfather had
   brought from Africa, and who made the family name as celebrated in
   ethnology as in exploration. In 1815 Sir Robert married a daughter of the
   seventh Viscount Brightholme and was subsequently blessed with three
   children, the eldest and youngest of whom were never publicly seen on
   account of deformities in mind and body. Saddened by these family
   misfortunes, the scientist sought relief in work, and made two long
   expeditions in the interior of Africa. In 1849 his second son, Nevil, a
   singularly repellent person who seemed to combine the surliness of Philip
   Jermyn with the hauteur of the Brightholmes, ran away with a vulgar
   dancer, but was pardoned upon his return in the following year. He came
   back to Jermyn House a widower with an infant son, Alfred, who was one day
   to be the father of Arthur Jermyn.

   Friends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind of
   Sir Robert Jermyn, yet it was probably merely a bit of African folklore
   which caused the disaster. The elderly scholar had been collecting legends
   of the Onga tribes near the field of his grandfather's and his own
   explorations, hoping in some way to account for Sir Wade's wild tales of a
   lost city peopled by strange hybrid creatures. A certain consistency in
   the strange papers of his ancestor suggested that the madman's imagination
   might have been stimulated by native myths. On October 19, 1852, the
   explorer Samuel Seaton called at Jermyn House with a manuscript of notes
   collected among the Ongas, believing that certain legends of a gray city
   of white apes ruled by a white god might prove valuable to the
   ethnologist. In his conversation he probably supplied many additional
   details; the nature of which will never be known, since a hideous series
   of tragedies suddenly burst into being. When Sir Robert Jermyn emerged
   from his library he left behind the strangled corpse of the explorer, and
   before he could be restrained, had put an end to all three of his
   children; the two who were never seen, and the son who had run away. Nevil
   Jermyn died in the successful defence of his own two-year-old son, who had
   apparently been included in the old man's madly murderous scheme. Sir
   Robert himself, after repeated attempts at suicide and a stubborn refusal
   to utter an articulate sound, died of apoplexy in the second year of his
   confinement.

   Sir Alfred Jermyn was a baronet before his fourth birthday, but his tastes
   never matched his title. At twenty he had joined a band of music-hall
   performers, and at thirty-six had deserted his wife and child to travel
   with an itinerant American circus. His end was very revolting. Among the
   animals in the exhibition with which he travelled was a huge bull gorilla
   of lighter colour than the average; a surprisingly tractable beast of much
   popularity with the performers. With this gorilla Alfred Jermyn was
   singularly fascinated, and on many occasions the two would eye each other
   for long periods through the intervening bars. Eventually Jermyn asked and
   obtained permission to train the animal, astonishing audiences and fellow
   performers alike with his success. One morning in Chicago, as the gorilla
   and Alfred Jermyn were rehearsing an exceedingly clever boxing match, the
   former delivered a blow of more than the usual force, hurting both the
   body and the dignity of the amateur trainer. Of what followed, members of
   "The Greatest Show On Earth" do not like to speak. They did not expect to
   hear Sir Alfred Jermyn emit a shrill, inhuman scream, or to see him seize
   his clumsy antagonist with both hands, dash it to the floor of the cage,
   and bite fiendishly at its hairy throat. The gorilla was off its guard,
   but not for long, and before anything could be done by the regular
   trainer, the body which had belonged to a baronet was past recognition.

                                       II

   Arthur Jermyn was the son of Sir Alfred Jermyn and a music-hall singer of
   unknown origin. When the husband and father deserted his family, the
   mother took the child to Jermyn House; where there was none left to object
   to her presence. She was not without notions of what a nobleman's dignity
   should be, and saw to it that her son received the best education which
   limited money could provide. The family resources were now sadly slender,
   and Jermyn House had fallen into woeful disrepair, but young Arthur loved
   the old edifice and all its contents. He was not like any other Jermyn who
   had ever lived, for he was a poet and a dreamer. Some of the neighbouring
   families who had heard tales of old Sir Wade Jermyn's unseen Portuguese
   wife declared that her Latin blood must be showing itself; but most
   persons merely sneered at his sensitiveness to beauty, attributing it to
   his music-hall mother, who was socially unrecognised. The poetic delicacy
   of Arthur Jermyn was the more remarkable because of his uncouth personal
   appearance. Most of the Jermyns had possessed a subtly odd and repellent
   cast, but Arthur's case was very striking. It is hard to say just what he
   resembled, but his expression, his facial angle, and the length of his
   arms gave a thrill of repulsion to those who met him for the first time.

   It was the mind and character of Arthur Jermyn which atoned for his
   aspect. Gifted and learned, he took highest honours at Oxford and seemed
   likely to redeem the intellectual fame of his family. Though of poetic
   rather than scientific temperament, he planned to continue the work of his
   forefathers in African ethnology and antiquities, utilising the truly
   wonderful though strange collection of Sir Wade. With his fanciful mind he
   thought often of the prehistoric civilisation in which the mad explorer
   had so implicitly believed, and would weave tale after tale about the
   silent jungle city mentioned in the latter's wilder notes and paragraphs.
   For the nebulous utterances concerning a nameless, unsuspected race of
   jungle hybrids he had a peculiar feeling of mingled terror and attraction,
   speculating on the possible basis of such a fancy, and seeking to obtain
   light among the more recent data gleaned by his great-grandfather and
   Samuel Seaton amongst the Ongas.

   In 1911, after the death of his mother, Sir Arthur Jermyn determined to
   pursue his investigations to the utmost extent. Selling a portion of his
   estate to obtain the requisite money, he outfitted an expedition and
   sailed for the Congo. Arranging with the Belgian authorities for a party
   of guides, he spent a year in the Onga and Kahn country, finding data
   beyond the highest of his expectations. Among the Kaliris was an aged
   chief called Mwanu, who possessed not only a highly retentive memory, but
   a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old legends. This
   ancient confirmed every tale which Jermyn had heard, adding his own
   account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to him.

   According to Mwanu, the gray city and the hybrid creatures were no more,
   having been annihilated by the warlike N'bangus many years ago. This
   tribe, after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live beings,
   had carried off the stuffed goddess which had been the object of their
   quest; the white ape-goddess which the strange beings worshipped, and
   which was held by Congo tradition to be the form of one who had reigned as
   a princess among these beings. Just what the white apelike creatures could
   have been, Mwanu had no idea, but he thought they were the builders of the
   ruined city. Jermyn could form no conjecture, but by close questioning
   obtained a very picturesque legend of the stuffed goddess.

   The ape-princess, it was said, became the consort of a great white god who
   had come out of the West. For a long time they had reigned over the city
   together, but when they had a son, all three went away. Later the god and
   princess had returned, and upon the death of the princess her divine
   husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone,
   where it was worshipped. Then he departed alone. The legend here seemed to
   present three variants. According to one story, nothing further happened
   save that the stuffed goddess became a symbol of supremacy for whatever
   tribe might possess it. It was for this reason that the N'bangus carried
   it off. A second story told of a god's return and death at the feet of his
   enshrined wife. A third told of the return of the son, grown to manhood -
   or apehood or godhood, as the case might be - yet unconscious of his
   identity. Surely the imaginative blacks had made the most of whatever
   events might lie behind the extravagant legendry.

   Of the reality of the jungle city described by old Sir Wade, Arthur Jermyn
   had no further doubt; and was hardly astonished when early in 1912 he came
   upon what was left of it. Its size must have been exaggerated, yet the
   stones lying about proved that it was no mere Negro village. Unfortunately
   no carvings could be found, and the small size of the expedition prevented
   operations toward clearing the one visible passageway that seemed to lead
   down into the system of vaults which Sir Wade had mentioned. The white
   apes and the stuffed goddess were discussed with all the native chiefs of
   the region, but it remained for a European to improve on the data offered
   by old Mwanu. M. Verhaeren, Belgian agent at a trading-post on the Congo,
   believed that he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess, of
   which he had vaguely heard; since the once mighty N'bangus were now the
   submissive servants of King Albert's government, and with but little
   persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had
   carried off. When Jermyn sailed for England, therefore, it was with the
   exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless
   ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his
   great-great-great-grandfather's narratives - that is, the wildest which he
   had ever heard. Countrymen near Jermyn House had perhaps heard wilder
   tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to Sir Wade around the
   tables of the Knight's Head.

   Arthur Jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from M.
   Verhaeren, meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts
   left by his mad ancestor. He began to feel closely akin to Sir Wade, and
   to seek relics of the latter's personal life in England as well as of his
   African exploits. Oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded wife had
   been numerous, but no tangible relic of her stay at Jermyn House remained.
   Jermyn wondered what circumstance had prompted or permitted such an
   effacement, and decided that the husband's insanity was the prime cause.
   His great-great-great-grandmother, he recalled, was said to have been the
   daughter of a Portuguese trader in Africa. No doubt her practical heritage
   and superficial knowledge of the Dark Continent had caused her to flout
   Sir Wade's tales of the interior, a thing which such a man would not be
   likely to forgive. She had died in Africa, perhaps dragged thither by a
   husband determined to prove what he had told. But as Jermyn indulged in
   these reflections he could not but smile at their futility, a century and
   a half after the death of both his strange progenitors.

   In June, 1913, a letter arrived from M. Verhaeren, telling of the finding
   of the stuffed goddess. It was, the Belgian averred, a most extraordinary
   object; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify. Whether
   it was human or simian only a scientist could determine, and the process
   of determination would be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition.
   Time and the Congo climate are not kind to mummies; especially when their
   preparation is as amateurish as seemed to be the case here. Around the
   creature's neck had been found a golden chain bearing an empty locket on
   which were armorial designs; no doubt some hapless traveller's keepsake,
   taken by the N'bangus and hung upon the goddess as a charm. In commenting
   on the contour of the mummy's face, M. Verhaeren suggested a whimsical
   comparison; or rather, expressed a humorous wonder just how it would
   strike his corespondent, but was too much interested scientifically to
   waste many words in levity. The stuffed goddess, he wrote, would arrive
   duly packed about a month after receipt of the letter.

   The boxed object was delivered at Jermyn House on the afternoon of August
   3, 1913, being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which housed the
   collection of African specimens as arranged by Sir Robert and Arthur. What
   ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants and from things and
   papers later examined. Of the various tales, that of aged Soames, the
   family butler, is most ample and coherent. According to this trustworthy
   man, Sir Arthur Jermyn dismissed everyone from the room before opening the
   box, though the instant sound of hammer and chisel showed that he did not
   delay the operation. Nothing was heard for some time; just how long Soames
   cannot exactly estimate, but it was certainly less than a quarter of an
   hour later that the horrible scream, undoubtedly in Jermyn's voice, was
   heard. Immediately afterward Jermyn emerged from the room, rushing
   frantically toward the front of the house as if pursued by some hideous
   enemy. The expression on his face, a face ghastly enough in repose, was
   beyond description. When near the front door he seemed to think of
   something, and turned back in his flight, finally disappearing down the
   stairs to the cellar. The servants were utterly dumbfounded, and watched
   at the head of the stairs, but their master did not return. A smell of oil
   was all that came up from the regions below. After dark a rattling was
   heard at the door leading from the cellar into the courtyard; and a
   stable-boy saw Arthur Jermyn, glistening from head to foot with oil and
   redolent of that fluid, steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor
   surrounding the house. Then, in an exaltation of supreme horror, everyone
   saw the end. A spark appeared on the moor, a flame arose, and a pillar of
   human fire reached to the heavens. The house of Jermyn no longer existed.

   The reason why Arthur Jermyn's charred fragments were not collected and
   buried lies in what was found afterward, principally the thing in the box.
   The stuffed goddess was a nauseous sight, withered and eaten away, but it
   was clearly a mummified white ape of some unknown species, less hairy than
   any recorded variety, and infinitely nearer mankind - quite shockingly so.
   Detailed description would be rather unpleasant, but two salient
   particulars must be told, for they fit in revoltingly with certain notes
   of Sir Wade Jermyn's African expeditions and with the Congolese legends of
   the white god and the ape-princess. The two particulars in question are
   these: the arms on the golden locket about the creature's neck were the
   Jermyn arms, and the jocose suggestion of M. Verhaeren about certain
   resemblance as connected with the shrivelled face applied with vivid,
   ghastly, and unnatural horror to none other than the sensitive Arthur
   Jermyn, great-great-great-grandson of Sir Wade Jermyn and an unknown wife.
   Members of the Royal Anthropological Institute burned the thing and threw
   the locket into a well, and some of them do not admit that Arthur Jermyn
   ever existed.
