   It is only within the last few years that most people have stopped
   thinking of the West as a new land. I suppose the idea gained ground
   because our own especial civilisation happens to be new there; but
   nowadays explorers are digging beneath the surface and bringing up whole
   chapters of life that rose and fell among these plains and mountains
   before recorded history began. We think nothing of a Pueblo village 2500
   years old, and it hardly jolts us when archaeologists put the sub-pedregal
   culture of Mexico back to 17,000 or 18,000 B.C. We hear rumours of still
   older things, too-of primitive man contemporaneous with extinct animals
   and known today only through a few fragmentary bones and artifacts-so that
   the idea of newness is fading out pretty rapidly. Europeans usually catch
   the sense of immemorial ancientness and deep deposits from successive
   life-streams better than we do. Only a couple of years ago a British
   author spoke of Arizona as a "moon-dim region, very lovely in its way, and
   stark and old-an ancient, lonely land".

   Yet I believe I have a deeper sense of the stupefying-almost
   horrible-ancientness of the West than any European. It all comes from an
   incident that happened in 1928; an incident which I'd greatly like to
   dismiss as three-quarters hallucination, but which has left such a
   frightfully firm impression on my memory that I can't put it off very
   easily. It was in Oklahoma, where my work as an American Indian
   ethnologist constantly takes me and where I had come upon some devilishly
   strange and disconcerting matters before. Make no mistake-Oklahoma is a
   lot more than a mere pioneers' and promoters' frontier. There are old, old
   tribes with old, old memories there; and when the tom-toms beat
   ceaselessly over brooding plains in the autumn the spirits of men are
   brought dangerously close to primal, whispered things. I am white and
   Eastern enough myself, but anybody is welcome to know that the rites of
   Yig, Father of Snakes, can get a real shudder out of me any day. I have
   heard and seen too much to be "sophisticated" in such matters. And so it
   is with this incident of 1928. I'd like to laugh it off-but I can't.

   I had gone into Oklahoma to track down and correlate one of the many ghost
   tales which were current among the white settlers, but which had strong
   Indian corroboration, and-I felt sure-an ultimate Indian source. They were
   very curious, these open-air ghost tales; and though they sounded flat and
   prosaic in the mouths of the white people, they had earmarks of linkage
   with some of the richest and obscurest phases of native mythology. All of
   them were woven around the vast, lonely, artificial-looking mounds in the
   western part of the state, and all of them involved apparitions of
   exceedingly strange aspect and equipment.

   The commonest, and among the oldest, became quite famous in 1892, when a
   government marshal named John Willis went into the mound region after
   horse-thieves and came out with a wild yarn of nocturnal cavalry horses in
   the air between great armies of invisible spectres-battles that involved
   the rush of hooves and feet, the thud of blows, the clank of metal on
   metal, the muffled cries of warriors, and the fall of human and equine
   bodies. These things happened by moonlight, and frightened his horse as
   well as himself. The sounds persisted an hour at a time; vivid, but
   subdued as if brought from a distance by a wind, and unaccompanied by any
   glimpse of the armies themselves. Later on Willis learned that the seat of
   the sounds was a notoriously haunted spot, shunned by settlers and Indians
   alike. Many had seen, or half seen, the warring horsemen in the sky, and
   had furnished dim, ambiguous descriptions. The settlers described the
   ghostly fighters as Indians, though of no familiar tribe, and having the
   most singular costumes and weapons. They even went so far as to say that
   they could not be sure the horses were really horses.

   The Indians, on the other hand, did not seem to claim the spectres as
   kinsfolk. They referred to them as "those people", "the old people", or
   "they who dwell below", and appeared to hold them in too great a
   frightened veneration to talk much about them. No ethnologist had been
   able to pin any, tale-teller down to a specific description of the beings,
   and apparently nobody had ever had a very clear look at them. The Indians
   had one or two old proverbs about these phenomena, saying that "men very
   old, make very big spirit; not so old, not so big; older than all time,
   then spirit he so big he near flesh; those old people and spirits they mix
   up-get all the same".

   Now all of this, of course, is "old stuff" to an ethnologist-of a piece
   with the persistent legends of rich hidden cities and buried races which
   abound among the Pueblo and plains Indians, and which lured Coronado
   centuries ago on his vain search for the fabled Quivira. What took me into
   western Oklahoma was something far more definite and tangible-a local and
   distinctive tale which, though really old, was wholly new to the outside
   world of research, and which involved the first clear descriptions of the
   ghosts which it treated of. There was an added thrill in the fact that it
   came from the remote town of Binger, in Caddo County, a place I had long
   known as the scene of a very terrible and partly inexplicable occurrence
   connected with the snake-god myth.

   The tale, outwardly, was an extremely naive and simple one, and centred in
   a huge, lone mound or small hill that rose above the plain about a third
   of a mile west of the village-a mound which some thought a product of
   Nature, but which others believed to be a burial-place or ceremonial dais
   constructed by prehistoric tribes. This mound, the villagers said, was
   constantly haunted by, two Indian figures which appeared in alternation;
   an old man who paced back and forth along the top from dawn till dusk,
   regardless of the weather and with only brief intervals of disappearance,
   and a squaw who took his place at night with a blue-flamed torch that
   glimmered quite continuously till morning. When the moon was bright the
   squaw's peculiar figure could be seen fairly plainly, and over half the
   villagers agreed that the apparition was headless.

   Local opinion was divided as to the motives and relative ghostliness of
   the two visions. Some held that the man was not a ghost all, but a living
   Indian who had killed and beheaded a squaw for gold and buried her
   somewhere on the mound. According to these theorists he was pacing the
   eminence through sheer remorse, bound by the spirit of his victim which
   took visible shape after dark. But other theorists, more uniform in their
   spectral beliefs, held that both man and woman were ghosts; the man having
   killed the squaw and himself as well at some very distant period. These
   and minor variant versions seemed to have been current ever since the
   settlement of the Wichita country in 1889, and were, I was told, sustained
   to an astonishing degree by still-existing phenomena which anyone might
   observe for himself. Not many ghost tales offer such free and open proof,
   and I was very eager to see what bizarre wonders might be lurking in this
   small, obscure village so far from the beaten path of crowds and from the
   ruthless searchlight of scientific knowledge. So, in the late summer of
   1928 I took a train for Binger and brooded on strange mysteries as the
   cars rattled timidly along their single track through a lonelier and
   lonlier landscape.

   Binger is a modest cluster of frame houses and stores in the midst of a
   flat windy region full of clouds of red dust. There are about 500
   inhabitants besides the Indians on a neighbouring reservation; the
   principal occupation seeming to be agriculture. The soil is decently
   fertile, and the oil boom has not reached this part of the state. My train
   drew in at twilight, and 1 felt rather lost and uneasy-cut off from
   wholesome and every-day things-as it puffed away to the southward without
   me. The station platform was filled with curious loafers, all of whom
   seemed eager to direct me when I asked for the man to whom I had letters
   of introduction. I was ushered along a commonplace main street whose ruled
   surface was red with the sandstone soil of the country, and finally
   delivered at the door of my prospective host. Those who had arranged
   things for me had done well; for Mr. Compton was a man of high
   intelligence and local responsibility, while his mother-who lived with him
   and was familiarly known as "Grandma Compton"-was one of the first pioneer
   generation, and a veritable mine of anecdote and folklore.

   That evening the Comptons summed up for me all the legends current among
   the villagers, proving that the phenomenon I had come to study was indeed
   a baffling and important one. The ghosts, it seems, were accepted almost
   as a matter of course by everyone in Binger. Two generations had been born
   and grown up within sight of that queer, lone tumulus and its restless
   figures. The neighbourhood of the mound was naturally feared and shunned,
   so that the village and the farms had not spread toward it in all four
   decades of settlement; yet venturesome individuals had several times
   visited it. Some had come back to report that they saw no ghosts at all
   when they neared the dreaded hill; that somehow the lone sentinel had
   stepped out of sight before they reached the spot, leaving them free to
   climb the steep slope and explore the flat summit. There was nothing up
   there, they said-merely a rough expanse of underbrush. Where the Indian
   watcher could have vanished to, they had no idea. He must, they reflected,
   have descended the slope and somehow managed to escape unseen along the
   plain; although there was no convenient cover within sight. At any rate,
   there did not appear to be any opening into the mound; a conclusion which
   was reached after considerable exploration of the shrubbery and tall grass
   on all sides. In a few cases some of the more sensitive searchers declared
   that they felt a sort of invisible restraining presence; but they could
   describe nothing more definite than that.

   It was simply as if the air thickened against them in the direction they
   wished to move. It is heedless to mention that all these daring surveys
   were conducted by day. Nothing in the universe could have induced any
   human being, white or red, to approach that sinister elevation after dark;
   and indeed, no Indian would have thought of going near it even in the
   brightest sunlight.

   But it was not from the tales of these sane, observant seekers that the
   chief terror of the ghost-mound sprang; indeed, had their experience been
   typical, the phenomenon would have bulked far less prominently in the
   local legendry. The most evil thing was the fact that many other seekers
   had come back strangely impaired in mind and body, or had not come back at
   all. The first of these cases had occurred in 1891, when a young man named
   Heaton had gone with a shovel to see what hidden secrets he could unearth.
   He had heard curious tales from the Indians, and had laughed at the barren
   report of another youth who had been out to the mound and had found
   nothing. Heaton had watched the mound with a spy glass from the village
   while the other youth made his trip; and as the explorer neared the spot,
   he saw the sentinel Indian walk deliberately down into the tumulus as if a
   trap-door and staircase existed on the top. The other youth had not
   noticed how the Indian disappeared, but had merely found him gone upon
   arriving at the mound.

   When Heaton made his own trip he resolved to get to the bottom of the
   mystery, and watchers from the village saw him hacking diligently at the
   shrubbery atop the mound. Then they saw his figure melt slowly into
   invisibility; not to reappear for long hours, till after the dusk drew on,
   and the torch of the headless squaw glimmered ghoulishly on the distant
   elevation. About two hours after nightfall he staggered into the village
   minus his spade and other belongings, and burst into a shrieking monologue
   of disconnected ravings. He howled of shocking abysses and monsters, of
   terrible carvings and statues, of inhuman captors and grotesque tortures,
   and of other fantastic abnormalities too complex and chimerical even to
   remember. "Old! Old! Old!" he would moan over and over again, "great God,
   they are older than the earth, and came here from somewhere else-they know
   what you think, and make you know what they think-they're half-man,
   half-ghost-crossed the line-melt and take shape again-getting more and
   more so, yet we're all descended from them in the beginning-children of
   Tulu-everything made of gold-monstrous animals, half-human-dead
   slaves-madness-Ia:! Shub-Niggurath!-that white man-oh, my God, What they
   did to him!..."

   Heaton was the village idiot for about eight years, after which he died in
   an epileptic fit. Since his ordeal there had been two more cases of
   mound-madness, and eight of total disappearance. Immediately after
   Heaton's mad return, three desperate and determined men had gone out to
   the lone hill together; heavily armed, and with spades and pickaxes.
   Watching villagers saw the Indian ghost melt away as the explorers drew
   near, and afterward saw the men climb the mound and begin scouting around
   through the underbrush. All at once they faded into nothingness, and were
   never seen again. One watcher, with an especially powerful telescope,
   thought he saw other forms dimly materialise beside the hapless men and
   drag them down into the mound; but this account remained uncorroborated.
   It is needless to say that no searching-party went out after the lost
   ones, and that for many years the mound was wholly unvisited. Only when
   the incidents of 1891 were largely forgotten did anybody dare to think of
   further explorations. Then, about 1910, a fellow too young to recall the
   old horrors made a trip to the shunned spot and found nothing at all.

   By 1915 the acute dread and wild legendry of '91 had largely faded into
   the commonplace and unimaginative ghost-tales at present surviving-that
   is, had so faded among the white people. On the nearby reservation were
   old Indians who thought much and kept their own counsel. About this time a
   second wave of active curiosity and adventuring developed, and several
   bold searchers made the trip to the mound and returned. Then came a trip
   of two Eastern visitors with spades and other apparatus-a pair of amateur
   archaeologists connected with a small college, who had been making studies
   among the Indians. No one watched this trip from the village, but they
   never came back. The searching-party that went out after them-among whom
   was my host Clyde Compton-found nothing whatsoever amiss at the mound.

   The next trip was the solitary venture of old Capt. Lawton, a grizzled
   pioneer who had helped to open up the region in 1889, but who had never
   been there since. He had recalled the mound and its fascination all
   through the years; and being now in comfortable retirement, resolved to
   have a try at solving the ancient riddle. Long familiarity with Indian
   myth had given him ideas rather stranger than those of the simple
   villagers, and he had made preparations for some extensive delving. He
   ascended the mound on the morning of Thursday, May 11, 1916, watched
   through spy glasses by more than twenty people in the village and on the
   adjacent plain. His disappearance was very sudden, and occurred as he was
   hacking at the shrubbery with a brush-cutter. No one could say more than
   that he was there one moment and absent the next. For over a week no
   tidings of him reached Binger, and then-in the middle of the night-there
   dragged itself into the village the object about which dispute still
   rages.

   It said it was-or had been-Capt. Lawton, but it was definitely younger by
   as much as forty years than the old man who had climbed the mound. Its
   hair was jet black, and its face-now distorted with nameless fright-free
   from wrinkles. But it did remind Grandma Compton most uncannily of the
   captain as he had looked back in '89. Its feet were cut off neatly at the
   ankles, and the stumps were smoothly healed to an extent almost incredible
   if the being really were the man who had walked upright a week before. It
   babbled of incomprehensible things, and kept repeating the name "George
   Lawton, George E. Lawton" as if trying to reassure itself of its own
   identity. The things it babbled of, Grandma Compton thought, were
   curiously like the hallucinations of poor young Heaton in '91; though
   there were minor differences. "The blue light!-the blue light!..."
   muttered the object, "always down there, before there were any living
   things-older than the dinosaurs-always the same, only weaker-never
   death-brooding and brooding and brooding-the same people, half-man and
   half-gas-the dead that walk and work-oh, those beasts, those half-human
   unicorns-houses and cities of gold-old, old, old, older than time-came
   down from the stars-Great Tulu-Azathoth-Nyarlathotep-waiting, waiting...."
   The object died before dawn.

   Of course there was an investigation, and the Indians at the reservation
   were grilled unmercifully. But they knew nothing, and had nothing to say.
   At least, none of them had anything to say except old Grey Eagle, a
   Wichita chieftain whose more than a century of age put him above common
   fears. He alone deigned to grunt some advice.

   "You let um 'lone, white man. No good-those people. All under here, all
   under there, them old ones. Yig, big father of snakes, he there. Yig is
   Yig. Tirawa, big father of men, he there. Tirawa is Tirawa. No die. No get
   old. Just same like air. Just live and wait. One time they come out here,
   live and fight. Build um dirt tepee. Bring up gold-they got plenty. Go off
   and make new lodges. Me them. You them. Then big waters come. All change.
   Nobody come out, let nobody in. Get in, no get out. You let um 'lone, you
   have no bad medicine. Red man know, he no get catch. White man meddle, he
   no come back. Keep 'way little hills. No good. Grey Eagle say this."

   If Joe Norton and Rance Wheelock had taken the old chief's advice, they
   would probably be here today; but they didn't. They were great readers and
   materialists, and feared nothing in heaven or earth; and they thought that
   some Indian fiends had a secret headquarters inside the mound. They had
   been to the mound before, and now they went again to avenge old Capt.
   Lawton-boasting that they'd do it if they had to tear the mound down
   altogether. Clyde Compton watched them with a pair of prism binoculars and
   saw them round the base of the sinister hill. Evidently they meant to
   survey their territory very gradually and minutely. Minutes passed, and
   they did not reappear. Nor were they ever seen again.

   Once more the mound was a thing of panic fright, and only the excitement
   of the Great War served to restore it to the farther background of Binger
   folklore. It was unvisited from 1916 to 1919, and would have remained so
   but for the daredeviltry of some of the youths back from service in
   France. From 1919 to 1920, however, there was a veritable epidemic of
   mound-visiting among the prematurely hardened young veterans-an epidemic
   that waxed as one youth after another returned unhurt and contemptuous. By
   1920-so short is human memory-the mound was almost a joke; and the tame
   story of the murdered squaw began to displace darker whispers on
   everybody's tongues. Then two reckless young brothers-the especially
   unimaginative and hard-boiled Clay boys-decided to go and dig up the
   buried squaw and the gold for which the old Indian had murdered her.

   They went out on a September afternoon-about the time the Indian tom-toms
   begin their incessant annual beating over the flat, red-dusty plains.
   Nobody watched them, and their parents did not become worried at their
   non-return for several hours. Then came an alarm and a searching-party,
   and another resignation to the mystery of silence and doubt.

   But one of them came back after all. It was Ed, the elder, and his
   straw-coloured hair and beard had turned an albino white for two inches
   from the roots. On his forehead was a queer scar like a branded
   hieroglyph. Three months after he and his brother Walker had vanished he
   skulked into his house at night, wearing nothing but a queerly patterned
   blanket which he thrust into the fire as soon as he had got into a suit of
   his own clothes. He told his parents that he and Walker had been captured
   by some strange Indians-not Wichitas or Caddos-and held prisoners
   somewhere toward the west. Walker had died under torture, but he himself
   had managed to escape at a high cost. The experience had been particularly
   terrible, and he could not talk about it just then. He must rest-and
   anyway, it would do no good to give an alarm and try to find and punish
   the Indians. They were not of a sort that could be caught or punished, and
   it was especially important for the good of Binger-for the good of the
   world-that they be not pursued into their secret lair. As a matter of
   fact, they were not altogether what one could call real Indians-he would
   explain about that later. Meanwhile he must rest. Better not to rouse the
   village with the news of his return-he would go upstairs and sleep. Before
   he climbed the rickety flight to his room he took a pad and pencil from
   the living-room table, and an automatic pistol from his father's desk
   drawer.

   Three hours later the shot rang out. Ed Clay had put a bullet neatly
   through his temples with a pistol clutched in his left hand, leaving a
   sparsely written sheet of paper on the rickety table near his bed. He had,
   it later appeared from the whittled pencil-stub and stove full of charred
   paper, originally written much more; but had finally decided not to tell
   what he knew beyond vague hints. The surviving fragment was only a mad
   warning scrawled in a curiously backhanded script-the ravings of a mind
   obviously deranged by hardships-and it read thus; rather surprisingly for
   the utterance of one who had always been stolid and matter-of-fact:

     For gods sake never go nere that mound it is part of some kind of a
     world so devilish and old it cannot be spoke about me and Walker went
     and was took into the thing just melted at times and made up agen and
     the whole world outside is helpless alongside of what they can do-they
     what live forever young as they like and you cant tell if they are
     really men or just gostes-and what they do cant be spoke about and this
     is only 1 entrance-you cant tell how big the whole thing is-after what
     we seen I dont want to live aney more France was nothing besides
     this-and see that people always keep away o god they wood if they see
     poor walker like he was in the end.

     Yrs truely

                                                                      Ed Clay

   At the autopsy it was found that all of young Clay's organs were
   transposed from right to left within his body, as if he had been turned
   inside out. Whether they had always been so, no one could say at the time,
   but it was later learned from army records that Ed had been perfectly
   normal when mustered out of the service in May, 1919. Whether there was a
   mistake somewhere, or whether some unprecedented metamorphosis had indeed
   occurred, is still an unsettled question, as is also the origin of the
   hieroglyph-like scar on the forehead.

   That was the end of the explorations of the mound. In the eight
   intervening years no one had been near the place, and few indeed had even
   cared to level a spy glass at it. From time to time people continued to
   glance nervously at the lone hill as it rose starkly from the plain
   against the western sky, and to shudder at the small dark speck that
   paraded by day and the glimmering will-o'-the-wisp that danced by night.
   The thing was accepted at face value as a mystery not to be probed, and by
   common consent the village shunned the subject. It was, after all, quite
   easy to avoid the hill; for space was unlimited in every direction, and
   community life always follows beaten trails. The mound side of the village
   was simply kept trailless, as if it had been water or swampland or desert.
   And it is a curious commentary on the stolidity and imaginative sterility
   of the human animal that the whispers with which children and strangers
   were warned away from the mound quickly sank once more into the flat tale
   of a murderous Indian ghost and his squaw victim. Only the tribesmen on
   the reservation, and thoughtful old-timers like Grandma Compton,
   remembered the overtones of unholy vistas and deep cosmic menace which
   clustered around the ravings of those who had come back changed and
   shattered.

   It was very late, and Grandma Compton had long since gone upstairs to bed,
   when Clyde finished telling me this. I hardly knew what to think of the
   frightful puzzle, yet rebelled at any notion to conflict with sane
   materialism. What influence had brought madness, or the impulse of flight
   and wandering, to so many who had visited the mound? Though vastly
   impressed, I was spurred on rather than deterred. Surely I must get to the
   bottom of this matter, as well I might if I kept a cool head and an
   unbroken determination. Compton saw my mood and shook his head worriedly.
   Then he motioned me to follow him outdoors.

   We stepped from the frame house to the quiet side street or lane, and
   walked a few paces in the light of a waning August moon to where the
   houses were thinner. The half-moon was still low, and had not blotted many
   stars from the sky; so that I could see not only the weltering gleams of
   Altair and Vega, but the mystic shimmering of the Milky Way, as I looked
   out over the vast expanse of earth and sky in the direction that Compton
   pointed. Then all at once I saw a spark that was not a star-a bluish spark
   that moved and glimmered against the Milky Way near the horizon, and that
   seemed in a vague way more evil and malevolent than anything in the vault
   above. In another moment it was clear that this spark came from the top of
   a long distant rise in the outspread and faintly litten plain; and I
   turned to Compton with a question.

   "Yes," he answered, "it's the blue ghost-light-and that is the mound.
   There's not a night in history that we haven't seen it-and not a living
   soul in Binger that would walk out over that plain toward it. It's a bad
   business, young man, and if you're wise you'll let it rest where it is.
   Better call your search off, son, and tackle some of the other Injun
   legends around here. We've plenty to keep you busy, heaven knows!"

                                      II.

   But I was in no mood for advice; and though Compton gave me a pleasant
   room, I could not sleep a wink through eagerness for the next morning with
   its chances to see the daytime ghost and to question the Indians at the
   reservation. I meant to go about the whole thing slowly and thoroughly,
   equipping myself with all available data both white and red before I
   commenced any actual archaeological investigations. I rose and dressed at
   dawn, and when I heard others stirring I went downstairs. Compton was
   building the kitchen fire while his mother was busy in the pantry. When he
   saw me he nodded, and after a moment invited me out into the glamorous
   young sunlight. I knew where we were going, and as we walked along the
   lane I strained my eyes westward over the plains.

   There was the mound-far away and very curious in its aspect of artificial
   regularity. It must have been from thirty to forty feet high, and all of a
   hundred yards from north to south as I looked at it. It was not as wide as
   that from east to west, Compton said, but had the contour of a rather
   thinnish ellipse. He, I knew, had been safely out to it and back several
   times. As I looked at the rim silhouetted against the deep blue of the
   west I tried to follow its minor irregularities, and became impressed with
   a sense of something moving upon it. My pulse mounted a bit feverishly,
   and I seized quickly on the high-powered binoculars which Compton had
   quietly offered me. Focussing them hastily, I saw at first only a tangle
   of underbrush on the distant mound's rim-and then something stalked into
   the field.

   It was unmistakably a human shape, and I knew at once that I was seeing
   the daytime "Indian ghost". I did not wonder at the description, for
   surely the tall, lean, darkly robed being with the filleted black hair and
   seamed, coppery, expressionless, aquiline face looked more like an Indian
   than anything else in my previous experience. And yet my trained
   ethnologist's eye told me at once that this was no redskin of any sort
   hitherto known to history, but a creature of vast racial variation and of
   a wholly different culture-stream. Modern Indians are
   brachycephalic-round-headed-and you can't find any dolichocephalic or
   long-headed skulls except in ancient Pueblo deposits dating back 2500
   years or more; yet this man's long-headedness was so pronounced that I
   recognised it at once, even at his vast distance and in the uncertain
   field of the binoculars. I saw, too, that the pattern of his robe
   represented a decorative tradition utterly remote from anything we
   recognise in southwestern native art. There were shining metal trappings,
   likewise, and a short sword or kindred weapon at his side, all wrought in
   a fashion wholly alien to anything I had ever heard of.

   As he paced back and forth along the top of the mound I followed him for
   several minutes with the glass, noting the kinaesthetic quality of his
   stride and the poised way he carried his head; and there was borne in upon
   me the strong, persistent conviction that this man, whoever or whatever he
   might be, was certainly not a savage. He was the product of a
   civilisation, I felt instinctively, though of what civilisation I could
   not guess. At length he disappeared beyond the farther edge of the mound,
   as if descending the opposite and unseen slope; and I lowered the glass
   with a curious mixture of puzzled feelings. Compton was looking
   quizzically at me, and I nodded non-committally. "What do you make of
   that?" he ventured. "This is what we've seen here in Binger every day of
   our lives."

   That noon found me at the Indian reservation talking with old Grey
   Eagle-who, through some miracle, was still alive; though he must have been
   close to a hundred and fifty years old. He was a strange, impressive
   figure-this stern, fearless leader of his kind who had talked with outlaws
   and traders in fringed buckskin and French officials in knee-breeches and
   three-cornered hats-and I was glad to see that, because of my air of
   deference toward him, he appeared to like me. His liking, however, took an
   unfortunately obstructive form as soon as he learned what I wanted; for
   all he would do was to warn me against the search I was about to make.

   "You good boy-you no bother that hill. Bad medicine. Plenty devil under
   there-catchum when you dig. No dig, no hurt. Go and dig, no come back.
   Just same when me boy, just same when my father and he father boy. All
   time buck he walk in day, squaw with no head she walk in night. All time
   since white man with tin coats they come from sunset and below big
   river-long way back-three, four times more back than Grey Eagle-two times
   more back than Frenchmen-all same after then. More back than that, nobody
   go near little hills nor deep valleys with stone caves. Still more back,
   those old ones no hide, come out and make villages. Bring plenty gold. Me
   them. You them. Then big waters come. All change. Nobody come out, let
   nobody in. Get in, no get out. They no die-no get old like Grey Eagle with
   valleys in face and snow on head. Just same like air-some man, some
   spirit. Bad medicine. Sometimes at night spirit come out on
   half-man-half-horse-with-horn and fight where men once fight. Keep 'way
   them place. No good. You good boy-go 'way and let them old ones 'lone."

   That was all I could get out of the ancient chief, and the rest of the
   Indians would say nothing at all. But if I was troubled, Grey Eagle was
   clearly more so; for he obviously felt a real regret at the thought of my
   invading the region he feared so abjectly. As I turned to leave the
   reservation he stopped me for a final ceremonial farewell, and once more
   tried to get my promise to abandon my search. When he saw that he could
   not, he produced something half-timidly from a buckskin pouch he wore, and
   extended it toward me very solemnly. It was a worn but finely minted metal
   disc about two inches in diameter, oddly figured and perforated, and
   suspended from a leathern cord.

   "You no promise, then Grey Eagle no can tell what get you. But if anything
   help um, this good medicine. Come from my father-he get from he father-he
   get from he father-all way back, close to Tirawa, all men's father. My
   father say, 'You keep 'way from those old ones, keep 'way from little
   hills and valleys with stone caves. But if old ones they come out to get
   you, then you shew um this medicine. They know. They make him long way
   back. They look, then they no do such bad medicine maybe. But no can tell.
   You keep 'way, just same. Them no good. No tell what they do.'"

   As he spoke, Grey Eagle was hanging the thing around my neck, and I saw it
   was a very curious object indeed. The more I looked at it, the more I
   marvelled; for not only was its heavy, darkish, lustrous, and richly
   mottled substance an absolutely strange metal to me, but what was left of
   its design seemed to be of a marvellously artistic and utterly unknown
   workmanship. One side, so far as I could see, had borne an exquisitely
   modelled serpent design; whilst the other side had depicted a kind of
   octopus or other tentacled monster. There were some half-effaced
   hieroglyphs, too, of a kind which no archaeologist could identify or even
   place conjecturally. With Grey Eagle's permission I later had expert
   historians, anthropologists, geologists, and chemists pass carefully upon
   the disc, but from them I obtained only a chorus of bafflement. It defied
   either classification or analysis. The chemists called it an amalgam of
   unknown metallic elements of heavy atomic weight, and one geologist
   suggested that the substance must be of meteoric origin, shot from unknown
   gulfs of interstellar space. Whether it really saved my life or sanity or
   existence as a human being I cannot attempt to say, but Grey Eagle is sure
   of it. He has it again, now, and I wonder if it has any connexion with his
   inordinate age. All his fathers who had it lived far beyond the century
   mark, perishing only in battle. Is it possible that Grey Eagle, if kept
   from accidents, will never die? But I am ahead of my story.

   When I returned to the village I tried to secure more mound-lore, but
   found only excited gossip and opposition. It was really flattering to see
   how solicitous the people were about my safety, but I had to set their
   almost frantic remonstrances aside. I shewed them Grey Eagle's charm, but
   none of them had ever heard of it before, or seen anything even remotely
   like it. They agreed that it could not be an Indian relic, and imagined
   that the old chief's ancestors must have obtained it from some trader.

   When they saw they could not deter me from my trip, the Binger citizens
   sadly did what they could to aid my outfitting. Having known before my
   arrival the sort of work to be done, I had most of my supplies already
   with me-machete and trench-knife for shrub-clearing and excavating,
   electric torches for any underground phase which might develop, rope,
   field-glasses, tape-measure, microscope, and incidentals for
   emergencies-as much, in fact, as might be comfortably stowed in a
   convenient handbag. To this equipment I added only the heavy revolver
   which the sheriff forced upon me, and the pick and shovel which I thought
   might expedite my work.

   I decided to carry these latter things slung over my shoulder with a stout
   cord-for I soon saw that I could not hope for any helpers or
   fellow-explorers. The village would watch me, no doubt, with all its
   available telescopes and field-glasses; but it would not send any citizen
   so much as a yard over the flat plain toward the lone hillock. My start
   was timed for early the next morning, and all the rest of that day I was
   treated with the awed and uneasy respect which people give to a man about
   to set out for certain doom.

   When morning came-a cloudy though not a threatening morning-the whole
   village turned out to see me start across the dustblown plain. Binoculars
   shewed the lone man at his usual pacing on the mound, and I resolved to
   keep him in sight as steadily as possible during my approach. At the last
   moment a vague sense of dread oppressed me, and I was just weak and
   whimsical enough to let Grey Eagle's talisman swing on my chest in full
   view of any beings or ghosts who might be inclined to heed it. Bidding au
   revoir to Compton and his mother, I started off at a brisk stride despite
   the bag in my left hand and the clanking pick and shovel strapped to my
   back; holding my field-glass in my right hand and taking a glance at the
   silent pacer from time to time. As I neared the mound I saw the man very
   clearly, and fancied I could trace an expression of infinite evil and
   decadence on his seamed, hairless features. I was startled, too, to see
   that his goldenly gleaming weapon-case bore hieroglyphs very similar to
   those on the unknown talisman I wore. All the creature's costume and
   trappings bespoke exquisite workmanship and cultivation. Then, all too
   abruptly, I saw him startdown the farther side of the mound and out of
   sight. When I reached the place, about ten minutes after I set out, there
   was no one there.

   There is no need of relating how I spent the early part of my search in
   surveying and circumnavigating the mound, taking measurements, and
   stepping back to view the thing from different angles. It had impressed me
   tremendously as I approached it, and there seemed to be a kind of latent
   menace in its too regular outlines. It was the only elevation of any sort
   on the wide, level plain; and I could not doubt for a moment that it was
   an artificial tumulus. The steep sides seemed wholly unbroken, and without
   marks of human tenancy or passage. There were no signs of a path toward
   the top; and, burdened as I was, I managed to scramble up only with
   considerable difficulty. When I reached the summit I found a roughly level
   elliptical plateau about 300 by 50 feet in dimensions; uniformly covered
   with rank grass and dense underbrush, and utterly incompatible with the
   constant presence of a pacing sentinel. This condition gave me a real
   shock, for it shewed beyond question that the "Old Indian", vivid though
   he seemed, could not be other than a collective hallucination.

   I looked about with considerable perplexity and alarm, glancing wistfully
   back at the village and the mass of black dots which I knew was the
   watching crowd. Training my glass upon them, I saw that they were studying
   me avidly with their glasses; so to reassure them I waved my cap in the
   air with a show of jauntiness which I was far from feeling. Then, settling
   to my work I flung down pick, shovel, and bag; taking my machete from the
   latter and commencing to clear away underbrush. It was a weary task, and
   now and then I felt a curious shiver as some perverse gust of wind arose
   to hamper my motion with a skill approaching deliberateness. At times it
   seemed as if a half-tangible force were pushing me back as I worked-almost
   as if the air thickened in front of me, or as if formless hands tugged at
   my wrists. My energy seemed used up without producing adequate results,
   yet for all that I made some progress.

   By afternoon I had clearly perceived that, toward the northern end of the
   mound, there was a slight bowl-like depression in the root-tangled earth.
   While this might mean nothing, it would be a good place to begin when I
   reached the digging stage, and I made a mental note of it. At the same
   time I noticed another and very peculiar thing-namely, that the Indian
   talisman swinging from my neck seemed to behave oddly at a point about
   seventeen feet southeast of the suggested bowl. Its gyrations were altered
   whenever I happened to stoop around that point, and it tugged downward as
   if attracted by some magnetism in the soil. The more I noticed this, the
   more it struck me, till at length I decided to do a little preliminary
   digging there without further delay.

   As I turned up the soil with my trench-knife I could not help wondering at
   the relative thinness of the reddish regional layer. The country as a
   whole was all red sandstone earth, but here I found a strange black loam
   less than a foot down. It was such soil as one finds in the strange, deep
   valleys farther west and south, and must surely have been brought from a
   considerable distance in the prehistoric age when the mound was reared.
   Kneeling and digging, I felt the leathern cord around my neck tugged
   harder and harder, as something in the soil seemed to draw the heavy metal
   talisman more and more. Then I felt my implements strike a hard surface,
   and wondered if a rock layer rested beneath. Prying about with the
   trench-knife, I found that such was not the case. Instead, to my intense
   surprise and feverish interest, I brought up a mould-clogged, heavy object
   of cylindrical shape-about a foot long and four inches in diameter-to
   which my hanging talisman clove with glue-like tenacity. As I cleared off
   the black loam my wonder and tension increased at the bas-reliefs revealed
   by that process. The whole cylinder, ends and all, was covered with
   figures and hieroglyphs; and I saw with growing excitement that these
   things were in the same unknown tradition as those on Grey Eagle's charm
   and on the yellow metal trappings of the ghost I had seen through my
   binoculars.

   Sitting down, I further cleaned the magnetic cylinder against the rough
   corduroy of my knickerbockers, and observed that it was made of the same
   heavy, lustrous unknown metal as the charm-hence, no doubt, the singular
   attraction. The carvings and chasings were very strange and very
   horrible-nameless monsters and designs fraught with insidious evil-and all
   were of the highest finish and craftsmanship. I could not at first make
   head or tail of the thing, and handled it aimlessly until I spied a
   cleavage near one end. Then I sought eagerly for some mode of opening,
   discovering at last that the end simply unscrewed.

   The cap yielded with difficulty, but at last it came off, liberating a
   curious aromatic odour. The sole contents was a bulky roll of a yellowish,
   paper-like substance inscribed in greenish characters, and for a second I
   had the supreme thrill of fancying that I held a written key to unknown
   elder worlds and abysses beyond time. Almost immediately, however, the
   unrolling of one end shewed that the manuscript was in Spanish-albeit the
   formal, pompous Spanish of a long-departed day. In the golden sunset light
   I looked at the heading and the opening paragraph, trying to decipher the
   wretched and ill-punctuated script of the vanished writer. What manner of
   relic was this? Upon what sort of a discovery had I stumbled? The first
   words set me in a new fury of excitement and curiosity, for instead of
   diverting me from my original quest they startlingly confirmed me in that
   very effort.

   The yellow scroll with the green script began with a bold, identifying
   caption and a ceremoniously desperate appeal for belief in incredible
   revelations to follow:

     RELACION DE PANFILO DE ZAMACONA Y NUNEZ, HIDALGO DE LUARCA EN ASTURIAS,
     TOCANTE AL MUNDO SOTERRANEO DE XINAIAN, A. D. MDXLV

     En el nombre de la santisima Trinidad, Padre, Hijo, y Espiritu-Santo,
     tres personas distintas y un solo. Dios verdadero, y de la santisima
     Virgen muestra Senora, YO, PANFILO DE ZAMACONA, HIJO DE PEDRO GUZMAN Y
     ZAMACONA, HIDALGO, Y DE LA DONA YNES ALVARADO Y NUNEZ, DE LUARCA EN
     ASTURIAS, juro para que todo que deco esta verdadero como sacramento....

   I paused to reflect on the portentous significance of what I was reading.
   "The Narrative of Panfilo de Zamacona y Nunez, gentleman, of Luarca in
   Asturias, Concerning the Subterranean World of Xinaian, A. D. 1545" ...
   Here, surely, was too much for any mind to absorb all at once. A
   subterranean world-again that persistent idea which filtered through all
   the Indian tales and through all the utterances of those who had come back
   from the mound. And the date-1545#8212;what could this mean? In 1540
   Coronado and his men had gone north from Mexico into the wilderness, but
   had they not turned back in 1542? My eye ran questingly down the opened
   part of the scroll, and almost at once seized on the name Francisco
   Vasquez de Coronado. The writer of this thing, clearly, was one of
   Coronado's men-but what had he been doing in this remote realm three years
   after his party had gone back? I must read further, for another glance
   told me that what was now unrolled was merely a summary of Coronado's
   northward march, differing in no essential way from the account known to
   history.

   It was only the waning light which checked me before I could unroll and
   read more, and in my impatient bafflement I almost forgot to be frightened
   at the onrush of night in this sinister place. Others, however, had not
   forgotten the lurking terror, for I heard a loud distant hallooing from a
   knot of men who had gathered at the edge of the town. Answering the
   anxious hail, I restored the manuscript to its strange cylinder-to which
   the disc around my neck still clung until I pried it off and packed it and
   my smaller implements for departure. Leaving the pick and shovel for the
   next day's work, I took up my handbag, scrambled down the steep side of
   the mound, and in another quarter-hour was back in the village explaining
   and exhibiting my curious find. As darkness drew on, I glanced back at the
   mound I had so lately left, and saw with a shudder that the faint bluish
   torch of the nocturnal squaw-ghost had begun to glimmer.

   It was hard work waiting to get at the bygone Spaniard's narrative; but I
   knew I must have quiet and leisure for a good translation, so reluctantly
   saved the task for the later hours of night. Promising the townsfolk a
   clear account of my findings in the morning, and giving them an ample
   opportunity to examine the bizarre and provocative cylinder, I accompanied
   Clyde Compton home and ascended to my room for the translating process as
   soon as I possibly could. My host and his mother were intensely eager to
   hear the tale, but I thought they had better wait till I could thoroughly
   absorb the text myself and give them the gist concisely and unerringly.

   Opening my handbag in the light of a single electric bulb, I again took
   out the cylinder and noted the instant magnetism which pulled the Indian
   talisman to its carven surface. The designs glimmered evilly on the richly
   lustrous and unknown metal, and I could not help shivering as I studied
   the abnormal and blasphemous forms that leered at me with such exquisite
   workmanship. I wish now that I had carefully photographed all these
   designs-though perhaps it is just as well that I did not. Of one thing I
   am really glad, and that is that I could not then identify the squatting
   octopus-headed thing which dominated most of the ornate cartouches, and
   which the manuscript called "Tulu". Recently I have associated it, and the
   legends in the manuscript connected with it, with some new-found folklore
   of monstrous and unmentioned Cthulhu, a horror which seeped down from the
   stars while the young earth was still half-formed; and had I known of the
   connexion then, I could not have stayed in the same room with the thing.
   The secondary motif, a semi-anthropomorphic serpent, I did quite readily
   place as a prototype of the Yig, Quetzalcoatl, and Kukulcan conceptions.
   Before opening the cylinder I tested its magnetic powers on metals other
   than that of Grey Eagle's disc, but found that no attraction existed. It
   was no common magnetism which pervaded this morbid fragment of unknown
   worlds and linked it to its kind.

   At last I took out the manuscript and began translating-jotting down a
   synoptic outline in English as I went, and now and then regretting the
   absence of a Spanish dictionary when I came upon some especially obscure
   or archaic word or construction. There was a sense of ineffable
   strangeness in thus being thrown back nearly four centuries in the midst
   of my continuous quest-thrown back to a year when my own forbears were
   settled, homekeeping gentlemen of Somerset and Devon under Henry the
   Eighth, with never a thought of the adventure that was to take their blood
   to Virginia and the New World; yet when that new world possessed, even as
   now, the same brooding mystery of the mound which formed my present sphere
   and horizon. The sense of a throwback was all the stronger because I felt
   instinctively that the common problem of the Spaniard and myself was one
   of such abysmal timelessness-of such unholy and unearthly eternity-that
   the scant four hundred years between us bulked as nothing in comparison.
   It took no more than a single look at that monstrous and insidious
   cylinder to make me realise the dizzying gulfs that yawned between all men
   of the known earth and the primal mysteries it represented. Before that
   gulf Panfilo de Zamacona and I stood side by side; just as Aristotle and
   I, or Cheops and I, might have stood.

                                      III.

   Of his youth in Luarca, a small, placid port on the Bay of Biscay,
   Zamacona told little. He had been wild, and a younger son, and had come to
   New Spain in 1532, when only twenty years old. Sensitively imaginative, he
   had listened spellbound to the floating rumours of rich cities and unknown
   worlds to the north-and especially to the tale of the Franciscan friar
   Marcos de Niza, who came back from a trip in 1539 with glowing accounts of
   fabulous Cibola and its great walled towns with terraced stone houses.
   Hearing of Coronado's contemplated expedition in search of these
   wonders-and of the greater wonders whispered to lie beyond them in the
   land of buffaloes-young Zamacona managed to join the picked party of 300,
   and started north with the rest in 1540.

   History knows the story of that expedition-how Cibola was found to be
   merely the squalid Pueblo village of Zuni, and how de Niza was sent back
   to Mexico in disgrace for his florid exaggerations; how Coronado first saw
   the Grand Canyon, and how at Cicuye, on the Pecos, he heard from the
   Indian called El Turco of the rich and mysterious land of Quivira, far to
   the northeast, where gold, silver, and buffaloes abounded, and where there
   flowed a river two leagues wide. Zamacona told briefly of the winter camp
   at Tiguex on the Pecos, and of the northward start in April, when the
   native guide proved false and led the party astray amidst a land of
   prairie-dogs, salt pools, and roving, bison-hunting tribes.

   When Coronado dismissed his larger force and made his final forty-two-day
   march with a very small and select detachment, Zamacona managed to be
   included in the advancing party. He spoke of the fertile country and of
   the great ravines with trees visible only from the edge of their steep
   banks; and of how all the men lived solely on buffalo-meat. And then came
   mention of the expedition's farthest limit-of the presumable but
   disappointing land of Quivira with its villages of grass houses, its
   brooks and rivers, its good black soil, its plums, nuts, grapes, and
   mulberries, and its maize-growing and copper-using Indians. The execution
   of El Turco, the false native guide, was casually touched upon, and there
   was a mention of the cross which Coronado raised on the bank of a great
   river in the autumn of 1541-a cross bearing the inscription, "Thus far
   came the great general, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado".

   This supposed Quivira lay at about the fortieth parallel of north
   latitude, and I see that quite lately the New York archaeologist Dr. Hodge
   has identified it with the course of the Arkansas River through Barton and
   Rice Counties, Kansas. It is the old home of the Wichitas, before the
   Sioux drove them south into what is now Oklahoma, and some of the
   grass-house village sites have been found and excavated for artifacts.
   Coronado did considerable exploring hereabouts, led hither and thither by
   the persistent rumours of rich cities and hidden worlds which floated
   fearfully around on the Indians' tongues. These northerly natives seemed
   more afraid and reluctant to talk about the rumoured cities and worlds
   than the Mexican Indians had been; yet at the same time seemed as if they
   could reveal a good deal more than the Mexicans had they been willing or
   dared to do so. Their vagueness exasperated the Spanish leader, and after
   many disappointing searches he began to be very severe toward those who
   brought him stories. Zamacona, more patient than Coronado, found the tales
   especially interesting; and learned enough of the local speech to hold
   long conversations with a young buck named Charging Buffalo, whose
   curiosity had led him into much stranger places than any of his
   fellow-tribesmen had dared to penetrate.

   It was Charging Buffalo who told Zamacona of the queer stone doorways,
   gates, or cave-mouths at the bottom of some of those deep, steep, wooded
   ravines which the party had noticed on the northward march. These
   openings, he said, were mostly concealed by shrubbery; and few had entered
   them for untold aeons. Those who went to where they led, never returned-or
   in a few cases returned mad or curiously maimed. But all this was legend,
   for nobody was known to have gone more than a limited distance inside any
   of them within the memory of the grandfathers of the oldest living men.
   Charging Buffalo himself had probably been farther than anyone else, and
   he had seen enough to curb both his curiosity and his greed for the
   rumoured gold below.

   Beyond the aperture he had entered there was a long passage running
   crazily up and down and round about, and covered with frightful carvings
   of monsters and horrors that no man had ever seen. At last, after untold
   miles of windings and descents, there was a glow of terrible blue light;
   and the passage opened upon a shocking nether world. About this the Indian
   would say no more, for he had seen something that had sent him back in
   haste. But the golden cities must be somewhere down there, he added, and
   perhaps a white man with the magic of the thunder-stick might succeed in
   getting to them. He would not tell the big chief Coronado what he knew,
   for Coronado would not listen to Indian talk any more. Yes-he could shew
   Zamacona the way if the white man would leave the party and accept his
   guidance. But he would not go inside the opening with the white man. It
   was bad in there.

   The place was about a five days' march to the south, near the region of
   great mounds. These mounds had something to do with the evil world down
   there-they were probably ancient closed-up passages to it, for once the
   Old Ones below had had colonies on the surface and had traded with men
   everywhere, even in the lands that had sunk under the big waters. It was
   when those lands had sunk that the Old Ones closed themselves up below and
   refused to deal with surface people. The refugees from the sinking places
   had told them that the gods of outer earth were against men, and that no
   men could survive on the outer earth unless they were daemons in league
   with the evil gods. That is why they shut out all surface folk, and did
   fearful things to any who ventured down where they dwelt. There had been
   sentries once at the various openings, but after ages they were no longer
   needed. Not many people cared to talk about the hidden Old Ones, and the
   legends about them would probably have died out but for certain ghostly
   reminders of their presence now and then. It seemed that the infinite
   ancientness of these creatures had brought them strangely near to the
   borderline of spirit, so that their ghostly emanations were more commonly
   frequent and vivid. Accordingly the region of the great mounds was often
   convulsed with spectral nocturnal battles reflecting those which had been
   fought in the days before the openings were closed.

   The Old Ones themselves were half-ghost-indeed, it was said that they no
   longer grew old or reproduced their kind, but flickered eternally in a
   state between flesh and spirit. The change was not complete, though, for
   they had to breathe. It was because the underground world needed air that
   the openings in the deep valleys were not blocked up as the mound-openings
   on the plains had been. These openings, Charging Buffalo added, were
   probably based on natural fissures in the earth. It was whispered that the
   Old Ones had come down from the stars to the world when it was very young,
   and had gone inside to build their cities of solid gold because the
   surface was not then fit to live on. They were the ancestors of all men,
   yet none could guess from what star-or what place beyond the stars-they
   came. Their hidden cities were still full of gold and silver, but men had
   better let them alone unless protected by very strong magic.

   They had frightful beasts with a faint strain of human blood, on which
   they rode, and which they employed for other purposes. The things, so
   people hinted, were carnivorous, and like their masters, preferred human
   flesh; so that although the Old Ones themselves did not breed, they had a
   sort of half-human slave-class which also served to nourish the human and
   animal population. This had been very oddly recruited, and was
   supplemented by a second slave-class of reanimated corpses. The Old Ones
   knew how to make a corpse into an automaton which would last almost
   indefinitely and perform any sort of work when directed by streams of
   thought. Charging Buffalo said that the people had all come to talk by
   means of thought only; speech having been found crude and needless, except
   for religious devotions and emotional expression, as aeons of discovery
   and study rolled by. They worshipped Yig, the great father of serpents,
   and Tulu, the octopus-headed entity that had brought them down from the
   stars; appeasing both of these hideous monstrosities by means of human
   sacrifices offered up in a very curious manner which Charging Buffalo did
   not care to describe.

   Zamacona was held spellbound by the Indian's tale, and at once resolved to
   accept his guidance to the cryptic doorway in the ravine. He did not
   believe the accounts of strange ways attributed by legend to the hidden
   people, for the experiences of the party had been such as to disillusion
   one regarding native myths of unknown lands; but he did feel that some
   sufficiently marvellous field of riches and adventure must indeed lie
   beyond the weirdly carved passages in the earth. At first he thought of
   persuading Charging Buffalo to tell his story to Coronado-offering to
   shield him against any effects of the leader's testy scepticism-but later
   he decided that a lone adventure would be better. If he had no aid, he
   would not have to share anything he found; but might perhaps become a
   great discoverer and owner of fabulous riches. Success would make him a
   greater figure than Coronado himself-perhaps a greater figure than anyone
   else in New Spain, including even the mighty viceroy Don Antonio de
   Mendoza.

   On October 7, 1541, at an hour close to midnight, Zamacona stole out of
   the Spanish camp near the grass-house village and met Charging Buffalo for
   the long southward journey. He travelled as lightly as possible, and did
   not wear his heavy helmet and breastplate. Of the details of the trip the
   manuscript told very little, but Zamacona records his arrival at the great
   ravine on October 13th. The descent of the thickly wooded slope took no
   great time; and though the Indian had trouble in locating the
   shrubbery-hidden stone door again amidst the twilight of that deep gorge,
   the place was finally found. It was a very small aperture as doorways go,
   formed of monolithic sandstone jambs and lintel, and bearing signs of
   nearly effaced and now undecipherable carvings. Its height was perhaps
   seven feet, and its width not more than four. There were drilled places in
   the jambs which argued the bygone presence of a hinged door or gate, but
   all other traces of such a thing had long since vanished.

   At sight of this black gulf Charging Buffalo displayed considerable fear,
   and threw down his pack of supplies with signs of haste. He had provided
   Zamacona with a good stock of resinous torches and provisions, and had
   guided him honestly and well; but refused to share in the venture that lay
   ahead. Zamacona gave him the trinkets he had kept for such an occasion,
   and obtained his promise to return to the region in a month; afterward
   shewing the way southward to the Pecos Pueblo villages. A prominent rock
   on the plain above them was chosen as a meeting-place; the one arriving
   first to pitch camp until the other should arrive.

   In the manuscript Zamacona expressed a wistful wonder as to the Indian's
   length of waiting at the rendezvous-for he himself could never keep that
   tryst. At the last moment Charging Buffalo tried to dissuade him from his
   plunge into the darkness, but soon saw it was futile, and gestured a
   stoical farewell. Before lighting his first torch and entering the opening
   with his ponderous pack, the Spaniard watched the lean form of the Indian
   scrambling hastily and rather relievedly upward among the trees. It was
   the cutting of his last link with the world; though he did not know that
   he was never to see a human being-in the accepted sense of that
   term-again.

   Zamacona felt no immediate premonition of evil upon entering that ominous
   doorway, though from the first he was surrounded by a bizarre and
   unwholesome atmosphere. The passage, slightly taller and wider than the
   aperture, was for many yards a level tunnel of Cyclopean masonry, with
   heavily worn flagstones under foot, and grotesquely carved granite and
   sandstone blocks in sides and ceiling. The carvings must have been
   loathsome and terrible indeed, to judge from Zamacona's description;
   according to which most of them revolved around the monstrous beings Yig
   and Tulu. They were unlike anything the adventurer had ever seen before,
   though he added that the native architecture of Mexico came closest to
   them of all things in the outer world. After some distance the tunnel
   began to dip abruptly, and irregular natural rock appeared on all sides.
   The passage seemed only partly artificial, and decorations were limited to
   occasional cartouches with shocking bas-reliefs.

   Following an enormous descent, whose steepness at times produced an acute
   danger of slipping and tobogganing, the passage became exceedingly
   uncertain in its direction and variable in its contour. At times it
   narrowed almost to a slit or grew so low that stooping and even crawling
   were necessary, while at other times it broadened out into sizeable caves
   or chains of caves. Very little human construction, it was plain, had gone
   into this part of the tunnel; though occasionally a sinister cartouche or
   hieroglyphic on the wall, or a blocked-up lateral passageway, would remind
   Zamacona that this was in truth the aeon-forgotten high-road to a primal
   and unbelievable world of living things.

   For three days, as best he could reckon, Panfilo de Zamacona scrambled
   down, up, along, and around, but always predominately downward, through
   this dark region of palaeogean night. Once in a while he heard some secret
   being of darkness patter or flap out of his way, and on just one occasion
   he half glimpsed a great, bleached thing that set him trembling. The
   quality of the air was mostly very tolerable; though foetid zones were now
   and then met with, while one great cavern of stalactites and stalagmites
   afforded a depressing dampness. This latter, when Charging Buffalo had
   come upon it, had quite seriously barred the way; since the limestone
   deposits of ages had built fresh pillars in the path of the primordial
   abyss-denizens. The Indian, however, had broken through these; so that
   Zamacona did not find his course impeded. It was an unconscious comfort to
   him to reflect that someone else from the outside world had been there
   before-and the Indian's careful descriptions had removed the element of
   surprise and unexpectedness. More-Charging Buffalo's knowledge of the
   tunnel had led him to provide so good a torch supply for the journey in
   and out, that there would be no danger of becoming stranded in darkness.
   Zamacona camped twice, building a fire whose smoke seemed well taken care
   of by the natural ventilation.

   At what he considered the end of the third day-though his cocksure
   guesswork chronology is not at any time to be given the easy faith that he
   gave it-Zamacona encountered the prodigious descent and subsequent
   prodigious climb which Charging Buffalo had described as the tunnel's last
   phase. As at certain earlier points, marks of artificial improvement were
   here discernible; and several times the steep gradient was eased by a
   flight of rough-hewn steps. The torch shewed more and more of the
   monstrous carvings on the walls, and finally the resinous flare seemed
   mixed with a fainter and more diffusive light as Zamacona climbed up and
   up after the last downward stairway. At length the ascent ceased, and a
   level passage of artificial masonry with dark, basaltic blocks led
   straight ahead. There was no need for a torch now, for all the air was
   glowing with a bluish, quasi-electric radiance that flickered like an
   aurora. It was the strange light of the inner world that the Indian had
   described-and in another moment Zamacona emerged from the tunnel upon a
   bleak, rocky hillside which climbed above him to a seething, impenetrable
   sky of bluish coruscations, and descended dizzily below him to an
   apparently illimitable plain shrouded in bluish mist.

   He had come to the unknown world at last, and from his manuscript it is
   clear that he viewed the formless landscape as proudly and exaltedly as
   ever his fellow-countryman Balboa viewed the new-found Pacific from that
   unforgettable peak in Darien. Charging Buffalo had turned back at this
   point, driven by fear of something which he would only describe vaguely
   and evasively as a herd of bad cattle, neither horse nor buffalo, but like
   the things the mound-spirits rode at night-but Zamacona could not be
   deterred by any such trifle. Instead of fear, a strange sense of glory
   filled him; for he had imagination enough to know what it meant to stand
   alone in an inexplicable nether world whose existence no other white man
   suspected.

   The soil of the great hill that surged upward behind him and spread
   steeply downward below him was dark grey, rock-strown, without vegetation,
   and probably basaltic in origin; with an unearthly cast which made him
   feel like an intruder on an alien planet. The vast distant plain,
   thousands of feet below, had no features he could distinguish; especially
   since it appeared to be largely veiled in a curling, bluish vapour. But
   more than hill or plain or cloud, the bluely luminous, coruscating sky
   impressed the adventurer with a sense of supreme wonder and mystery. What
   created this sky within a world he could not tell; though he knew of the
   northern lights, and had even seen them once or twice. He concluded that
   this subterraneous light was something vaguely akin to the aurora; a view
   which moderns may well endorse, though it seems likely that certain
   phenomena of radio-activity may also enter in.

   At Zamacona's back the mouth of the tunnel he had traversed yawned darkly;
   defined by a stone doorway very like the one he had entered in the world
   above, save that it was of greyish-black basalt instead of red sandstone.
   There were hideous sculptures, still in good preservation and perhaps
   corresponding to those on the outer portal which time had largely
   weathered away. The absence of weathering here argued a dry, temperate
   climate; indeed, the Spaniard already began to note the delightfully
   spring-like stability of temperature which marks the air of the north's
   interior. On the stone jambs were works proclaiming the bygone presence of
   hinges, but of any actual door or gate no trace remained. Seating himself
   for rest and thought, Zamacona lightened his pack by removing an amount of
   food and torches sufficient to take him back through the tunnel. These he
   proceeded to cache at the opening, under a cairn hastily formed of the
   rock fragments which everywhere lay around. Then, readjusting his
   lightened pack, he commenced his descent toward the distant plain;
   preparing to invade a region which no living thing of outer earth had
   penetrated in a century or more, which no white man had ever penetrated,
   and from which, if legend were to be believed, no organic creature had
   ever returned sane.

   Zamacona strode briskly along down the steep, interminable slope; his
   progress checked at times by the bad walking that came from loose rock
   fragments, or by the excessive precipitousness of the grade. The distance
   of the mist-shrouded plain must have been enormous, for many hours'
   walking brought him apparently no closer to it than he had been before.
   Behind him was always the great hill stretching upward into a bright
   aerial sea of bluish coruscations. Silence was universal; so that his own
   footsteps, and the fall of stones that he dislodged, struck on his ears
   with startling distinctness. It was at what he regarded as about noon that
   he first saw the abnormal footprints which set him to thinking of Charging
   Buffalo's terrible hints, precipitate flight, and strangely abiding
   terror.

   The rock-strown nature of the soil gave few opportunities for tracks of
   any kind, but at one point a rather level interval had caused the loose
   detritus to accumulate in a ridge, leaving a considerable area of
   dark-grey loam absolutely bare. Here, in a rambling confusion indicating a
   large herd aimlessly wandering, Zamacona found the abnormal prints. It is
   to be regretted that he could not describe them more exactly, but the
   manuscript displayed far more vague fear than accurate observation. Just
   what it was that so frightened the Spaniard can only be inferred from his
   later hints regarding the beasts. He referred to the prints as "not
   hooves, nor hands, nor feet, nor precisely paws-nor so large as to cause
   alarm on that account". Just why or how long ago the things had been
   there, was not easy to guess. There was no vegetation visible, hence
   grazing was out of the question; but of course if the beasts were
   carnivorous they might well have been hunting smaller animals, whose
   tracks their own would tend to obliterate.

   Glancing backward from this plateau to the heights above, Zamacona thought
   he detected traces of a great winding road which had once led from the
   tunnel downward to the plain. One could get the impression of this former
   highway only from a broad panoramic view, since a trickle of loose rock
   fragments had long ago obscured it; but the adventurer felt none the less
   certain that it had existed. It had not, probably, been an elaborately
   paved trunk route; for the small tunnel it reached seemed scarcely like a
   main avenue to the outer world. In choosing a straight path of descent
   Zamacona had not followed its curving course, though he must have crossed
   it once or twice. With his attention now called to it, he looked ahead to
   see if he could trace it downward toward the plain; and this he finally
   thought he could do. He resolved to investigate its surface when next he
   crossed it, and perhaps to pursue its line for the rest of the way if he
   could distinguish it.

   Having resumed his journey, Zamacona came some time later upon what he
   thought was a bend of the ancient road. There were signs of grading and of
   some primal attempt at rock-surfacing, but not enough was left to make the
   route worth following. While rummaging about in the soil with his sword,
   the Spaniard turned up something that glittered in the eternal blue
   daylight, and was thrilled at beholding a kind of coin or medal of a dark,
   unknown, lustrous metal, with hideous designs on each side. It was utterly
   and bafflingly alien to him, and from his description I have no doubt but
   that it was a duplicate of the talisman given me by Grey Eagle almost four
   centuries afterward. Pocketing it after a long and curious examination, he
   strode onward; finally pitching camp at an hour which he guessed to be the
   evening of the outer world.

   The next day Zamacona rose early and resumed his descent through this
   blue-litten world of mist and desolation and preternatural silence. As he
   advanced, he at last became able to distinguish a few objects on the
   distant plain below-trees, bushes, rocks, and a small river that came into
   view from the right and curved forward at a point to the left of his
   contemplated course. This river seemed to be spanned by a bridge connected
   with the descending roadway, and with care the explorer could trace the
   route of the road beyond it in a straight line over the plain. Finally he
   even thought he could detect towns scattered along the rectilinear ribbon;
   towns whose left-hand edges reached the river and sometimes crossed it.
   Where such crossings occurred, he saw as he descended, there were always
   signs of bridges either ruined or surviving. He was now in the midst of a
   sparse grassy vegetation, and saw that below him the growth became thicker
   and thicker. The road was easier to define now, since its surface
   discouraged the grass which the looser soil supported. Rock fragments were
   less frequent, and the barren upward vista behind him looked bleak and
   forbidding in contrast to his present milieu.

   It was on this day that he saw the blurred mass moving over the distant
   plain. Since his first sight of the sinister footprints he had met with no
   more of these, but something about that slowly and deliberately moving
   mass peculiarly sickened him. Nothing but a herd of grazing animals could
   move just like that, and after seeing the footprints he did not wish to
   meet the things which had made them. Still, the moving mass was not near
   the road-and his curiosity and greed for fabled gold were great. Besides,
   who could really judge things from vague, jumbled footprints or from the
   panic-twisted hints of an ignorant Indian?

   In straining his eyes to view the moving mass Zamacona became aware of
   several other interesting things. One was that certain parts of the now
   unmistakable towns glittered oddly in the misty blue light. Another was
   that, besides the towns, several similarly glittering structures of a more
   isolated sort were scattered here and there along the road and over the
   plain. They seemed to be embowered in clumps of vegetation, and those off
   the road had small avenues leading to the highway. No smoke or other signs
   of life could be discerned about any of the towns or buildings. Finally
   Zamacona saw that the plain was not infinite in extent, though the
   half-concealing blue mists had hitherto made it seem so. It was bounded in
   the remote distance by a range of low hills, toward a gap in which the
   river and roadway seemed to lead. All this-especially the glittering of
   certain pinnacles in the towns-had become very vivid when Zamacona pitched
   his second camp amidst the endless blue day. He likewise noticed the
   flocks of high-soaring birds, whose nature he could not clearly make out.

   The next afternoon-to use the language of the outer world as the
   manuscript did at all times-Zamacona reached the silent plain and crossed
   the soundless, slow-running river on a curiously carved and fairly
   well-preserved bridge of black basalt. The water was clear, and contained
   large fishes of a wholly strange aspect. The roadway was now paved and
   somewhat overgrown with weeds and creeping vines, and its course was
   occasionally outlined by small pillars bearing obscure symbols. On every
   side the grassy level extended, with here and there a clump of trees or
   shrubbery, and with unidentifiable bluish flowers growing irregularly over
   the whole area. Now and then some spasmodic motion of the grass indicated
   the presence of serpents. In the course of several hours the traveller
   reached a grove of old and alien-looking evergreen-trees which he knew,
   from distant viewing, protected one of the glittering-roofed isolated
   structures. Amidst the encroaching vegetation he saw the hideously
   sculptured pylons of a stone gateway leading off the road, and was
   presently forcing his way through briers above a moss-crusted tessellated
   walk lined with huge trees and low monolithic pillars.

   At last, in this hushed green twilight, he saw the crumbling and ineffably
   ancient facade of the building-a temple, he had no doubt. It was a mass of
   nauseous bas-reliefs; depicting scenes and beings, objects and ceremonies,
   which could certainly have no place on this or any sane planet. In hinting
   of these things Zamacona displays for the first time that shocked and
   pious hesitancy which impairs the informative value of the rest of his
   manuscript. We cannot help regretting that the Catholic ardour of
   Renaissance Spain had so thoroughly permeated his thought and feeling. The
   door of the place stood wide open, and absolute darkness filled the
   windowless interior. Conquering the repulsion which the mural sculptures
   had excited, Zamacona took out flint and steel, lighted a resinous torch,
   pushed aside curtaining vines, and sallied boldly across the ominous
   threshold.

   For a moment he was quite stupefied by what he saw. It was not the
   all-covering dust and cobwebs of immemorial aeons, the fluttering winged
   things, the shriekingly loathsome sculptures on the walls, the bizarre
   form of the many basins and braziers, the sinister pyramidal altar with
   the hollow top, or the monstrous, octopus-headed abnormality in some
   strange, dark metal leering and squatting broodingly on its hieroglyphed
   pedestal, which robbed him of even the power to give a startled cry. It
   was nothing so unearthly as this-but merely the fact that, with the
   exception of the dust, the cobwebs, the winged things, and the gigantic
   emerald-eyed idol, every particle of substance in sight was composed of
   pure and evidently solid gold.

   Even the manuscript, written in retrospect after Zamacona knew that gold
   is the most common structural metal of a nether world containing limitless
   lodes and veins of it, reflects the frenzied excitement which the
   traveller felt upon suddenly finding the real source of all the Indian
   legends of golden cities. For a time the power of detailed observation
   left him, but in the end his faculties were recalled by a peculiar tugging
   sensation in the pocket of his doublet. Tracing the feeling, he realised
   that the disc of strange metal he had found in the abandoned road was
   being attracted strongly by the vast octopus-headed, emerald-eyed idol on
   the pedestal, which he now saw to be composed of the same unknown exotic
   metal. He was later to learn that this strange magnetic substance-as alien
   to the inner world as to the outer world of men-is the one precious metal
   of the blue-lighted abyss. None knows what it is or where it occurs in
   Nature, and the amount of it on this planet came down from the stars with
   the people when great Tulu, the octopus-headed god, brought them for the
   first time to this earth. Certainly, its only known source was a stock of
   pre-existing artifacts, including multitudes of Cyclopean idols. It could
   never be placed or analysed, and even its magnetism was exerted only on
   its own kind. It was the supreme ceremonial metal of the hidden people,
   its use being regulated by custom in such a way that its magnetic
   properties might cause no inconvenience. A very weakly magnetic alloy of
   it with such base metals as iron, gold, silver, copper, or zinc, had
   formed the sole monetary standard of the hidden people at one period of
   their history.

   Zamacona's reflections on the strange idol and its magnetism were
   disturbed by a tremendous wave of fear as, for the first time in this
   silent world, he heard a rumble of very definite and obviously approaching
   sound. There was no mistaking its nature. It was a thunderously charging
   herd of large animals; and, remembering the Indian's panic, the
   footprints, and the moving mass distantly seen, the Spaniard shuddered in
   terrified anticipation. He did not analyse his position, or the
   significance of this onrush of great lumbering beings, but merely
   responded to an elemental urge toward self-protection. Charging herds do
   not stop to find victims in obscure places, and on the outer earth
   Zamacona would have felt little or no alarm in such a massive, grove-girt
   edifice. Some instinct, however, now bred a deep and peculiar terror in
   his soul; and he looked about frantically for any means of safety.

   There being no available refuge in the great, gold-patined interior, he
   felt that he must close the long-disused door; which still hung on its
   ancient hinges, doubled back against the inner wall. Soil, vines, and moss
   had entered the opening from outside, so that he had to dig a path for the
   great gold portal with his sword; but he managed to perform this work very
   swiftly under the frightful stimulus of the approaching noise. The
   hoofbeats had grown still louder and more menacing by the time he began
   tugging at the heavy door itself; and for a while his fears reached a
   frantic height, as hope of starting the age-clogged metal grew faint.
   Then, with a creak, the thing responded to his youthful strength, and a
   frenzied siege of pulling and pushing ensued. Amidst the roar of unseen
   stampeding feet success came at last, and the ponderous golden door
   clanged shut, leaving Zamacona in darkness but for the single lighted
   torch he had wedged between the pillars of a basin-tripod. There was a
   latch, and the frightened man blessed his patron saint that it was still
   effective.

   Sound alone told the fugitive the sequel. When the roar grew very near it
   resolved itself into separate footfalls, as if the evergreen grove had
   made it necessary for the herd to slacken speed and disperse. But feet
   continued to approach, and it became evident that the beasts were
   advancing among the trees and circling the hideously carven temple walls.
   In the curious deliberation of their tread Zamacona found something very
   alarming and repulsive, nor did he like the scuffling sounds which were
   audible even through the thick stone walls and heavy golden door. Once the
   door rattled ominously on its archaic hinges, as if under a heavy impact,
   but fortunately it still held. Then, after a seemingly endless interval,
   he heard retreating steps and realised that his unknown visitors were
   leaving. Since the herds did not seem to be very numerous, it would have
   perhaps been safe to venture out within a half-hour or less; but Zamacona
   took no chances. Opening his pack, he prepared his camp on the golden
   tiles of the temple's floor, with the great door still securely latched
   against all comers; drifting eventually into a sounder sleep than he could
   have known in the blue-litten spaces outside. He did not even mind the
   hellish, octopus-headed bulk of great Tulu, fashioned of unknown metal and
   leering with fishy, sea-green eyes, which squatted in the blackness above
   him on its monstrously hieroglyphed pedestal.

   Surrounded by darkness for the first time since leaving the tunnel,
   Zamacona slept profoundly and long. He must have more than made up the
   sleep he had lost at his two previous camps, when the ceaseless glare of
   the sky had kept him awake despite his fatigue, for much distance was
   covered by other living feet while he lay in his healthily dreamless rest.
   It is well that he rested deeply, for there were many strange things to be
   encountered in his next period of consciousness.

                                      IV.

   What finally roused Zamacona was a thunderous rapping at the door. It beat
   through his dreams and dissolved all the lingering mists of drowsiness as
   soon as he knew what it was. There could be no mistake about it-it was a
   definite, human, and peremptory rapping; performed apparently with some
   metallic object, and with all the measured quality of conscious thought or
   will behind it. As the awakening man rose clumsily to his feet, a sharp
   vocal note was added to the summons-someone calling out, in a not
   unmusical voice, a formula which the manuscript tries to represent as
   "oxi, oxi, giathcan yca relex". Feeling sure that his visitors were men
   and not daemons, and arguing that they could have no reason for
   considering him an enemy, Zamacona decided to face them openly and at
   once; and accordingly fumbled with the ancient latch till the golden door
   creaked open from the pressure of those outside.

   As the great portal swung back, Zamacona stood facing a group of about
   twenty individuals of an aspect not calculated to give him alarm. They
   seemed to be Indians; though their tasteful robes and trappings and swords
   were not such as he had seen among any of the tribes of the outer world,
   while their faces had many subtle differences from the Indian type. That
   they did not mean to be irresponsibly hostile, was very clear; for instead
   of menacing him in any way they merely probed him attentively and
   significantly with their eyes, as if they expected their gaze to open up
   some sort of communication. The longer they gazed, the more he seemed to
   know about them and their mission; for although no one had spoken since
   the vocal summons before the opening of the door, he found himself slowly
   realising that they had come from the great city beyond the low hills,
   mounted on animals, and that they had been summoned by animals who had
   reported his presence; that they were not sure what kind of person he was
   or just where he had come from but that they knew he must be associated
   with that dimly remembered outer world which they sometimes visited in
   curious dreams. How he read all this in the gaze of the two or three
   leaders he could not possibly explain; though he learned why a moment
   later.

   As it was, he attempted to address his visitors in the Wichita dialect he
   had picked up from Charging Buffalo; and after this failed to draw a vocal
   reply he successively tried the Aztec, Spanish, French, and Latin
   tongues-adding as many scraps of lame Greek, Galician, and Portuguese, and
   of the Bable peasant patois of his native Asturias, as his memory could
   recall. But not even this polyglot array-his entire linguistic stock-could
   bring a reply in kind. When, however, he paused in perplexity, one of the
   visitors began speaking in an utterly strange and rather fascinating
   language whose sounds the Spaniard later had much difficulty in
   representing on paper. Upon his failure to understand this, the speaker
   pointed first to his own eyes, then to his forehead, and then to his eyes
   again, as if commanding the other to gaze at him in order to absorb what
   he wanted to transmit.

   Zamacona, obeying, found himself rapidly in possession of certain
   information. The people, he learned, conversed nowadays by means of
   unvocal radiations of thought; although they had formerly used a spoken
   language which still survived as the written tongue, and into which they
   still dropped orally for tradition's sake, or when strong feeling demanded
   a spontaneous outlet. He could understand them merely by concentrating his
   attention upon their eyes; and could reply by summoning up a mental image
   of what he wished to say, and throwing the substance of this into his
   glance. When the thought-speaker paused, apparently inviting a response,
   Zamacona tried his best to follow the prescribed pattern, but did not
   appear to succeed very well. So he nodded, and tried to describe himself
   and his journey by signs. He pointed upward, as if to the outer world,
   then closed his eyes and made signs as of a mole burrowing. Then he opened
   his eyes again and pointed downward, in order to indicate his descent of
   the great slope. Experimentally he blended a spoken word or two with his
   gestures-for example, pointing successively to himself and to all of his
   visitors and saying "un hombre", and then pointing to himself alone and
   very carefully pronouncing his individual name, Panfilo de Zamacona.

   Before the strange conversation was over, a good deal of data had passed
   in both directions. Zamacona had begun to learn how to throw his thoughts,
   and had likewise picked up several words of the region's archaic spoken
   language. His visitors, moreover, had absorbed many beginnings of an
   elementary Spanish vocabulary. Their own old language was utterly unlike
   anything the Spaniard had ever heard, though there were times later on
   when he was to fancy an infinitely remote linkage with the Aztec, as if
   the latter represented some far stage of corruption, or some very thin
   infiltration of loan-words. The underground world, Zamacona learned, bore
   an ancient name which the manuscript records as "Xinaian"; but which, from
   the writer's supplementary explanations and diacritical marks, could
   probably be best represented to Anglo-Saxon ears by the phonetic
   arrangement K'n-yan.

   It is not surprising that this preliminary discourse did not go beyond the
   merest essentials, but those essentials were highly important. Zamacona
   learned that the people of K'n-yan were almost infinitely ancient, and
   that they had come from a distant part of space where physical conditions
   are much like those of the earth. All this, of course, was legend now; and
   one could not say how much truth was in it, or how much worship was really
   due to the octopus-headed being Tulu who had traditionally brought them
   hither and whom they still reverenced for aesthetic reasons. But they knew
   of the outer world, and were indeed the original stock who had peopled it
   as soon as its crust was fit to live on. Between glacial ages they had had
   some remarkable surface civilisations, especially one at the South Pole
   near the mountain Kadath.

   At some time infinitely in the past most of the outer world had sunk
   beneath the ocean, so that only a few refugees remained to bear the news
   to K'n-yan. This was undoubtedly due to the wrath of space-devils hostile
   alike to men and to men's gods-for it bore out rumours of a primordially
   earlier sinking which had submerged the gods themselves, including great
   Tulu, who still lay prisoned and dreaming in the watery vaults of the
   half-cosmic city Relex. No man not a slave of the space-devils, it was
   argued, could live long on the outer earth; and it was decided that all
   beings who remained there must be evilly connected. Accordingly traffic
   with the lands of sun and starlight abruptly ceased. The subterraneous
   approaches to K'n-yan, or such as could be remembered, were either blocked
   up or carefully guarded; and all encroachers were treated as dangerous
   spies and enemies.

   But this was long ago. With the passing of ages fewer and fewer visitors
   came to K'n-yan, and eventually sentries ceased to be maintained at the
   unblocked approaches. The mass of the people forgot, except through
   distorted memories and myths and some very singular dreams, that an outer
   world existed; though educated folk never ceased to recall the essential
   facts. The last visitors ever recorded-centuries in the past-had not even
   been treated as devil-spies; faith in the old legendry having long before
   died out. They had been questioned eagerly about the fabulous outer
   regions; for scientific curiosity in K'n-yan was keen, and the myths,
   memories, dreams, and historical fragments relating to the earth's surface
   had often tempted scholars to the brink of an external expedition which
   they had not quite dared to attempt. The only thing demanded of such
   visitors was that they refrain from going back and informing the outer
   world of K'n-yan's positive existence; for after all, one could not be
   sure about these outer lands. They coveted gold and silver, and might
   prove highly troublesome intruders. Those who had obeyed the injunction
   had lived happily, though regrettably briefly, and had told all they could
   about their world-little enough, however, since their accounts were all so
   fragmentary and conflicting that one could hardly tell what to believe and
   what to doubt. One wished that more of them would come. As for those who
   disobeyed and tried to escape-it was very unfortunate about them. Zamacona
   himself was very welcome, for he appeared to be a higher-grade man, and to
   know much more about the outer world, than anyone else who had come down
   within memory. He could tell them much-and they hoped he would be
   reconciled to his lifelong stay.

   Many things which Zamacona learned about K'n-yan in that first colloquy
   left him quite breathless. He learned, for instance, that during the past
   few thousand years the phenomena of old age and death had been conquered;
   so that men no longer grew feeble or died except through violence or will.
   By regulating the system, one might be as physiologically young and
   immortal as he wished; and the only reason why any allowed themselves to
   age, was that they enjoyed the sensation in a world where stagnation and
   commonplaceness reigned. They could easily become young again when they
   felt like it. Births had ceased, except for experimental purposes, since a
   large population had been found needless by a master-race which controlled
   Nature and organic rivals alike. Many, however, chose to die after a
   while; since despite the cleverest efforts to invent new pleasures, the
   ordeal of consciousness became too dull for sensitive souls-especially
   those in whom time and satiation had blinded the primal instincts and
   emotions of self-preservation. All the members of the group before
   Zamacona were from 500 to 1500 years old; and several had seen surface
   visitors before, though time had blurred the recollection. These visitors,
   by the way, had often tried to duplicate the longevity of the underground
   race; but had been able to do so only fractionally, owing to evolutionary
   differences developing during the million or two years of cleavage.

   These evolutionary differences were even more strikingly shewn in another
   particular-one far stranger than the wonder of immortality itself. This
   was the ability of the people of K'n-yan to regulate the balance between
   matter and abstract energy, even where the bodies of living organic beings
   were concerned, by the sheer force of the technically trained will. In
   other words, with suitable effort a learned man of K'n-yan could
   dematerialise and rematerialise himself-or, with somewhat greater effort
   and subtler technique, any other object he chose; reducing solid matter to
   free external particles and recombining the particles again without
   damage. Had not Zamacona answered his visitors' knock when he did, he
   would have discovered this accomplishment in a highly puzzling way; for
   only the strain and bother of the process prevented the twenty men from
   passing bodily through the golden door without pausing for a summons. This
   art was much older than the art of perpetual life; and it could be taught
   to some extent, though never perfectly, to any intelligent person. Rumours
   of it had reached the outer world in past aeons; surviving in secret
   traditions and ghostly legendry. The men of K'n-yan had been amused by the
   primitive and imperfect spirit tales brought down by outer-world
   stragglers. In practical life this principle had certain industrial
   applications, but was generally suffered to remain neglected through lack
   of any particular incentive to its use. Its chief surviving form was in
   connexion with sleep, when for excitement's sake many dream-connoisseurs
   resorted to it to enhance the vividness of their visionary wanderings. By
   the aid of this method certain dreamers even paid half-material visits to
   a strange, nebulous realm of mounds and valleys and varying light which
   some believed to be the forgotten outer world. They would go thither on
   their beasts, and in an age of peace live over the old, glorious battles
   of their forefathers. Some philosophers thought that in such cases they
   actually coalesced with immaterial forces left behind by these warlike
   ancestors themselves.

   The people of K'n-yan all dwelt in the great, tall city of Tsath beyond
   the mountains. Formerly several races of them had inhabited the entire
   underground world, which stretched down to unfathomable abysses and which
   included besides the blue-litten region a red-litten region called Yoth,
   where relics of a still older and non-human race were found by
   archaeologists. In the course of time, however, the men of Tsath had
   conquered and enslaved the rest; interbreeding them with certain horned
   and four-footed animals of the red-litten region, whose semi-human
   leanings were very peculiar, and which, though containing a certain
   artificially created element, may have been in part the degenerate
   descendants of those peculiar entities who had left the relics. As aeons
   passed, and mechanical discoveries made the business of life extremely
   easy, a concentration of the people of Tsath took place; so that all the
   rest of K'n-yan became relatively deserted.

   It was easier to live in one place, and there was no object in maintaining
   a population of overflowing proportions. Many of the old mechanical
   devices were still in use, though others had been abandoned when it was
   seen that they failed to give pleasure, or that they were not necessary
   for a race of reduced numbers whose mental force could govern an extensive
   array of inferior and semihuman industrial organisms. This extensive
   slave-class was highly composite, being bred from ancient conquered
   enemies, from outer-world stragglers, from dead bodies curiously
   galvanised into effectiveness, and from the naturally inferior members of
   the ruling race of Tsath. The ruling type itself had become highly
   superior through selective breeding and social evolution-the nation having
   passed through a period of idealistic industrial democracy which gave
   equal opportunities to all, and thus, by raising the naturally intelligent
   to power, drained the masses of all their brains and stamina. Industry,
   being found fundamentally futile except for the supplying of basic needs
   and the gratification of inescapable yearnings, had become very simple.
   Physical comfort was ensured by an urban mechanisation of standardised and
   easily maintained pattern, and other elemental needs were supplied by
   scientific agriculture and stock-raising. Long travel was abandoned, and
   people went back to using the horned, half-human beasts instead of
   maintaining the profusion of gold, silver, and steel transportation
   machines which had once threaded land, water, and air. Zamacona could
   scarcely believe that such things had ever existed outside dreams, but was
   told he could see specimens of them in museums. He could also see the
   ruins of other vast magical devices by travelling a day's journey to the
   valley of Do-Hna, to which the race had spread during its period of
   greatest numbers. The cities and temples of this present plain were of a
   far more archaic period, and had never been other than religious and
   antiquarian shrines during the supremacy of the men of Tsath.

   In government, Tsath was a kind of communistic or semi-anarchical state;
   habit rather than law determining the daily order of things. This was made
   possible by the age-old experience and paralysing ennui of the race, whose
   wants and needs were limited to physical fundamentals and to new
   sensations. An aeon-long tolerance not yet undermined by growing reaction
   had abolished all illusions of values and principles, and nothing but an
   approximation to custom was ever sought or expected. To see that the
   mutual encroachments of pleasure-seeking never crippled the mass life of
   the community-this was all that was desired. Family organisation had long
   ago perished, and the civil and social distinction of the sexes had
   disappeared. Daily life was organised in ceremonial patterns; with games,
   intoxication, torture of slaves, day-dreaming, gastronomic and emotional
   orgies, religious exercises, exotic experiments, artistic and
   philosophical discussions, and the like, as the principal occupations.
   Property-chiefly land, slaves, animals, shares in the common city
   enterprise of Tsath, and ingots of magnetic Tulu-metal, the former
   universal money standard-was allocated on a very complex basis which
   included a certain amount equally divided among all the freemen. Poverty
   was unknown, and labour consisted only of certain administrative duties
   imposed by an intricate system of testing and selection. Zamacona found
   difficulty in describing conditions so unlike anything he had previously
   known; and the text of his manuscript proved unusually puzzling at this
   point.

   Art and intellect, it appeared, had reached very high levels in Tsath; but
   had become listless and decadent. The dominance of machinery had at one
   time broken up the growth of normal aesthetics, introducing a lifelessly
   geometrical tradition fatal to sound expression. This had soon been
   outgrown, but had left its mark upon all pictorial and decorative
   attempts; so that except for conventionalised religious designs, there was
   little depth or feeling in any later work. Archaistic reproductions of
   earlier work had been found much preferable for general enjoyment.
   Literature was all highly individual and analytical, so much so as to be
   wholly incomprehensible to Zamacona. Science had been profound and
   accurate, and all-embracing save in the one direction of astronomy. Of
   late, however, it was falling into decay, as people found it increasingly
   useless to tax their minds by recalling its maddening infinitude of
   details and ramifications. It was thought more sensible to abandon the
   deepest speculations and to confine philosophy to conventional forms.
   Technology, of course, could be carried on by rule of thumb. History was
   more and more neglected, but exact and copious chronicles of the past
   existed in the libraries. It was still an interesting subject, and there
   would be a vast number to rejoice at the fresh outer-world knowledge
   brought in by Zamacona. In general, though, the modern tendency was to
   feel rather than to think; so that men were now more highly esteemed for
   inventing new diversions than for preserving old facts or pushing back the
   frontier of cosmic mystery.

   Religion was a leading interest in Tsath, though very few actually
   believed in the supernatural. What was desired was the aesthetic and
   emotional exaltation bred by the mystical moods and sensuous rites which
   attended the colourful ancestral faith. Temples to Great Tulu, a spirit of
   universal harmony anciently symbolised as the octopus-headed god who had
   brought all men down from the stars, were the most richly constructed
   objects in all K'n-yan; while the cryptic shrines of Yig, the principle of
   life symbolised as the Father of all Serpents, were almost as lavish and
   remarkable. In time Zamacona learned much of the orgies and sacrifices
   connected with this religion, but seemed piously reluctant to describe
   them in his manuscript. He himself never participated in any of the rites
   save those which he mistook for perversions of his own faith; nor did he
   ever lose an opportunity to try to convert the people to that faith of the
   Cross which the Spaniards hoped to make universal.

   Prominent in the contemporary religion of Tsath was a revived and almost
   genuine veneration for the rare, sacred metal of Tulu-that dark, lustrous,
   magnetic stuff which was nowhere found in Nature, but which had always
   been with men in the form of idols and hieratic implements. From the
   earliest times any sight of it in its unalloyed form had impelled respect,
   while all the sacred archives and litanies were kept in cylinders wrought
   of its purest substance. Now, as the neglect of science and intellect was
   dulling the critically analytical spirit, people were beginning to weave
   around the metal once more that same fabric of awestruck superstition
   which had existed in primitive times.

   Another function of religion was the regulation of the calendar, born of a
   period when time and speed were regarded as prime fetiches in man's
   emotional life. Periods of alternate waking and sleeping, prolonged,
   abridged, and inverted as mood and convenience dictated, and timed by the
   tail-beats of Great Yig, the Serpent, corresponded very roughly to
   terrestrial days and nights; though Zamacona's sensations told him they
   must actually be almost twice as long. The year-unit, measured by Yig's
   annual shedding of his skin, was equal to about a year and a half of the
   outer world. Zamacona thought he had mastered this calendar very well when
   he wrote his manuscript, whence the confidently given date of 1545; but
   the document failed to suggest that his assurance in this matter was fully
   justified.

   As the spokesman of the Tsath party proceeded with his information,
   Zamacona felt a growing repulsion and alarm. It was not only what was
   told, but the strange, telepathic manner of telling, and the plain
   inference that return to the outer world would be impossible, that made
   the Spaniard wish he had never descended to this region of magic,
   abnormality, and decadence. But he knew that nothing but friendly
   acquiescence would do as a policy, hence decided to cooperate in all his
   visitors' plans and furnish all the information they might desire. They,
   on their part, were fascinated by the outer-world data which he managed
   haltingly to convey.

   It was really the first draught of reliable surface information they had
   had since the refugees straggled back from Atlantis and Lemuria aeons
   before, for all their subsequent emissaries from outside had been members
   of narrow and local groups without any knowledge of the world at
   large-Mayas, Toltecs, and Aztecs at best, and mostly ignorant tribes of
   the plains. Zamacona was the first European they had ever seen, and the
   fact that he was a youth of education and brilliancy made him of still
   more emphatic value as a source of knowledge. The visiting party shewed
   their breathless interest in all he contrived to convey, and it was plain
   that his coming would do much to relieve the flagging interest of weary
   Tsath in matters of geography and history.

   The only thing which seemed to displease the men of Tsath was the fact
   that curious and adventurous strangers were beginning to pour into those
   parts of the upper world where the passages to K'n-yan lay. Zamacona told
   them of the founding of Florida and New Spain, and made it clear that a
   great part of the world was stirring with the zest of adventure-Spanish,
   Portuguese, French, and English. Sooner or later Mexico and Florida must
   meet in one great colonial empire-and then it would be hard to keep
   outsiders from the rumoured gold and silver of the abyss. Charging Buffalo
   knew of Zamacona's journey into the earth. Would he tell Coronado, or
   somehow let a report get to the great viceroy, when he failed to find the
   traveller at the promised meeting-place? Alarm for the continued secrecy
   and safety of K'n-yan shewed in the faces of the visitors, and Zamacona
   absorbed from their minds the fact that from now on sentries would
   undoubtedly be posted once more at all the unblocked passages to the
   outside world which the men of Tsath could remember.

                                       V.

   The long conversation of Zamacona and his visitors took place in the
   green-blue twilight of the grove just outside the temple door. Some of the
   men reclined on the weeds and moss beside the half-vanished walk, while
   others, including the Spaniard and the chief spokesman of the Tsath party,
   sat on the occasional low monolithic pillars that lined the temple
   approach. Almost a whole terrestrial day must have been consumed in the
   colloquy, for Zamacona felt the need of food several times, and ate from
   his well-stocked pack while some of the Tsath party went back for
   provisions to the roadway, where they had left the animals on which they
   had ridden. At length the prime leader of the party brought the discourse
   to a close, and indicated that the time had come to proceed to the city.

   There were, he affirmed, several extra beasts in the cavalcade, upon one
   of which Zamacona could ride. The prospect of mounting one of those
   ominous hybrid entities whose fabled nourishment was so alarming, and a
   single sight of which had set Charging Buffalo into such a frenzy of
   flight, was by no means reassuring to the traveller. There was, moreover,
   another point about the things which disturbed him greatly-the apparently
   preternatural intelligence with which some members of the previous day's
   roving pack had reported his presence to the men of Tsath and brought out
   the present expedition. But Zamacona was not a coward, hence followed the
   men boldly down the weed-grown walk toward the road where the things were
   stationed.

   And yet he could not refrain from crying out in terror at what he saw when
   he passed through the great vine-draped pylons and emerged upon the
   ancient road. He did not wonder that the curious Wichita had fled in
   panic, and had to close his eyes a moment to retain his sanity. It is
   unfortunate that some sense of pious reticence prevented him from
   describing fully in his manuscript the nameless sight he saw. As it is, he
   merely hinted at the shocking morbidity of these great floundering white
   things, with black fur on their backs, a rudimentary horn in the centre of
   their foreheads, and an unmistakable trace of human or anthropoid blood in
   their flat-nosed, bulging-lipped faces. They were, he declared later in
   his manuscript, the most terrible objective entities he ever saw in his
   life, either in K'n-yan or in the outer world. And the specific quality of
   their supreme terror was something apart from any easily recognisable or
   describable feature. The main trouble was that they were not wholly
   products of Nature.

   The party observed Zamacona's fright, and hastened to reassure him as much
   as possible. The beasts or gyaa-yothn, they explained, surely were curious
   things; but were really very harmless. The flesh they ate was not that of
   intelligent people of the master-race, but merely that of a special
   slave-class which had for the most part ceased to be thoroughly human, and
   which indeed was the principal meat stock of K'n-yan. They-or their
   principal ancestral element-had first been found in a wild state amidst
   the Cyclopean ruins of the deserted red-litten world of Yoth which lay
   below the blue-litten world of K'n-yan. That part of them was human,
   seemed quite clear; but men of science could never decide whether they
   were actually the descendants of the bygone entities who had lived and
   reigned in the strange ruins. The chief ground for such a supposition was
   the well-known fact that the vanished inhabitants of Yoth had been
   quadrupedal. This much was known from the very few manuscripts and
   carvings found in the vaults of Zin, beneath the largest ruined city of
   Yoth. But it was also known from these manuscripts that the beings of Yoth
   had possessed the art of synthetically creating life, and had made and
   destroyed several efficiently designed races of industrial and
   transportational animals in the course of their history-to say nothing of
   concocting all manner of fantastic living shapes for the sake of amusement
   and new sensations during the long period of decadence. The beings of Yoth
   had undoubtedly been reptilian in affiliations, and most physiologists of
   Tsath agreed that the present beasts had been very much inclined toward
   reptilianism before they had been crossed with the mammal slave-class of
   K'n-yan.

   It argues well for the intrepid fire of those Renaissance Spaniards who
   conquered half the unknown world, that Panfilo de Zamacona y Nunez
   actually mounted one of the morbid beasts of Tsath and fell into place
   beside the leader of the cavalcade-the man named Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn, who had
   been most active in the previous exchange of information. It was a
   repulsive business; but after all, the seat was very easy, and the gait of
   the clumsy gyaa-yoth surprisingly even and regular. No saddle was
   necessary, and the animal appeared to require no guidance whatever. The
   procession moved forward at a brisk gait, stopping only at certain
   abandoned cities and temples about which Zamacona was curious, and which
   Gll'Hthaa-Ynn was obligingly ready to display and explain. The largest of
   these towns, B'graa, was a marvel of finely wrought gold, and Zamacona
   studied the curiously ornate architecture with avid interest. Buildings
   tended toward height and slenderness, with roofs bursting into a multitude
   of pinnacles. The streets were narrow, curving, and occasionally
   picturesquely hilly, but Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn said that the later cities of
   K'n-yan were far more spacious and regular in design. All these old cities
   of the plain shewed traces of levelled walls-reminders of the archaic days
   when they had been successively conquered by the now dispersed armies of
   Tsath.

   There was one object along the route which Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn exhibited on his
   own initiative, even though it involved a detour of about a mile along a
   vine-tangled side path. This was a squat, plain temple of black basalt
   blocks without a single carving, and containing only a vacant onyx
   pedestal. The remarkable thing about it was its story, for it was a link
   with a fabled elder world compared to which even cryptic Yoth was a thing
   of yesterday. It had been built in imitation of certain temples depicted
   in the vaults of Zin, to house a very terrible black toad-idol found in
   the red-litten world and called Tsathoggua in the Yothic manuscripts. It
   had been a potent and widely worshipped god, and after its adoption by the
   people of K'n-yan had lent its name to the city which was later to become
   dominant in that region. Yothic legend said that it had come from a
   mysterious inner realm beneath the red-litten world-a black realm of
   peculiar-sensed beings which had no light at all, but which had had great
   civilisations and mighty gods before ever the reptilian quadrupeds of Yoth
   had come into being. Many images of Tsathoggua existed in Yoth, all of
   which were alleged to have come from the black inner realm, and which were
   supposed by Yothic archaeologists to represent the aeon-extinct race of
   that realm. The black realm called N'kai in the Yothic manuscripts had
   been explored as thoroughly as possible by these archaeologists, and
   singular stone troughs or burrows had excited infinite speculation.

   When the men of K'n-yan discovered the red-litten world and deciphered its
   strange manuscripts, they took over the Tsathoggua cult and brought all
   the frightful toad images up to the land of blue light-housing them in
   shrines of Yoth-quarried basalt like the one Zamacona now saw. The cult
   flourished until it almost rivalled the ancient cults of Yig and Tulu, and
   one branch of the race even took it to the outer world, where the smallest
   of the images eventually found a shrine at Olathoe, in the land of Lomar
   near the earth's north pole. It was rumoured that this outer-world cult
   survived even after the great ice-sheet and the hairy Gnophkehs destroyed
   Lomar, but of such matters not much was definitely known in K'n-yan.. In
   that world of blue light the cult came to an abrupt end, even though the
   name of Tsath was suffered to remain.

   What ended the cult was the partial exploration of the black realm of
   N'kai beneath the red-litten world of Yoth. According to the Yothic
   manuscripts, there was no surviving life in N'kai, but something must have
   happened in the aeons between the days of Yoth and the coming of men to
   the earth; something perhaps not unconnected with the end of Yoth.
   Probably it had been an earthquake, opening up lower chambers of the
   lightless world which had been closed against the Yothic archaeologists;
   or perhaps some more frightful juxtaposition of energy and electrons,
   wholly inconceivable to any sort of vertebrate minds, had taken place. At
   any rate, when the men of K'n-yan went down into N'kai's black abyss with
   their great atom-power searchlights they found living things-living things
   that oozed along stone channels and worshipped onyx and basalt images of
   Tsathoggua. But they were not toads like Tsathoggua himself. Far
   worse-they were amorphous lumps of viscous black slime that took temporary
   shapes for various purposes. The explorers of K'n-yan did not pause for
   detailed observations, and those who escaped alive sealed the passage
   leading from red-litten Yoth down into the gulfs of nether horror. Then
   all the images of Tsathoggua in the land of K'n-yan were dissolved into
   the ether by disintegrating rays, and the cult was abolished forever.

   Aeons later, when naive fears were outgrown and supplanted by scientific
   curiosity, the old legends of Tsathoggua and N'kai were recalled and a
   suitably armed and equipped exploring party went down to Yoth to find the
   closed gate of the black abyss and see what might still lie beneath. But
   they could not find the gate, nor could any man ever do so in all the ages
   that followed. Nowadays there were those who doubted that any abyss had
   ever existed, but the few scholars who could still decipher the Yothic
   manuscripts believed that the evidence for such a thing was adequate, even
   though the middle records of K'n-yan, with accounts of the one frightful
   expedition into N'kai, were more open to question. Some of the later
   religious cults tried to suppress remembrance of N'kai's existence, and
   attached severe penalties to its mention; but these had not begun to be
   taken seriously at the time of Zamacona's advent to K'n-yan.

   As the cavalcade returned to the old highway and approached the low range
   of mountains, Zamacona saw that the river was very close on the left.
   Somewhat later, as the terrain rose, the stream entered a gorge and passed
   through the hills, while the road traversed the gap at a rather higher
   level close to the brink. It was about this time that light rainfall came.
   Zamacona noticed the occasional drops and drizzle, and looked up at the
   coruscating blue air, but there was no diminution of the strange radiance.
   Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn then told him that such condensations and precipitations of
   water-vapour were not uncommon, and that they never dimmed the glare of
   the vault above. A kind of mist, indeed, always hung about the lowlands of
   K'n-yan, and compensated for the complete absence of true clouds.

   The slight rise of the mountain pass enabled Zamacona, by looking behind,
   to see the ancient and deserted plain in panorama as he had seen it from
   the other side. He seems to have appreciated its strange beauty, and to
   have vaguely regretted leaving it; for he speaks of being urged by
   Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn to drive his beast more rapidly. When he faced frontward
   again he saw that the crest of the road was very near; the weed-grown way
   leading starkly up and ending against a blank void of blue light. The
   scene was undoubtedly highly impressive-a steep green mountain wall on the
   right, a deep river-chasm on the left with another green mountain wall
   beyond it, and ahead, the churning sea of bluish coruscations into which
   the upward path dissolved. Then came the crest itself, and with it the
   world of Tsath outspread in a stupendous forward vista.

   Zamacona caught his breath at the great sweep of peopled landscape, for it
   was a hive of settlement and activity beyond anything he had ever seen or
   dreamed of. The downward slope of the hill itself was relatively thinly
   strown with small farms and occasional temples; but beyond it lay an
   enormous plain covered like a chess board with planted trees, irrigated by
   narrow canals cut from the river, and threaded by wide, geometrically
   precise roads of gold or basalt blocks. Great silver cables borne aloft on
   golden pillars linked the low, spreading buildings and clusters of
   buildings which rose here and there, and in some places one could see
   lines of partly ruinous pillars without cables. Moving objects skewed the
   fields to be under tillage, and in some cases Zamacona saw that men were
   ploughing with the aid of the repulsive, half-human quadrupeds.

   But most impressive of all was the bewildering vision of clustered spires
   and pinnacles which rose afar off across the plain and shimmered
   flower-like and spectral in the coruscating blue light. At first Zamacona
   thought it was a mountain covered with houses and temples, like some of
   the picturesque hill cities of his own Spain, but a second glance shewed
   him that it was not indeed such. It was a city of the plain, but fashioned
   of such heaven-reaching towers that its outline was truly that of a
   mountain. Above it hung a curious greyish haze, through which the blue
   light glistened and took added overtones of radiance from the million
   golden minarets. Glancing at Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn, Zamacona knew that this was
   the monstrous, gigantic, and omnipotent city of Tsath.

   As the road turned downward toward the plain, Zamacona felt a kind of
   uneasiness and sense of evil. He did not like the beast he rode, or the
   world that could provide such a beast, and he did not like the atmosphere
   that brooded over the distant city of Tsath. When the cavalcade began to
   pass occasional farms, the Spaniard noticed the forms that worked in the
   fields; and did not like their motions and proportions, or the mutilations
   he saw on most of them. Moreover, he did not like the way that some of
   these forms were herded in corrals, or the way they grazed on the heavy
   verdure. Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn indicated that these beings were members of the
   slave-class, and that their acts were controlled by the master of the
   farm, who gave them hypnotic impressions in the morning of all they were
   to do during the day. As semi-conscious machines, their industrial
   efficiency was nearly perfect. Those in the corrals were inferior
   specimens, classified merely as livestock.

   Upon reaching the plain, Zamacona saw the larger farms and noted the
   almost human work performed by the repulsive horned gyaa-yothn. He
   likewise observed the more manlike shapes that toiled along the furrows,
   and felt a curious fright and disgust toward certain of them whose motions
   were more mechanical than those of the rest. These, Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn
   explained, were what men called the y'm-bhi-organisms which had died, but
   which had been mechanically reanimated for industrial purposes by means of
   atomic energy and thought-power. The slave-class did not share the
   immortality of the freemen of Tsath, so that with time the number of
   yDEGm-bhi had become very large. They were dog-like and faithful, but not
   so readily amenable to thought-commands as were living slaves. Those which
   most repelled Zamacona were those whose mutilations were greatest; for
   some were wholly headless, while others had suffered singular and
   seemingly capricious subtractions, distortions, transpositions, and
   graftings in various places. The Spaniard could not account for this
   condition, but Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn made it clear that these were slaves who had
   been used for the amusement of the people in some of the vast arenas; for
   the men of Tsath were connoisseurs of delicate sensation, and required a
   constant supply of fresh and novel stimuli for their jaded impulses.
   Zamacona, though by no means squeamish, was not favourably impressed by
   what he saw and heard.

   Approached more closely, the vast metropolis became dimly horrible in its
   monstrous extent and inhuman height. Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn explained that the
   upper parts of the great towers were no longer used, and that many had
   been taken down to avoid the bother of maintenance. The plain around the
   original urban area was covered with newer and smaller dwellings, which in
   many cases were preferred to the ancient towers. From the whole mass of
   gold and stone a monotonous roar of activity droned outward over the
   plain, while cavalcades and streams of wagons were constantly entering and
   leaving over the great gold- or stone-paved roads.

   Several times Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn paused to shew Zamacona some particular
   object of interest, especially the temples of Yig, Tulu, Nug, Yeb, and the
   Not-to-Be-Named One which lined the road at infrequent intervals, each in
   its embowering grove according to the custom of K'n-yan. These temples,
   unlike those of the deserted plain beyond the mountains, were still in
   active use; large parties of mounted worshippers coming and going in
   constant streams. Gll'Hthaa-Ynn took Zamacona into each of them, and the
   Spaniard watched the subtle orgiastic rites with fascination and
   repulsion. The ceremonies of Nug and Yeb sickened him especially-so much,
   indeed, that he refrained from describing them in his manuscript. One
   squat, black temple of Tsathoggua was encountered, but it had been turned
   into a shrine of Shub-Niggurath, the All-Mother and wife of the
   Not-to-Be-Named One. This deity was a kind of sophisticated Astarte, and
   her worship struck the pious Catholic as supremely obnoxious. What he
   liked least of all were the emotional sounds emitted by the
   celebrants-jarring sounds in a race that had ceased to use vocal speech
   for ordinary purposes.

   Close to the compact outskirts of Tsath, and well within the shadow of its
   terrifying towers, Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn pointed out a monstrous circular
   building before which enormous crowds were lined up. This, he indicated,
   was one of the many amphitheatres where curious sports and sensations were
   provided for the weary people of K'n-yan. He was about to pause and usher
   Zamacona inside the vast curved facade, when the Spaniard, recalling the
   mutilated forms he had seen in the fields, violently demurred. This was
   the first of those friendly clashes of taste which were to convince the
   people of Tsath that their guest followed strange and narrow standards.

   Tsath itself was a network of strange and ancient streets; and despite a
   growing sense of horror and alienage, Zamacona was enthralled by its
   intimations of mystery and cosmic wonder. The dizzy giganticism of its
   overawing towers, the monstrous surge of teeming life through its ornate
   avenues, the curious carvings on its doorways and windows, the odd vistas
   glimpsed from balustraded plazas and tiers of titan terraces, and the
   enveloping grey haze which seemed to press down on the gorge-like streets
   in low ceiling-fashion, all combined to produce such a sense of
   adventurous expectancy as he had never known before. He was taken at once
   to a council of executives which held forth in a gold-and-copper palace
   behind a gardened and fountained park, and was for some time subjected to
   close, friendly questioning in a vaulted hall frescoed with vertiginous
   arabesques. Much was expected of him, he could see, in the way of
   historical information about the outside earth; but in return all the
   mysteries of K'n-yan would be unveiled to him. The one great drawback was
   the inexorable ruling that he might never return to the world of sun and
   stars and Spain which was his.

   A daily programme was laid down for the visitor, with time apportioned
   judiciously among several kinds of activities. There were to be
   conversations with persons of learning in various places, and lessons in
   many branches of Tsathic lore. Liberal periods of research were allowed
   for, and all the libraries of K'n-yan both secular and sacred were to be
   thrown open to him as soon as he might master the written languages. Rites
   and spectacles were to be attended-except when he might especially
   object-and much time would be left for the enlightened pleasure-seeking
   and emotional titillation which formed the goal and nucleus of daily life.
   A house in the suburbs or an apartment in the city would be assigned him,
   and he would be initiated into one of the large affection-groups,
   including many noblewomen of the most extreme and art-enhanced beauty,
   which in latter-day K'n-yan took the place of family units. Several horned
   gyaa-yothn would be provided for his transportation and errand-running,
   and ten living slaves of intact body would serve to conduct his
   establishment and protect him from thieves and sadists and religious
   orgiasts on the public highways. There were many mechanical devices which
   he must learn to use, but Gll'-Hthaa-Ynn would instruct him immediately
   regarding the principal ones.

   Upon his choosing an apartment in preference to a suburban villa, Zamacona
   was dismissed by the executives with great courtesy and ceremony, and was
   led through several gorgeous streets to a cliff-like carven structure of
   some seventy or eighty floors. Preparations for his arrival had already
   been instituted, and in a spacious ground-floor suite of vaulted rooms
   slaves were busy adjusting hangings and furniture. There were lacquered
   and inlaid tabourets, velvet and silk reclining-corners and
   squatting-cushions, and infinite rows of teakwood and ebony pigeon-holes
   with metal cylinders containing some of the manuscripts he was soon to
   read-standard classics which all urban apartments possessed. Desks with
   great stacks of membrane-paper and pots of the prevailing green pigment
   were in every room-each with graded sets of pigment brushes and other odd
   bits of stationery. Mechanical writing devices stood on ornate golden
   tripods, while over all was shed a brilliant blue light from energy-globes
   set in the ceiling. There were windows, but at this shadowy ground-level
   they were of scant illuminating value. In some of the rooms were elaborate
   baths, while the kitchen was a maze of technical contrivances. Supplies
   were brought, Zamacona was told, through the network of underground
   passages which lay beneath Tsath, and which had once accommodated curious
   mechanical transports. There was a stable on that underground level for
   the beasts, and Zamacona would presently be shewn how to find the nearest
   runway to the street. Before his inspection was finished, the permanent
   staff of slaves arrived and were introduced; and shortly afterward there
   came some halfdozen freemen and noblewomen of his future affection-group,
   who were to be his companions for several days, contributing what they
   could to his instruction and amusement. Upon their departure, another
   party would take their place, and so onward in rotation through a group of
   about fifty members.

                                      VI.

   Thus was Panfilo de Zamacona y Nunez absorbed for four years into the life
   of the sinister city of Tsath in the blue-litten nether world of K'n-yan.
   All that he learned and saw and did is clearly not told in his manuscript;
   for a pious reticence overcame him when he began to write in his native
   Spanish tongue, and he dared not set down everything. Much he consistently
   viewed with repulsion, and many things he steadfastly refrained from
   seeing or doing or eating. For other things he atoned by frequent
   countings of the beads of his rosary. He explored the entire world of
   K'n-yan, including the deserted machine-cities of the middle period on the
   gorse-grown plain of Nith, and made one descent into the red-litten world
   of Yoth to see the Cyclopean ruins. He witnessed prodigies of craft and
   machinery which left him breathless, and beheld human metamorphoses,
   dematerialisations, rematerialisations, and reanimations which made him
   cross himself again and again. His very capacity for astonishment was
   blunted by the plethora of new marvels which every day brought him.

   But the longer he stayed, the more he wished to leave, for the inner life
   of K'n-yan was based on impulses very plainly outside his radius. As he
   progressed in historical knowledge, he understood more; but understanding
   only heightened his distaste. He felt that the people of Tsath were a lost
   and dangerous race-more dangerous to themselves than they knew-and that
   their growing frenzy of monotony-warfare and novelty-quest was leading
   them rapidly toward a precipice of disintegration and utter horror. His
   own visit, he could see, had accelerated their unrest; not only by
   introducing fears of outside invasion, but by exciting in many a wish to
   sally forth and taste the diverse external world he described. As time
   progressed, he noticed an increasing tendency of the people to resort to
   dematerialisation as an amusement; so that the apartments and
   amphitheatres of Tsath became a veritable Witches' Sabbath of
   transmutations, age-adjustments, death-experiments, and projections. With
   the growth of boredom and restlessness, he saw, cruelty and subtlety and
   revolt were growing apace. There was more and more cosmic abnormality,
   more and more curious sadism, more and more ignorance and superstition,
   and more and more desire to escape out of physical life into a
   half-spectral state of electronic dispersal.

   All his efforts to leave, however, came to nothing. Persuasion was
   useless, as repeated trials proved; though the mature disillusion of the
   upper classes at first prevented them from resenting their guest's open
   wish for departure. In a year which he reckoned as 1543 Zamacona made an
   actual attempt to escape through the tunnel by which he had entered
   K'n-yan, but after a weary journey across the deserted plain he
   encountered forces in the dark passage which discouraged him from future
   attempts in that direction. As a means of sustaining hope and keeping the
   image of home in mind, he began about this time to make rough draughts of
   the manuscript relating his adventures; delighting in the loved, old
   Spanish words and the familiar letters of the Roman alphabet. Somehow he
   fancied he might get the manuscript to the outer world; and to make it
   convincing to his fellows he resolved to enclose it in one of the
   Tulu-metal cylinders used for sacred archives. That alien, magnetic
   substance could not but support the incredible story he had to tell.

   But even as he planned, he had little real hope of ever establishing
   contact with the earth's surface. Every known gate, he knew, was guarded
   by persons or forces that it were better not to oppose. His attempt at
   escape had not helped matters, for he could now see a growing hostility to
   the outer world he represented. He hoped that no other European would find
   his way in; for it was possible that later comers might not fare as well
   as he. He himself had been a cherished fountain of data, and as such had
   enjoyed a privileged status. Others, deemed less necessary, might receive
   rather different treatment. He even wondered what would happen to him when
   the sages of Tsath considered him drained dry of fresh facts; and in
   self-defence began to be more gradual in his talks on earth-lore,
   conveying whenever he could the impression of vast knowledge held in
   reserve.

   One other thing which endangered Zamacona's status in Tsath was his
   persistent curiosity regarding the ultimate abyss of N'kai, beneath
   red-litten Yoth, whose existence the dominant religious cults of K'n-yan
   were more and more inclined to deny. When exploring Yoth he had vainly
   tried to find the blocked-up entrance; and later on he experimented in the
   arts of dematerialisation and projection, hoping that he might thereby be
   able to throw his consciousness downward into the gulfs which his physical
   eyes could not discover. Though never becoming truly proficient in these
   processes, he did manage to achieve a series of monstrous and portentous
   dreams which he believed included some elements of actual projection into
   N'kai; dreams which greatly shocked and perturbed the leaders of Yig and
   Tulu-worship when he related them, and which he was advised by friends to
   conceal rather than exploit. In time those dreams became very frequent and
   maddening; containing things which he dared not record in his main
   manuscript, but of which he prepared a special record for the benefit of
   certain learned men in Tsath.

   It may have been unfortunate-or it may have been mercifully fortunate-that
   Zamacona practiced so many reticences and reserved so many themes and
   descriptions for subsidiary manuscripts. The main document leaves one to
   guess much about the detailed manners, customs, thoughts, language, and
   history of K'n-yan, as well as to form any adequate picture of the visual
   aspect and daily life of Tsath. One is left puzzled, too, about the real
   motivations of the people; their strange passivity and craven
   unwarlikeness, and their almost cringing fear of the outer world despite
   their possession of atomic and dematerialising powers which would have
   made them unconquerable had they taken the trouble to organise armies as
   in the old days. It is evident that K'n-yan was far along in its
   decadence-reacting with mixed apathy and hysteria against the standardised
   and time-tabled life of stultifying regularity which machinery had brought
   it during its middle period. Even the grotesque and repulsive customs and
   modes of thought and feeling can be traced to this source; for in his
   historical research Zamacona found evidence of bygone eras in which
   K'n-yan had held ideas much like those of the classic and renaissance
   outer world, and had possessed a national character and art full of what
   Europeans regard as dignity, kindness, and nobility.

   The more Zamacona studied these things, the more apprehensive about the
   future he became; because he saw that the omnipresent moral and
   intellectual disintegration was a tremendously deep-seated and ominously
   accelerating movement. Even during his stay the signs of decay multiplied.
   Rationalism degenerated more and more into fanatical and orgiastic
   superstition, centring in a lavish adoration of the magnetic Tulu-metal,
   and tolerance steadily dissolved into a series of frenzied hatreds,
   especially toward the outer world of which the scholars were learning so
   much from him. At times he almost feared that the people might some day
   lose their age-long apathy and brokenness and turn like desperate rats
   against the unknown lands above them, sweeping all before them by virtue
   of their singular and still-remembered scientific powers. But for the
   present they fought their boredom and sense of emptiness in other ways;
   multiplying their hideous emotional outlets and increasing the mad
   grotesqueness and abnormality of their diversions. The arenas of Tsath
   must have been accursed and unthinkable places-Zamacona never went near
   them. And what they would be in another century, or even in another
   decade, he did not dare to think. The pious Spaniard crossed himself and
   counted his beads more often than usual in those days.

   In the year 1545, as he reckoned it, Zamacona began what may well be
   accepted as his final series of attempts to leave K'n-yan. His fresh
   opportunity came from an unexpected source-a female of his affection-group
   who conceived for him a curious individual infatuation based on some
   hereditary memory of the days of monogamous wedlock in Tsath. Over this
   female-a noblewoman of moderate beauty and of at least average
   intelligence named T'la-yub-Zamacona acquired the most extraordinary
   influence; finally inducing her to help him in an escape, under the
   promise that he would let her accompany him. Chance proved a great factor
   in the course of events, for T'la-yub came of a primordial family of
   gatelords who had retained oral traditions of at least one passage to the
   outer world which the mass of people had forgotten even at the time of the
   great closing; a passage to a mound on the level plains of earth which
   had, in consequence, never been sealed up or guarded. She explained that
   the primordial gate-lords were not guards or sentries, but merely
   ceremonial and economic proprietors, half-feudal and baronial in status,
   of an era preceding the severance of surface-relations. Her own family had
   been so reduced at the time of the closing that their gate had been wholly
   overlooked; and they had ever afterward preserved the secret of its
   existence as a sort of hereditary secret-a source of pride, and of a sense
   of reserve power, to offset the feeling of vanished wealth and influence
   which so constantly irritated them.

   Zamacona, now working feverishly to get his manuscript into final form in
   case anything should happen to him, decided to take with him on his
   outward journey only five beast-loads of unalloyed gold in the form of the
   small ingots used for minor decorations-enough, he calculated, to make him
   a personage of unlimited power in his own world. He had become somewhat
   hardened to the sight of the monstrous gyaa-yothn during his four years of
   residence in Tsath, hence did not shrink from using the creatures; yet he
   resolved to kill and bury them, and cache the gold, as soon as he reached
   the outer world, since he knew that even a glimpse of one of the things
   would drive any ordinary Indian mad. Later he could arrange for a suitable
   expedition to transport the treasure to Mexico. T'la-yub he would perhaps
   allow to share his fortunes, for she was by no means unattractive; though
   possibly he would arrange for her sojourn amongst the plains Indians,
   since he was not overanxious to preserve links with the manner of life in
   Tsath. For a wife, of course, he would choose a lady of Spain-or at worst,
   an Indian princess of normal outer-world descent and a regular and
   approved past. But for the present T'la-yub must be used as a guide. The
   manuscript he would carry on his own person, encased in a book-cylinder of
   the sacred and magnetic Tulu-metal.

   The expedition itself is described in the addendum to Zamacona's
   manuscript, written later, and in a hand shewing signs of nervous strain.
   It set out amidst the most careful precautions, choosing a rest-period and
   proceeding as far as possible along the faintly lighted passages beneath
   the city. Zamacona and T'la-yub, disguised in slaves' garments, bearing
   provision-knapsacks, and leading the five laden beasts on foot, were
   readily taken for commonplace workers; and they clung as long as possible
   to the subterranean way-using a long and little-frequented branch which
   had formerly conducted the mechanical transports to the now ruined suburb
   of L'thaa. Amidst the ruins of L'thaa they came to the surface, thereafter
   passing as rapidly as possible over the deserted, blue-litten plain of
   Nith toward the Grh-yan range of low hills. There, amidst the tangled
   underbrush, T'la-yub found the long disused and half-fabulous entrance to
   the forgotten tunnel; a thing she had seen but once before-aeons in the
   past, when her father had taken her thither to shew her this monument to
   their family pride. It was hard work getting the laden gyaa-yothn to
   scrape through the obstructing vines and briers, and one of them displayed
   a rebelliousness destined to bear dire consequences-bolting away from the
   party and loping back toward Tsath on its detestable pads, golden burden
   and all.

   It was nightmare work burrowing by the light of blue-ray torches upward,
   downward, forward, and upward again through a dank, choked tunnel that no
   foot had trodden since ages before the sinking of Atlantis; and at one
   point T'la-yub had to practice the fearsome art of dematerialisation on
   herself, Zamacona, and the laden beasts in order to pass a point wholly
   clogged by shifting earth-strata. It was a terrible experience for
   Zamacona; for although he had often witnessed dematerialisation in others,
   and even practiced it himself to the extent of dream-projection, he had
   never been fully subjected to it before. But T'la-yub was skilled in the
   arts of K'n-yan, and accomplished the double metamorphosis in perfect
   safety.

   Thereafter they resumed the hideous burrowing through stalactited crypts
   of horror where monstrous carvings leered at every turn; alternately
   camping and advancing for a period which Zamacona reckoned as about three
   days, but which was probably less. At last they came to a very narrow
   place where the natural or only slightly hewn cave-walls gave place to
   walls of wholly artificial masonry, carved into terrible bas-reliefs.
   These walls, after about a mile of steep ascent, ended with a pair of vast
   niches, one on each side, in which monstrous, nitre-encrusted images of
   Yig and Tulu squatted, glaring at each other across the passage as they
   had glared since the earliest youth of the human world. At this point the
   passage opened into a prodigious vaulted and circular chamber of human
   construction; wholly covered with horrible carvings, and revealing at the
   farther end an arched passageway with the foot of a flight of steps.
   T'la-yub knew from family tales that this must be very near the earth's
   surface, but she could not tell just how near. Here the party camped for
   what they meant to be their last rest-period in the subterraneous world.

   It must have been hours later that the clank of metal and the padding of
   beasts' feet awakened Zamacona and T'la-yub. A bluish glare was spreading
   from the narrow passage between the images of Yig and Tulu, and in an
   instant the truth was obvious. An alarm had been given at Tsath-as was
   later revealed, by the returning gyaa-yoth which had rebelled at the
   brier-choked tunnel-entrance-and a swift party of pursuers had come to
   arrest the fugitives. Resistance was clearly useless, and none was
   offered. The party of twelve beast-riders proved studiously polite, and
   the return commenced almost without a word or thought-message on either
   side.

   It was an ominous and depressing journey, and the ordeal of
   dematerialisation and rematerialisation at the choked place was all the
   more terrible because of the lack of that hope and expectancy which had
   palliated the process on the outward trip. Zamacona heard his captors
   discussing the imminent clearing of this choked place by intensive
   radiations, since henceforward sentries must be maintained at the hitherto
   unknown outer portal. It would not do to let outsiders get within the
   passage, for then any who might escape without due treatment would have a
   hint of the vastness of the inner world and would perhaps be curious
   enough to return in greater strength. As with the other passages since
   Zamacona's coming, sentries must be stationed all along, as far as the
   very outermost gate; sentries drawn from amongst all the slaves, the
   dead-alive y'm-bhi, or the class of discredited freemen. With the
   overrunning of the American plains by thousands of Europeans, as the
   Spaniard had predicted, every passage was a potential source of danger;
   and must be rigorously guarded until the technologists of Tsath could
   spare the energy to prepare an ultimate and entrance-hiding obliteration
   as they had done for many passages in earlier and more vigorous times.

   Zamacona and T'la-yub were tried before three gn'agn of the supreme
   tribunal in the gold-and-copper palace behind the gardened and fountained
   park, and the Spaniard was given his liberty because of the vital
   outer-world information he still had to impart. He was told to return to
   his apartment and to his affection-group; taking up his life as before,
   and continuing to meet deputations of scholars according to the latest
   schedule he had been following. No restrictions would be imposed upon him
   so long as he might remain peacefully in K'n-yan-but it was intimated that
   such leniency would not be repeated after another attempt at escape.
   Zamacona had felt that there was an element of irony in the parting words
   of the chief gn'ag-an assurance that all of his gyaa-yothn, including the
   one which had rebelled, would be returned to him.

   The fate of T'la-yub was less happy. There being no object in retaining
   her, and her ancient Tsathic lineage giving her act a greater aspect of
   treason than Zamacona's had possessed, she was ordered to be delivered to
   the curious diversions of the amphitheatre; and afterward, in a somewhat
   mutilated and half-dematerialised form, to be given the functions of a
   y'm-bhi or animated corpse-slave and stationed among the sentries guarding
   the passage whose existence she had betrayed. Zamacona soon heard, not
   without many pangs of regret he could scarcely have anticipated, that poor
   T'la-yub had emerged from the arena in a headless and otherwise incomplete
   state, and had been set as an outermost guard upon the mound in which the
   passage had been found to terminate. She was, he was told, a
   night-sentinel, whose automatic duty was to warn off all comers with a
   torch; sending down reports to a small garrison of twelve dead slave
   y'm-bhi and six living but partly dematerialised freemen in the vaulted,
   circular chamber if the approachers did not heed her warning. She worked,
   he was told, in conjunction with a day-sentinel-a living freeman who chose
   this post in preference to other forms of discipline for other offences
   against the state. Zamacona, of course, had long known that most of the
   chief gate-sentries were such discredited freemen.

   It was now made plain to him, though indirectly, that his own penalty for
   another escape-attempt would be service as a gate-sentry-but in the form
   of a dead-alive y'm-bhi slave, and after amphitheatre-treatment even more
   picturesque than that which T'la-yub was reported to have undergone. It
   was intimated that he-or parts of him-would be reanimated to guard some
   inner section of the passage; within sight of others, where his abridged
   person might serve as a permanent symbol of the rewards of treason. But,
   his informants always added, it was of course inconceivable that he would
   ever court such a fate. So long as he remained peaceably in K'n-yan, he
   would continue to be a free, privileged, and respected personage.

   Yet in the end Panfilo de Zamacona did court the fate so direfully hinted
   to him. True, he did not really expect to encounter it; but the nervous
   latter part of his manuscript makes it clear that he was prepared to face
   its possibility. What gave him a final hope of scatheless escape from
   K'n-yan was his growing mastery of the art of dematerialisation. Having
   studied it for years, and having learned still more from the two instances
   in which he had been subjected to it, he now felt increasingly able to use
   it independently and effectively. The manuscript records several notable
   experiments in this art-minor successes accomplished in his apartment-and
   reflects Zamacona's hope that he might soon be able to assume the spectral
   form in full, attaining complete invisibility and preserving that
   condition as long as he wished.

   Once he reached this stage, he argued, the outward way lay open to him. Of
   course he could not bear away any gold, but mere escape was enough. He
   would, though, dematerialise and carry away with him his manuscript in the
   Tulu-metal cylinder, even though it cost additional effort; for this
   record and proof must reach the outer world at all hazards. He now knew
   the passage to follow; and if he could thread it in an atom-scattered
   state, he did not see how any person or force could detect or stop him.
   The only trouble would be if he failed to maintain his spectral condition
   at all times. That was the one ever-present peril, as he had learned from
   his experiments. But must one not always risk death and worse in a life of
   adventure? Zamacona was a gentleman of Old Spain; of the blood that faced
   the unknown and carved out half the civilisation of the New World.

   For many nights after his ultimate resolution Zamacona prayed to St.
   Pamphilus and other guardian saints, and counted the beads of his rosary.
   The last entry in the manuscript, which toward the end took the form of a
   diary more and more, was merely a single sentence-"Es mas tarde de lo que
   pensaba-tengo que marcharme".... "It is later than I thought; I must go."
   After that, only silence and conjecture-and such evidence as the presence
   of the manuscript itself, and what that manuscript could lead to, might
   provide.

                                      VII.

   When I looked up from my half-stupefied reading and notetaking the morning
   sun was high in the heavens. The electric bulb was still burning, but such
   things of the real world-the modern outer world-were far from my whirling
   brain. I knew I was in my room at Clyde Compton's at Binger-but upon what
   monstrous vista had I stumbled? Was this thing a hoax or a chronicle of
   madness? If a hoax, was it a jest of the sixteenth century or of today?
   The manuscript's age looked appallingly genuine to my not wholly
   unpracticed eyes, and the problem presented by the strange metal cylinder
   I dared not even think about.

   Moreover, what a monstrously exact explanation it gave of all the baffling
   phenomena of the mound-of the seemingly meaningless and paradoxical
   actions of diurnal and nocturnal ghosts, and of the queer cases of madness
   and disappearance! It was even an accursedly plausible explanation-evilly
   consistent-if one could adopt the incredible. It must be a shocking hoax
   devised by someone who knew all the lore of the mound. There was even a
   hint of social satire in the account of that unbelievable nether world of
   horror and decay. Surely this was the clever forgery of some learned
   cynic-something like the leaden crosses in New Mexico, which a jester once
   planted and pretended to discover as a relique of some forgotten Dark Age
   colony from Europe.

   Upon going down to breakfast I hardly knew what to tell Compton and his
   mother, as well as the curious callers who had already begun to arrive.
   Still in a daze, I cut the Gordian Knot by giving a few points from the
   notes I had made, and mumbling my belief that the thing was a subtle and
   ingenious fraud left there by some previous explorer of the mound-a belief
   in which everybody seemed to concur when told of the substance of the
   manuscript. It is curious how all that breakfast group-and all the others
   in Binger to whom the discussion was repeated-seemed to find a great
   clearing of the atmosphere in the notion that somebody was playing a joke
   on somebody. For the time we all forgot that the known, recent history of
   the mound presented mysteries as strange as any in the manuscript, and as
   far from acceptable solution as ever.

   The fears and doubts began to return when I asked for volunteers to visit
   the mound with me. I wanted a larger excavating party-but the idea of
   going to that uncomfortable place seemed no more attractive to the people
   of Binger than it had seemed on the previous day. I myself felt a mounting
   horror upon looking toward the mound and glimpsing the moving speck which
   I knew was the daylight sentinel; for in spite of all my scepticism the
   morbidities of that manuscript stuck by me and gave everything connected
   with the place a new and monstrous significance. I absolutely lacked the
   resolution to look at the moving speck with my binoculars. Instead, I set
   out with the kind of bravado we display in nightmares-when, knowing we are
   dreaming, we plunge desperately into still thicker horrors, for the sake
   of having the whole thing over the sooner. My pick and shovel were already
   out there, so I had only my handbag of smaller paraphernalia to take. Into
   this I put the strange cylinder and its contents, feeling vaguely that I
   might possibly find something worth checking up with some part of the
   green-lettered Spanish text. Even a clever hoax might be founded on some
   actual attribute of the mound which a former explorer had discovered-and
   that magnetic metal was damnably odd! Grey Eagle's cryptic talisman still
   hung from its leathern cord around my neck.

   I did not look very sharply at the mound as I walked toward it, but when I
   reached it there was nobody in sight. Repeating my upward scramble of the
   previous day, I was troubled by thoughts of what might lie close at hand
   if, by any miracle, any part of the manuscript were actually half-true. In
   such a case, I could not help reflecting, the hypothetical Spaniard
   Zamacona must have barely reached the outer world when overtaken by some
   disaster-perhaps an involuntary rematerialisation. He would naturally, in
   that event, have been seized by whichever sentry happened to be on duty at
   the time-either the discredited freeman, or, as a matter of supreme irony,
   the very T'la-yub who had planned and aided his first attempt at
   escape-and in the ensuing struggle the cylinder with the manuscript might
   well have been dropped on the mound's summit, to be neglected and
   gradually buried for nearly four centuries. But, I added, as I climbed
   over the crest, one must not think of extravagant things like that. Still,
   if there were anything in the tale, it must have been a monstrous fate to
   which Zamacona had been dragged back ... the amphitheatre ... mutilation
   ... duty somewhere in the dank, nitrous tunnel as a dead-alive slave ... a
   maimed corpse-fragment as an automatic interior sentry....

   It was a very real shock which chased this morbid speculation from my
   head, for upon glancing around the elliptical summit I saw at once that my
   pick and shovel had been stolen. This was a highly provoking and
   disconcerting development; baffling, too, in view of the seeming
   reluctance of all the Binger folk to visit the mound. Was this reluctance
   a pretended thing, and had the jokers of the village been chuckling over
   my coming discomfiture as they solemnly saw me off ten minutes before? I
   took out my binoculars and scanned the gaping crowd at the edge of the
   village. No-they did not seem to be looking for any comic climax; yet was
   not the whole affair at bottom a colossal joke in which all the villagers
   and reservation people were concerned-legends, manuscript, cylinder, and
   all? I thought of how I had seen the sentry from a distance, and then
   found him unaccountably vanished; thought also of the conduct of old Grey
   Eagle, of the speech and expressions of Compton and his mother, and of the
   unmistakable fright of most of the Binger people. On the whole, it could
   not very well be a village-wide joke. The fear and the problem were surely
   real, though obviously there were one or two jesting daredevils in Binger
   who had stolen out to the mound and made off with the tools I had left.

   Everything else on the mound was as I had left it-brush cut by my machete,
   slight, bowl-like depression toward the north end, and the hole I had made
   with my trench-knife in digging up the magnetism-revealed cylinder.
   Deeming it too great a concession to the unknown jokers to return to
   Binger for another pick and shovel, I resolved to carry out my programme
   as best I could with the machete and trench-knife in my handbag; so
   extracting these, I set to work excavating the bowl-like depression which
   my eye had picked as the possible site of a former entrance to the mound.
   As I proceeded, I felt again the suggestion of a sudden wind blowing
   against me which I had noticed the day before-a suggestion which seemed
   stronger, and still more reminiscent of unseen, formless, opposing hands
   laid on my wrists, as I cut deeper and deeper through the root-tangled red
   soil and reached the exotic black loam beneath. The talisman around my
   neck appeared to twitch oddly in the breeze-not in any one direction, as
   when attracted by the buried cylinder, but vaguely and diffusely, in a
   manner wholly unaccountable.

   Then, quite without warning, the black, root-woven earth beneath my feet
   began to sink cracklingly, while I heard a faint sound of sifting, falling
   matter far below me. The obstructing wind, or forces, or hands now seemed
   to be operating from the very seat of the sinking, and I felt that they
   aided me by pushing as I leaped back out of the hole to avoid being
   involved in any cave-in. Bending down over the brink and hacking at the
   mould-caked root-tangle with my machete, I felt that they were against me
   again-but at no time were they strong enough to stop my work. The more
   roots I severed, the more falling matter I heard below. Finally the hole
   began to deepen of itself toward the centre, and I saw that the earth was
   sifting down into some large cavity beneath, so as to leave a good-sized
   aperture when the roots that had bound it were gone. A few more hacks of
   the machete did the trick, and with a parting cave-in and uprush of
   curiously chill and alien air the last barrier gave way. Under the morning
   sun yawned a huge opening at least three feet square, and shewing the top
   of a flight of stone steps down which the loose earth of the collapse was
   still sliding. My quest had come to something at last! With an elation of
   accomplishment almost overbalancing fear for the nonce, I replaced the
   trench-knife and machete in my handbag, took out my powerful electric
   torch, and prepared for a triumphant, lone, and utterly rash invasion of
   the fabulous nether world I had uncovered.

   It was rather hard getting down the first few steps, both because of the
   fallen earth which had choked them and because of a sinister up-pushing of
   a cold wind from below. The talisman around my neck swayed curiously, and
   I began to regret the disappearing square of daylight above me. The
   electric torch shewed dank, water-stained, and salt-encrusted walls
   fashioned of huge basalt blocks, and now and then I thought I descried
   some trace of carving beneath the nitrous deposits. I gripped my handbag
   more tightly, and was glad of the comforting weight of the sheriff's heavy
   revolver in my right-hand coat pocket. After a time the passage began to
   wind this way and that, and the staircase became free from obstructions.
   Carvings on the walls were now definitely traceable, and I shuddered when
   I saw how clearly the grotesque figures resembled the monstrous
   bas-reliefs on the cylinder I had found. Winds and forces continued to
   blow malevolently against me, and at one or two bends I half fancied the
   torch gave glimpses of thin, transparent shapes not unlike the sentinel on
   the mound as my binoculars had shewed him. When I reached this stage of
   visual chaos I stopped for a moment to get a grip on myself. It would not
   do to let my nerves get the better of me at the very outset of what would
   surely be a trying experience, and the most important archaeological feat
   of my career.

   But I wished I had not stopped at just that place, for the act fixed my
   attention on something profoundly disturbing. It was only a small object
   lying close to the wall on one of the steps below me, but that object was
   such as to put my reason to a severe test, and bring up a line of the most
   alarming speculations. That the opening above me had been closed against
   all material forms for generations was utterly obvious from the growth of
   shrub-roots and accumulation of drifting soil; yet the object before me
   was most distinctly not many generations old. For it was an electric torch
   much like the one I now carried-warped and encrusted in the tomb-like
   dampness, but none the less perfectly unmistakable. I descended a few
   steps and picked it up, wiping off the evil deposits on my rough coat. One
   of the nickel bands bore an engraved name and address, and I recognised it
   with a start the moment I made it out. It read "Jas. C. Williams, 17
   Trowbridge St., Cambridge, Mass."-and I knew that it had belonged to one
   of the two daring college instructors who had disappeared on June 28,
   1915. Only thirteen years ago, and yet I had just broken through the sod
   of centuries! How had the thing got there? Another entrance-or was there
   something after all in this mad idea of dematerialisation and
   rematerialisation?

   Doubt and horror grew upon me as I wound still farther down the seemingly
   endless staircase. Would the thing never stop? The carvings grew more and
   more distinct, and assumed a narrative pictorial quality which brought me
   close to panic as I recognised many unmistakable correspondences with the
   history of K'n-yan as sketched in the manuscript now resting in my
   handbag. For the first time I began seriously to question the wisdom of my
   descent, and to wonder whether I had not better return to the upper air
   before I came upon something which would never let me return as a sane
   man. But I did not hesitate long, for as a Virginian I felt the blood of
   ancestral fighters and gentlemen-adventurers pounding a protest against
   retreat from any peril known or unknown.

   My descent became swifter rather than slower, and I avoided studying the
   terrible bas-reliefs and intaglios that had unnerved me. All at once I saw
   an arched opening ahead, and realised that the prodigious staircase had
   ended at last. But with that realisation came horror in mounting
   magnitude, for before me there yawned a vast vaulted crypt of
   all-too-familiar outline-a great circular space answering in every least
   particular to the carving-lined chamber described in the Zamacona
   manuscript.

   It was indeed the place. There could be no mistake. And if any room for
   doubt yet remained, that room was abolished by what I saw directly across
   the great vault. It was a second arched opening, commencing a long, narrow
   passage and having at its mouth two huge opposite niches bearing loathsome
   and titanic images of shockingly familiar pattern. There in the dark
   unclean Yig and hideous Tulu squatted eternally, glaring at each other
   across the passage as they had glared since the earliest youth of the
   human world.

   From this point onward I ask no credence for what I tell-for what I think
   I saw. It is too utterly unnatural, too utterly monstrous and incredible,
   to be any part of sane human experience or objective reality. My torch,
   though casting a powerful beam ahead, naturally could not furnish any
   general illumination of the Cyclopean crypt; so I now began moving it
   about to explore the giant walls little by little. As I did so, I saw to
   my horror that the space was by no means vacant, but was instead littered
   with odd furniture and utensils and heaps of packages which bespoke a
   populous recent occupancy-no nitrous reliques of the past, but queerly
   shaped objects and supplies in modern, every-day use. As my torch rested
   on each article or group of articles, however, the distinctness of the
   outlines soon began to grow blurred; until in the end I could scarcely
   tell whether the things belonged to the realm of matter or to the realm of
   spirit.

   All this while the adverse winds blew against me with increasing fury, and
   the unseen hands plucked malevolently at me and snatched at the strange
   magnetic talisman I wore. Wild conceits surged through my mind. I thought
   of the manuscript and what it said about the garrison stationed in this
   place-twelve dead slave y'm-bhi and six living but partly dematerialised
   freemen-that was in 1545-three hundred and eighty-three years ago.... What
   since then? Zamacona had predicted change ... subtle disintegration ...
   more dematerialisation ... weaker and weaker ... was it Grey Eagle's
   talisman that held them at bay-their sacred Tulu-metal-and were they
   feebly trying to pluck it off so that they might do to me what they had
   done to those who had come before?... It occurred to me with shuddering
   force that I was building my speculations out of a full belief in the
   Zamacona manuscript-this must not be-I must get a grip on myself-

   But, curse it, every time I tried to get a grip I saw some fresh sight to
   shatter my poise still further. This time, just as my will power was
   driving the half-seen paraphernalia into obscurity, my glance and
   torch-beam had to light on two things of very different nature; two things
   of the eminently real and sane world; yet they did more to unseat my shaky
   reason than anything I had seen before-because I knew what they were, and
   knew how profoundly, in the course of Nature, they ought not to be there.
   They were my own missing pick and shovel, side by side, and leaning neatly
   against the blasphemously carved wall of that hellish crypt. God in
   heaven-and I had babbled to myself about daring jokers from Binger!

   That was the last straw. After that the cursed hypnotism of the manuscript
   got at me, and I actually saw the half-transparent shapes of the things
   that were pushing and plucking; pushing and plucking-those leprous
   palaeogean things with something of humanity still clinging to them-the
   complete forms, and the forms that were morbidly and perversely incomplete
   ... all these, and hideous other entities-the four-footed blasphemies with
   ape-like face and projecting horn ... and not a sound so far in all that
   nitrous hell of inner earth....

   Then there was a sound-a flopping; a padding; a dull, advancing sound
   which heralded beyond question a being as structurally material as the
   pickaxe and the shovel-something wholly unlike the shadow-shapes that
   ringed me in, yet equally remote from any sort of life as life is
   understood on the earth's wholesome surface. My shattered brain tried to
   prepare me for what was coming, but could not frame any adequate image. I
   could only say over and over again to myself, "It is of the abyss, but it
   is not dematerialised." The padding grew more distinct, and from the
   mechanical cast of the tread I knew it was a dead thing that stalked in
   the darkness. Then-oh, God, I saw it in the full beam of my torch; saw it
   framed like a sentinel in the narrow passage between the nightmare idols
   of the serpent Yig and the octopus Tulu....

   Let me collect myself enough to hint at what I saw; to explain why I
   dropped torch and handbag and fled empty-handed in the utter blackness,
   wrapped in a merciful unconsciousness which did not wear off until the sun
   and the distant yelling and the shouting from the village roused me as I
   lay gasping on the top of the accursed mound, I do not yet know what
   guided me again to the earth's surface. I only know that the watchers in
   Binger saw me stagger up into sight three hours after I had vanished; saw
   me lurch up and fall flat on the ground as if struck by a bullet. None of
   them dared to come out and help me; but they knew I must be in a bad
   state, so tried to rouse me as best they could by yelling in chorus and
   firing off revolvers.

   It worked in the end, and when I came to I almost rolled down the side of
   the mound in my eagerness to get away from that black aperture which still
   yawned open. My torch and tools, and the handbag with the manuscript, were
   all down there; but it is easy to see why neither I nor anyone else ever
   went after them. When I staggered across the plain and into the village I
   dared not tell what I had seen. I only muttered vague things about
   carvings and statues and snakes and shaken nerves. And I did not faint
   again until somebody mentioned that the ghost-sentinel had reappeared
   about the time I had staggered half way back to town. I left Binger that
   evening, and have never been there since, though they tell me the ghosts
   still appear on the mound as usual.

   But I have resolved to hint here at last what I dared not hint to the
   people of Binger on that terrible August afternoon. I don't know yet just
   how I can go about it-and if in the end you think my reticence strange,
   just remember that to imagine such a horror is one thing, but to see it is
   another thing. I saw it. I think you'll recall my citing early in this
   tale the case of a bright young man named Heaton who went out to that
   mound one day in 1891 and came back at night as the village idiot,
   babbling for eight years about horrors and then dying in an epileptic fit.
   What he used to keep moaning was "That white man-oh, my God, what they did
   to him...."

   Well, I saw the same thing that poor Heaton saw-and I saw it after reading
   the manuscript, so I know more of its history than he did. That makes it
   worse-for I know all that it implies; all that must be still brooding and
   festering and waiting down there. I told you it had padded mechanically
   toward me out of the narrow passage and had stood sentry-like at the
   entrance between the frightful eidola of Yig and Tulu. That was very
   natural and inevitable-because the thing was a sentry. It had been made a
   sentry for punishment, and it was quite dead-besides lacking head, arms,
   lower legs, and other customary parts of a human being. Yes-it had been a
   very human being once; and what is more, it had been white. Very
   obviously, if that manuscript was as true as I think it was, this being
   had been used for the diversions of the amphitheatre before its life had
   become wholly extinct and supplanted by automatic impulses controlled from
   outside.

   On its white and only slightly hairy chest some letters had been gashed or
   branded-I had not stopped to investigate, but had merely noted that they
   were in an awkward and fumbling Spanish; an awkward Spanish implying a
   kind of ironic use of the language by an alien inscriber familiar neither
   with the idiom nor the Roman letters used to record it. The inscription
   had read "Secuestrado a la voluntad de Xinaian en el cuerpo decapitado de
   Tlayub"-"Seized by the will of K'n-yan in the headless body of T'la-yub."
