   Atop the tallest of earth's peaks dwell the gods of earth, and suffer not
   man to tell that he hath looked upon them. Lesser peaks they once
   inhabited; but ever the men from the plains would scale the slopes of rock
   and snow, driving the gods to higher and higher mountains till now only
   the last remains. When they left their old peaks they took with them all
   signs of themselves, save once, it is said, when they left a carven image
   on the face of the mountain which they called Ngranek.

   But now they have betaken themselves to unknown Kadath in the cold waste
   where no man treads, and are grown stern, having no higher peak whereto to
   flee at the coming of men. They are grown stern, and where once they
   suffered men to displace them, they now forbid men to come; or coming, to
   depart. It is well for men that they know not of Kadath in the cold waste;
   else they would seek injudiciously to scale it.

   Sometimes when earth's gods are homesick they visit in the still of the
   night the peaks where once they dwelt, and weep softly as they try to play
   in the olden way on remembered slopes. Men have felt the tears of the gods
   on white-capped Thurai, though they have thought it rain; and have heard
   the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn-winds of Lerion. In
   cloud-ships the gods are wont to travel, and wise cotters have legends
   that keep them from certain high peaks at night when it is cloudy, for the
   gods are not lenient as of old.

   In Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, once dwelt an old man avid to
   behold the gods of earth; a man deeply learned in the seven cryptical
   books of earth, and familiar with the Pnakotic Manuscripts of distant and
   frozen Lomar. His name was Barzai the Wise, and the villagers tell of how
   he went up a mountain on the night of the strange eclipse.

   Barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and
   goings, and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god
   himself. It was he who wisely advised the burgesses of Ulthar when they
   passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats, and who first
   told the young priest Atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on
   St. John's Eve. Barzai was learned in the lore of the earth's gods, and
   had gained a desire to look upon their faces. He believed that his great
   secret knowledge of gods could shield him from their wrath, so resolved to
   go up to the summit of high and rocky Hatheg-Kla on a night when he knew
   the gods would be there.

   Hatheg-Kla is far in the stony desert beyond Hatheg, for which it is
   named, and rises like a rock statue in a silent temple. Around its peak
   the mists play always mournfully, for mists are the memories of the gods,
   and the gods loved Hatheg-Kla when they dwelt upon it in the old days.
   Often the gods of earth visit Hatheg-Kla in their ships of clouds, casting
   pale vapors over the slopes as they dance reminiscently on the summit
   under a clear moon. The villagers of Hatheg say it is ill to climb the
   Hatheg-Kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapors
   hide the summit and the moon; but Barzai heeded them not when he came from
   neighboring Ulthar with the young priest Atal, who was his disciple. Atal
   was only the son of an innkeeper, and was sometimes afraid; but Barzai's
   father had been a landgrave who dwelt in an ancient castle, so he had no
   common superstition in his blood, and only laughed at the fearful cotters.

   Barzai and Atal went out of Hatheg into the stony desert despite the
   prayers of peasants, and talked of earth's gods by their campfires at
   night. Many days they traveled, and from afar saw lofty Hatheg-Kla with
   his aureole of mournful mist. On the thirteenth day they reached the
   mountain's lonely base, and Atal spoke of his fears. But Barzai was old
   and learned and had no fears, so led the way up the slope that no man had
   scaled since the time of Sansu, who is written of with fright in the moldy
   Pnakotic Manuscripts.

   The way was rocky, and made perilous by chasms, cliffs, and falling
   stones. Later it grew cold and snowy; and Barzai and Atal often slipped
   and fell as they hewed and plodded upward with staves and axes. Finally
   the air grew thin, and the sky changed color, and the climbers found it
   hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up, marveling at the
   strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would happen
   on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread around.
   For three days they climbed higher and higher toward the roof of the
   world; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon.

   For four nights no clouds came, and the moon shone down cold through the
   thin mournful mist around the silent pinnacle. Then on the fifth night,
   which was the night of the full moon, Barzai saw some dense clouds far to
   the north, and stayed up with Atal to watch them draw near. Thick and
   majestic they sailed, slowly and deliberately onward; ranging themselves
   round the peak high above the watchers, and hiding the moon and the summit
   from view. For a long hour the watchers gazed, whilst the vapours swirled
   and the screen of clouds grew thicker and more restless. Barzai was wise
   in the lore of earth's gods, and listened hard for certain sounds, but
   Atal felt the chill of the vapours and the awe of the night, and feared
   much. And when Barzai began to climb higher and beckon eagerly, it was
   long before Atal would follow.

   So thick were the vapours that the way was hard, and though Atal followed
   at last, he could scarce see the gray shape of Barzai on the dim slope
   above in the clouded moonlight. Barzai forged very far ahead, and seemed
   despite his age to climb more easily than Atal; fearing not the steepness
   that began to grow too great for any save a strong and dauntless man, nor
   pausing at wide black chasms that Atal could scarce leap. And so they went
   up wildly over rocks and gulfs, slipping and stumbling, and sometimes awed
   at the vastness and horrible silence of bleak ice pinnacles and mute
   granite steeps.

   Very suddenly Barzai went out of Atal's sight, scaling a hideous cliff
   that seemed to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not
   inspired of earth's gods. Atal was far below, and planning what he should
   do when he reached the place, when curiously he noticed that the light had
   grown strong, as if the cloudless peak and moonlit meetingplace of the
   gods were very near. And as he scrambled on toward the bulging cliff and
   litten sky he felt fears more shocking than any he had known before. Then
   through the high mists he heard the voice of Barzai shouting wildly in
   delight:

   "I have heard the gods. I have heard earth's gods singing in revelry on
   Hatheg-Kla! The voices of earth's gods are known to Barzai the Prophet!
   The mists are thin and the moon is bright, and I shall see the gods
   dancing wildly on Hatheg-Kla that they loved in youth. The wisdom of
   Barzai hath made him greater than earth's gods, and against his will their
   spells and barriers are as naught; Barzai will behold the gods, the proud
   gods, the secret gods, the gods of earth who spurn the sight of man!"

   Atal could not hear the voices Barzai heard, but he was now close to the
   bulging cliff and scanning it for footholds. Then he heard Barzai's voice
   grow shriller and louder:

   "The mist is very thin, and the moon casts shadows on the slope; the
   voices of earth's gods are high and wild, and they fear the coming of
   Barzai the Wise, who is greater than they... The moon's light flickers, as
   earth's gods dance against it; I shall see the dancing forms of the gods
   that leap and howl in the moonlight... The light is dimmer and the gods
   are afraid..."

   Whilst Barzai was shouting these things Atal felt a spectral change in all
   the air, as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for though
   the way was steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown fearsomely
   easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it
   and slid perilously up its convex face. The light of the moon had
   strangely failed, and as Atal plunged upward through the mists he heard
   Barzai the Wise shrieking in the shadows:

   "The moon is dark, and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in the
   sky, for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of men or
   of earth's gods... There is unknown magic on Hatheg-Kla, for the screams
   of the frightened gods have turned to laughter, and the slopes of ice
   shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither I am plunging... Hei!
   Hei! At last! In the dim light I behold the gods of earth!"

   And now Atal, slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps, heard in the
   dark a loathsome laughing, mixed with such a cry as no man else ever heard
   save in the Phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares; a cry wherein
   reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted lifetime packed into one
   atrocious moment:

   "The other gods! The other gods! The gods of the outer hells that guard
   the feeble gods of earth!... Look away... Go back... Do not see! Do not
   see! The vengeance of the infinite abysses... That cursed, that damnable
   pit... Merciful gods of earth, I am falling into the sky!"

   And as Atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to hump downward
   against the frightful pull from unknown heights, there resounded on
   Hatheg-Kla that terrible peal of thunder which awaked the good cotters of
   the plains and the honest burgesses of Hatheg, Nir and Ulthar, and caused
   them to behold through the clouds that strange eclipse of the moon that no
   book ever predicted. And when the moon came out at last Atal was safe on
   the lower snows of the mountain without sight of earth's gods, or of the
   other gods.

   Now it is told in the moldy Pnakotic Manuscripts that Sansu found naught
   but wordless ice and rock when he did climb Hatheg-Kla in the youth of the
   world. Yet when the men of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg crushed their fears
   and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of Barzai the Wise, they
   found graven in the naked stone of the summit a curious and cyclopean
   symbol fifty cubits wide, as if the rock had been riven by some titanic
   chisel. And the symbol was like to one that learned men have discerned in
   those frightful parts of the Pnakotic Manuscripts which were too ancient
   to be read. This they found.

   Barzai the Wise they never found, nor could the holy priest Atal ever be
   persuaded to pray for his soul's repose. Moreover, to this day the people
   of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg fear eclipses, and pray by night when pale
   vapors hide the mountain-top and the moon. And above the mists on
   Hatheg-Kla, earth's gods sometimes dance reminiscently; for they know they
   are safe, and love to come from unknown Kadath in ships of clouds and play
   in the olden way, as they did when earth was new and men not given to the
   climbing of inaccessible places.
