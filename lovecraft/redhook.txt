                                       I

   Not many weeks ago, on a street corner in the village of Pascoag, Rhode
   Island, a tall, heavily built, and wholesome-looking pedestrian furnished
   much speculation by a singular lapse of behaviour. He had, it appears,
   been descending the hill by the road from Chepachet; and encountering the
   compact section, had turned to his left into the main thoroughfare where
   several modest business blocks convey a touch of the urban. At this point,
   without visible provocation, he committed his astonishing lapse; staring
   queerly for a second at the tallest of the buildings before him, and then,
   with a series of terrified, hysterical shrieks, breaking into a frantic
   run which ended in a stumble and fall at the next crossing. Picked up and
   dusted off by ready hands, he was found to be conscious, organically
   unhurt, and evidently cured of his sudden nervous attack. He muttered some
   shamefaced explanations involving a strain he had undergone, and with
   downcast glance turned back up the Chepachet road, trudging out of sight
   without once looking behind him. It was a strange incident to befall so
   large, robust, normal-featured, and capable-looking a man, and the
   strangeness was not lessened by the remarks of a bystander who had
   recognised him as the boarder of a well-known dairyman on the outskirts of
   Chepachet.

   He was, it developed, a New York police detective named Thomas F. Malone,
   now on a long leave of absence under medical treatment after some
   disproportionately arduous work on a gruesome local case which accident
   had made dramatic. There had been a collapse of several old brick
   buildings during a raid in which he had shared, and something about the
   wholesale loss of life, both of prisoners and of his companions, had
   peculiarly appalled him. As a result, he had acquired an acute and
   anomalous horror of any buildings even remotely suggesting the ones which
   had fallen in, so that in the end mental specialists forbade him the sight
   of such things for an indefinite period. A police surgeon with relatives
   in Chepachet had put forward that quaint hamlet of wooden colonial houses
   as an ideal spot for the psychological convalescence; and thither the
   sufferer had gone, promising never to venture among the brick-lined
   streets of larger villages till duly advised by the Woonsocket specialist
   with whom he was put in touch. This walk to Pascoag for magazines had been
   a mistake, and the patient had paid in fright, bruises, and humiliation
   for his disobedience.

   So much the gossips of Chepachet and Pascoag knew; and so much, also, the
   most learned specialists believed. But Malone had at first told the
   specialists much more, ceasing only when he saw that utter incredulity was
   his portion. Thereafter he held his peace, protesting not at all when it
   was generally agreed that the collapse of certain squalid brick houses in
   the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, and the consequent death of many brave
   officers, had unseated his nervous equilibrium. He had worked too hard,
   all said, it trying to clean up those nests of disorder and violence;
   certain features were shocking enough, in all conscience, and the
   unexpected tragedy was the last straw. This was a simple explanation which
   everyone could understand, and because Malone was not a simple person he
   perceived that he had better let it suffice. To hint to unimaginative
   people of a horror beyond all human conception - a horror of houses and
   blocks and cities leprous and cancerous with evil dragged from elder
   worlds - would be merely to invite a padded cell instead of a restful
   rustication, and Malone was a man of sense despite his mysticism. He had
   the Celt's far vision of weird and hidden things, but the logician's quick
   eye for the outwardly unconvincing; an amalgam which had led him far
   afield in the forty-two years of his life, and set him in strange places
   for a Dublin University man born in a Georgian villa near Phoenix Park.

   And now, as he reviewed the things he had seen and felt and apprehended,
   Malone was content to keep unshared the secret of what could reduce a
   dauntless fighter to a quivering neurotic; what could make old brick slums
   and seas of dark, subtle faces a thing of nightmare and eldritch portent.
   It would not be the first time his sensations had been forced to bide
   uninterpreted - for was not his very act of plunging into the polyglot
   abyss of New York's underworld a freak beyond sensible explanation? What
   could he tell the prosaic of the antique witcheries and grotesque marvels
   discernible to sensitive eyes amidst the poison cauldron where all the
   varied dregs of unwholesome ages mix their venom and perpetuate their
   obscene terrors? He had seen the hellish green flame of secret wonder in
   this blatant, evasive welter of outward greed and inward blasphemy, and
   had smiled gently when all the New-Yorkers he knew scoffed at his
   experiment in police work. They had been very witty and cynical, deriding
   his fantastic pursuit of unknowable mysteries and assuring him that in
   these days New York held nothing but cheapness and vulgarity. One of them
   had wagered him a heavy sum that he could not - despite many poignant
   things to his credit in the Dublin Review - even write a truly interesting
   story of New York low life; and now, looking back, he perceived that
   cosmic irony had justified the prophet's words while secretly confuting
   their flippant meaning. The horror, as glimpsed at last, could not make a
   story - for like the book cited by Poe's Germany authority, 'es la:sst
   sich nicht lesen - it does not permit itself to be read.'

                                       II

   To Malone the sense of latent mystery in existence was always present. In
   youth he had felt the hidden beauty and ecstasy of things, and had been a
   poet; but poverty and sorrow and exile had turned his gaze in darker
   directions, and he had thrilled at the imputations of evil in the world
   around. Daily life had fur him come to be a phantasmagoria of macabre
   shadow-studies; now glittering and leering with concealed rottenness as in
   Beardsley's best manner, now hinting terrors behind the commonest shapes
   and objects as in the subtler and less obvious work of Gustave Dore. He
   would often regard it as merciful that most persons of high Intelligence
   jeer at the inmost mysteries; for, he argued, if superior minds were ever
   placed in fullest contact with the secrets preserved by ancient and lowly
   cults, the resultant abnormalities would soon not only wreck the world,
   but threaten the very integrity of the universe. All this reflection was
   no doubt morbid, but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it.
   Malone was satisfied to let his notions remain as half-spied and forbidden
   visions to be lightly played with; and hysteria came only when duty flung
   him into a hell of revelation too sudden and insidious to escape.

   He had for some time been detailed to the Butler Street station in
   Brooklyn when the Red Hook matter came to his notice. Red Hook is a maze
   of hybrid squalor near the ancient waterfront opposite Governor's Island,
   with dirty highways climbing the hill from the wharves to that higher
   ground where the decayed lengths of Clinton and Court Streets lead off
   toward the Borough Hall. Its houses are mostly of brick, dating from the
   first quarter to the middle of the nineteenth century, and some of the
   obscurer alleys and byways have that alluring antique flavour which
   conventional reading leads us to call 'Dickensian'. The population is a
   hopeless tangle and enigma; Syrian, Spanish, Italian, and Negro elements
   impinging upon one another, and fragments of Scandinavian and American
   belts lying not far distant. It is a babel of sound and filth, and sends
   out strange cries to answer the lapping oily waves at its grimy piers and
   the monstrous organ litanies of the harbour whistles. Here long ago a
   brighter picture dwelt, with clear-eyed mariners on the lower streets and
   homes of taste and substance where the larger houses line the hill. One
   can trace the relics of this former happiness in the trim shapes of the
   buildings, the occasional graceful churches, and the evidences of original
   art and background in bits of detail here and there - a worn flight of
   steps, a battered doorway, a wormy pair of decorative columns or
   pilasters, or a fragment of once green space with bent and rusted iron
   railing. The houses are generally in solid blocks, and now and then a
   many-windowed cupola arises to tell of days when the households of
   captains and ship-owners watched the sea.

   From this tangle of material and spiritual putrescence the blasphemies of
   an hundred dialects assail the sky. Hordes of prowlers reel shouting and
   singing along the lanes and thoroughfares, occasional furtive hands
   suddenly extinguish lights and pull down curtains, and swarthy, sin-pitted
   faces disappear from windows when visitors pick their way through.
   Policemen despair of order or reform, and seek rather to erect barriers
   protecting the outside world from the contagion. The clang of the patrol
   is answered by a kind of spectral silence, and such prisoners as are taken
   are never communicative. Visible offences are as varied as the local
   dialects, and run the gamut from the smuggling of rum and prohibited
   aliens through diverse stages of lawlessness and obscure vice to murder
   and mutilation in their most abhorrent guises. That these visible affairs
   are not more frequent is not to the neighbourhood's credit, unless the
   power of concealment be an art demanding credit. More people enter Red
   Hook than leave it - or at least, than leave it by the landward side - and
   those who are not loquacious are the likeliest to leave.

   Malone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more
   terrible than any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by
   priests and philanthropists. He was conscious, as one who united
   imagination with scientific knowledge, that modern people under lawless
   conditions tend uncannily to repeat the darkest instinctive patterns of
   primitive half-ape savagery in their daily life and ritual observances;
   and he had often viewed with an anthropologist's shudder the chanting,
   cursing processions of blear-eyed and pockmarked young men which wound
   their way along in the dark small hours of morning. One saw groups of
   these youths incessantly; sometimes in leering vigils on street corners,
   sometimes in doorways playing eerily on cheap instruments of music,
   sometimes in stupefied dozes or indecent dialogues around cafeteria tables
   near Borough Hall, and sometimes in whispering converse around dingy
   taxicabs drawn up at the high stoops of crumbling and closely shuttered
   old houses. They chilled and fascinated him more than he dared confess to
   his associates on the force, for he seemed to see in them some monstrous
   thread of secret continuity; some fiendish, cryptical, and ancient pattern
   utterly beyond and below the sordid mass of facts and habits and haunts
   listed with such conscientious technical care by the police. They must be,
   he felt inwardly, the heirs of some shocking and primordial tradition; the
   sharers of debased and broken scraps from cults and ceremonies older than
   mankind. Their coherence and definiteness suggested it, and it shewed in
   the singular suspicion of order which lurked beneath their squalid
   disorder. He had not read in vain such treatises as Miss Murray's
   Witch-Cult in Western Europe; and knew that up to recent years there had
   certainly survived among peasants and furtive folk a frightful and
   clandestine system of assemblies and orgies descended from dark religions
   antedating the Aryan world, and appearing in popular legends as Black
   Masses and Witches' Sabbaths. That these hellish vestiges of old
   Turanian-Asiatic magic and fertility cults were even now wholly dead he
   could not for a moment suppose, and he frequently wondered how much older
   and how much blacker than the very worst of the muttered tales some of
   them might really be.

                                      III

   It was the case of Robert Suydam which took Malone to the heart of things
   in Red Hook. Suydam was a lettered recluse of ancient Dutch family,
   possessed originally of barely independent means, and inhabiting the
   spacious but ill-preserved mansion which his grandfather had built in
   Flatbush when that village was little more than a pleasant group of
   colonial cottages surrounding the steepled and ivy-clad Reformed Church
   with its iron-railed yard of Netherlandish gravestones. In his lonely
   house, set back from Martense Street amidst a yard of venerable trees,
   Suydam had read and brooded for some six decades except for a period a
   generation before, when he had sailed for the old world and remained there
   out of sight for eight years. He could afford no servants, and would admit
   but few visitors to his absolute solitude; eschewing close friendships and
   receiving his rare acquaintances in one of the three ground-floor rooms
   which he kept in order - a vast, high-ceiled library whose walls were
   solidly packed with tattered books of ponderous, archaic, and vaguely
   repellent aspect. The growth of the town and its final absorption in the
   Brooklyn district had meant nothing to Suydam, and he had come to mean
   less and less to the town. Elderly people still pointed him out on the
   streets, but to most of the recent population he was merely a queer,
   corpulent old fellow whose unkempt white hair, stubbly beard, shiny black
   clothes, and gold-headed cane earned him an amused glance and nothing
   more. Malone did not know him by sight till duty called him to the case,
   but had heard of him indirectly as a really profound authority on
   mediaeval superstition, and had once idly meant to look up an out-of-print
   pamphlet of his on the Kabbalah and the Faustus legend, which a friend had
   quoted from memory.

   Suydam became a case when his distant and only relatives sought court
   pronouncements on his sanity. Their action seemed sudden to the outside
   world, but was really undertaken only after prolonged observation and
   sorrowful debate. It was based on certain odd changes in his speech and
   habits; wild references to impending wonders, and unaccountable hauntings
   of disreputable Brooklyn neighbourhoods. He had been growing shabbier and
   shabbier with the years, and now prowled about like a veritable mendicant;
   seen occasionally by humiliated friends in subway stations, or loitering
   on the benches around Borough Hall in conversation with groups of swarthy,
   evil-looking strangers. When he spoke it was to babble of unlimited powers
   almost within his grasp, and to repeat with knowing leers such mystical
   words or names as 'Sephiroth', 'Ashmodai', and 'Samael'. The court action
   revealed that he was using up his income and wasting his principal in the
   purchase of curious tomes imported from London and Paris, and in the
   maintenance of a squalid basement flat in the Red Hook district where he
   spent nearly every night, receiving odd delegations of mixed rowdies and
   foreigners, and apparently conducting some kind of ceremonial service
   behind the green blinds of secretive windows. Detectives assigned to
   follow him reported strange cries and chants and prancing of feet
   filtering out from these nocturnal rites, and shuddered at their peculiar
   ecstasy and abandon despite the commonness of weird orgies in that sodden
   section. When, however, the matter came to a hearing, Suydam managed to
   preserve his liberty. Before the judge his manner grew urbane and
   reasonable, and he freely admitted the queerness of demeanour and
   extravagant cast of language into which he had fallen through excessive
   devotion to study and research. He was, he said, engaged in the
   investigation of certain details of European tradition which required the
   closest contact with foreign groups and their songs and folk dances. The
   notion that any low secret society was preying upon him, as hinted by his
   relatives, was obviously absurd; and shewed how sadly limited was their
   understanding of him and his work. Triumphing with his calm explanations,
   he was suffered to depart unhindered; and the paid detectives of the
   Suydams, Corlears, and Van Brunts were withdrawn in resigned disgust.

   It was here that an alliance of Federal inspectors and police, Malone with
   them, entered the case. The law had watched the Suydam action with
   interest, and had in many instances been called upon to aid the private
   detectives. In this work it developed that Suydam's new associates were
   among the blackest and most vicious criminals of Red Hook's devious lanes,
   and that at least a third of them were known and repeated offenders in the
   matter of thievery, disorder, and the importation of illegal immigrants.
   Indeed, it would not have been too much to say that the old scholar's
   particular circle coincided almost perfectly with the worst of the
   organized cliques which smuggled ashore certain nameless and unclassified
   Asian dregs wisely turned back by Ellis Island. In the teeming rookeries
   of Parker Place - since renamed - where Suydam had his basement flat,
   there had grown up a very unusual colony of unclassified slant-eyed folk
   who used the Arabic alphabet but were eloquently repudiated by the great
   mass of Syrians in and around Atlantic Avenue. They could all have been
   deported for lack of credentials, but legalism is slow-moving, and one
   does not disturb Red Hook unless publicity forces one to.

   These creatures attended a tumbledown stone church, used Wednesdays as a
   dance-hall, which reared its Gothic buttresses near the vilest part of the
   waterfront. It was nominally Catholic; but priests throughout Brooklyn
   denied the place all standing and authenticity, and policemen agreed with
   them when they listened to the noises it emitted at night. Malone used to
   fancy he heard terrible cracked bass notes from a hidden organ far
   underground when the church stood empty and unlighted, whilst all
   observers dreaded the shrieking and drumming which accompanied the visible
   services. Suydam, when questioned, said he thought the ritual was some
   remnant of Nestorian Christianity tinctured with the Shamanism of Thibet.
   Most of the people, he conjectured, were of Mongoloid stock, originating
   somewhere in or near Kurdistan - and Malone could not help recalling that
   Kurdistan is the land of the Yezidis, last survivors of the Persian
   devil-worshippers. However this may have been, the stir of the Suydam
   investigation made it certain that these unauthorised newcomers were
   flooding Red Hook in increasing numbers; entering through some marine
   conspiracy unreached by revenue officers and harbour police, overrunning
   Parker Place and rapidly spreading up the hill, and welcomed with curious
   fraternalism by the other assorted denizens of the region. Their squat
   figures and characteristic squinting physiognomies, grotesquely combined
   with flashy American clothing, appeared more and more numerously among the
   loafers and nomad gangsters of the Borough Hall section; till at length it
   was deemed necessary to compute their numbers, ascertain their sources and
   occupations, and find if possible a way to round them up and deliver them
   to the proper immigration authorities. To this task Malone was assigned by
   agreement of Federal and city forces, and as he commenced his canvass of
   Red Hook he felt poised upon the brink of nameless terrors, with the
   shabby, unkempt figure of Robert Suydam as arch-fiend and adversary.

                                       IV

   Police methods are varied and ingenious. Malone, through unostentatious
   rambles, carefully casual conversations, well-timed offers of hip-pocket
   liquor, and judicious dialogues with frightened prisoners, learned many
   isolated facts about the movement whose aspect had become so menacing. The
   newcomers were indeed Kurds, but of a dialect obscure and puzzling to
   exact philology. Such of them as worked lived mostly as dock-hands and
   unlicenced pedlars, though frequently serving in Greek restaurants and
   tending corner news stands. Most of them, however, had no visible means of
   support; and were obviously connected with underworld pursuits, of which
   smuggling and 'bootlegging' were the least indescribable. They had come in
   steamships, apparently tramp freighters, and had been unloaded by stealth
   on moonless nights in rowboats which stole under a certain wharf and
   followed a hidden canal to a secret subterranean pool beneath a house.
   This wharf, canal, and house Malone could not locate, for the memories of
   his informants were exceedingly confused, while their speech was to a
   great extent beyond even the ablest interpreters; nor could he gain any
   real data on the reasons for their systematic importation. They were
   reticent about the exact spot from which they had come, and were never
   sufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies which had sought them out
   and directed their course. Indeed, they developed something like acute
   fright when asked the reasons for their presence. Gangsters of other
   breeds were equally taciturn, and she most that could be gathered was that
   some god or great priesthood had promised them unheard-of powers and
   supernatural glories and rulerships in a strange land.

   The attendance of both newcomers and old gangsters at Suydam's closely
   guarded nocturnal meetings was very regular, and the police soon learned
   that the erstwhile recluse had leased additional flats to accommodate such
   guests as knew his password; at last occupying three entire houses and
   permanently harbouring many of his queer companions. He spent but little
   time now at his Flatbush home, apparently going and coming only to obtain
   and return books; and his face and manner had attained an appalling pitch
   of wildness. Malone twice interviewed him, but was each time brusquely
   repulsed. He knew nothing, he said, of any mysterious plots or movements;
   and had no idea how the Kurds could have entered or what they wanted. His
   business was to study undisturbed the folklore of all the immigrants of
   the district; a business with which policemen had no legitimate concern.
   Malone mentioned his admiration for Suydam's old brochure on the Kabbalah
   and other myths, but the old man's softening was only momentary. He sensed
   an intrusion, and rebuffed his visitor in no uncertain way; till Malone
   withdrew disgusted, and turned to other channels of information.

   What Malone would have unearthed could he have worked continuously on the
   case, we shall never know. As it was, a stupid conflict between city and
   Federal authority suspended the investigations for several months, during
   which the detective was busy with other assignments. But at no time did he
   lose interest, or fail to stand amazed at what began to happen to Robert
   Suydam. Just at the time when a wave of kidnappings and disappearances
   spread its excitement over New York, the unkempt scholar embarked upon a
   metamorphosis as startling as it was absurd. One day he was seen near
   Borough Hall with clean-shaved face, well-trimmed hair, and tastefully
   immaculate attire, and on every day thereafter some obscure improvement
   was noticed in him. He maintained his new fastidiousness without
   interruption, added to it an unwonted sparkle of eye and crispness of
   speech, and began little by little to shed the corpulence which had so
   long deformed him. Now frequently taken for less than his age, he acquired
   an elasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanour to match the new
   tradition, and shewed a curious darkening of the hair which somehow did
   not suggest dye. As the months passed, he commenced to dress less and less
   conservatively, and finally astonished his new friends by renovating and
   redecorating his Flatbush mansion, which he threw open in a series of
   receptions, summoning all the acquaintances he could remember, and
   extending a special welcome to the fully forgiven relatives who had so
   lately sought his restraint. Some attended through curiosity, others
   through duty; but all were suddenly charmed by the dawning grace and
   urbanity of the former hermit. He had, he asserted, accomplished most of
   his allotted work; and having just inherited some property from a
   half-forgotten European friend, was about to spend his remaining years in
   a brighter second youth which ease, care, and diet had made possible to
   him. Less and less was he seen at Red Hook, and more and more did he move
   in the society to which he was born. Policemen noted a tendency of the
   gangsters to congregate at the old stone church and dance-hall instead of
   at the basement flat in Parker Place, though the latter and its recent
   annexes still overflowed with noxious life.

   Then two incidents occurred - wide enough apart, but both of intense
   interest in the case as Malone envisaged it. One was a quiet announcement
   in the Eagle of Robert Suydam's engagement to Miss Cornelia Gerritsen of
   Bayside, a young woman of excellent position, and distantly related to the
   elderly bridegroom-elect; whilst the other was a raid on the dance-hall
   church by city police, after a report that the face of a kidnapped child
   had been seen for a second at one of the basement windows. Malone had
   participated in this raid, and studied the place with much care when
   inside. Nothing was found - in fact, the building was entirely deserted
   when visited - but the sensitive Celt was vaguely disturbed by many things
   about the interior. There were crudely painted panels he did not like -
   panels which depicted sacred faces with peculiarly worldly and sardonic
   expressions, and which occasionally took liberties that even a layman's
   sense of decorum could scarcely countenance. Then, too, he did not relish
   the Greek inscription on the wall above the pulpit; an ancient incantation
   which he had once stumbled upon in Dublin college days, and which read,
   literally translated,

     'O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of
     dogs and spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of shades among the
     tombs, who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorgo,
     Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look favourably on our sacrifices!'

   When he read this he shuddered, and thought vaguely of the cracked bass
   organ notes he fancied he had heard beneath the church on certain nights.
   He shuddered again at the rust around the rim of a metal basin which stood
   on the altar, and paused nervously when his nostrils seemed to detect a
   curious and ghastly stench from somewhere in the neighbourhood. That organ
   memory haunted him, and he explored the basement with particular assiduity
   before he left. The place was very hateful to him; yet after all, were the
   blasphemous panels and inscriptions more than mere crudities perpetrated
   by the ignorant?

   By the time of Suydam's wedding the kidnapping epidemic had become a
   popular newspaper scandal. Most of the victims were young children of the
   lowest classes, but the increasing number of disappearances had worked up
   a sentiment of the strongest fury. Journals clamoured for action from the
   police, and once more the Butler Street Station sent its men over Red Hook
   for clues, discoveries, and criminals. Malone was glad to be on the trail
   again, and took pride in a raid on one of Suydam's Parker Place houses.
   There, indeed, no stolen child was found, despite the tales of screams and
   the red sash picked up in the areaway; but the paintings and rough
   inscriptions on the peeling walls of most of the rooms, and the primitive
   chemical laboratory in the attic, all helped to convince the detective
   that he was on the track of something tremendous. The paintings were
   appalling - hideous monsters of every shape and size, and parodies on
   human outlines which cannot be described. The writing was in red, and
   varied from Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew letters. Malone could not
   read much of it, but what he did decipher was portentous and cabbalistic
   enough. One frequently repeated motto was in a Sort of Hebraised
   Hellenistic Greek, and suggested the most terrible daemon-evocations of
   the Alexandrian decadence:

     'HEL . HELOYM . SOTHER . EMMANVEL . SABAOTH . AGLA . TETRAGRAMMATON .
     AGYROS . OTHEOS . ISCHYROS . ATHANATOS . IEHOVA . VA . ADONAI . SADAY .
     HOMOVSION . MESSIAS . ESCHEREHEYE.'

   Circles and pentagrams loomed on every hand, and told indubitably of the
   strange beliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt so squalidly here. In
   the cellar, however, the strangest thing was found - a pile of genuine
   gold ingots covered carelessly with a piece of burlap, and bearing upon
   their shining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics which also adorned the
   walls. During the raid the police encountered only a passive resistance
   from the squinting Orientals that swarmed from every door. Finding nothing
   relevant, they had to leave all as it was; but the precinct captain wrote
   Suydam a note advising him to look closely to the character of his tenants
   and proteges in view of the growing public clamour.

                                       V

   Then came the June wedding and the great sensation. Flatbush was gay for
   the hour about high noon, and pennanted motors thronged the streets near
   the old Dutch church where an awning stretched from door to highway. No
   local event ever surpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen nuptials in tone and
   scale, and the party which escorted bride and groom to the Cunard Pier
   was, if not exactly the smartest, at least a solid page from the Social
   Register. At five o'clock adieux were waved, and the ponderous liner edged
   away from the long pier, slowly turned its nose seaward, discarded its
   tug, and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world
   wonders. By night the outer harbour was cleared, and late passengers
   watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted ocean.

   Whether the tramp steamer or the scream was first to gain attention, no
   one can say. Probably they were simultaneous, but it is of no use to
   calculate. The scream came from the Suydam stateroom, and the sailor who
   broke down the door could perhaps have told frightful things if he had not
   forthwith gone completely mad - as it is, he shrieked more loudly than the
   first victims, and thereafter ran simpering about the vessel till caught
   and put in irons. The ship's doctor who entered the stateroom and turned
   on the lights a moment later did not go mad, but told nobody what he saw
   till afterward, when he corresponded with Malone in Chepachet. It was
   murder - strangulation - but one need not say that the claw-mark on Mrs.
   Suydam's throat could not have come from her husband's or any other human
   hand, or that upon the white wall there flickered for an instant in
   hateful red a legend which, later copied from memory, seems to have been
   nothing less than the fearsome Chaldee letters of the word 'LILITH'. One
   need not mention these things because they vanished so quickly - as for
   Suydam, one could at least bar others from the room until one knew what to
   think oneself. The doctor has distinctly assured Malone that he did not
   see IT. The open porthole, just before he turned on the lights, was
   clouded for a second with a certain phosphorescence, and for a moment
   there seemed to echo in the night outside the suggestion of a faint and
   hellish tittering; but no real outline met the eye. As proof, the doctor
   points to his continued sanity.

   Then the tramp steamer claimed all attention. A boat put off, and a horde
   of swart, insolent ruffians in officers' dress swarmed aboard the
   temporarily halted Cunarder. They wanted Suydam or his body - they had
   known of his trip, and for certain reasons were sure he would die. The
   captain's deck was almost a pandemonium; for at the instant, between the
   doctor's report from the stateroom and the demands of the men from the
   tramp, not even the wisest and gravest seaman could think what to do.
   Suddenly the leader of the visiting mariners, an Arab with a hatefully
   negroid mouth, pulled forth a dirty, crumpled paper and handed it to the
   captain. It was signed by Robert Suydam, and bore the following odd
   message.

     In case of sudden or unexplained accident or death on my part, please
     deliver me or my body unquestioningly into the hands of the bearer and
     his associates. Everything, for me, and perhaps for you, depends on
     absolute compliance. Explanations can come later - do not fail me now.

                                                              - ROBERT SUYDAM

   Captain and doctor looked at each other, and the latter whispered
   something to the former. Finally they nodded rather helplessly and led the
   way to the Suydam stateroom. The doctor directed the captain's glance away
   as he unlocked the door and admitted the strange seamen, nor did he
   breathe easily till they filed out with their burden after an
   unaccountably long period of preparation. It was wrapped in bedding from
   the berths, and the doctor was glad that the outlines were not very
   revealing. Somehow the men got the thing over the side and away to their
   tramp steamer without uncovering it. The Cunarder started again, and the
   doctor and a ship's undertaker sought out the Suydam stateroorn to perform
   what last services they could. Once more the physician was forced to
   reticence and even to mendacity, for a hellish thing had happened. When
   the undertaker asked him why he had drained off all of Mrs. Suydam's
   blood, he neglected to affirm that he had not done so; nor did he point to
   the vacant bottle-spaces on the rack, or to the odour in the sink which
   shewed the hasty disposition of the bottles' original contents. The
   pockets of those men - if men they were - had bulged damnably when they
   left the ship. Two hours later, and the world knew by radio all that it
   ought to know of the horrible affair.

                                       VI

   That same June evening, without having heard a word from the sea, Malone
   was desperately busy among the alleys of Red Hook. A sudden stir seemed to
   permeate the place, and as if apprised by 'grapevine telegraph' of
   something singular, the denizens clustered expectantly around the
   dance-hall church and the houses in Parker Place. Three children had just
   disappeared - blue-eyed Norwegians from the streets toward Gowanus - and
   there were rumours of a mob forming among the sturdy Vikings of that
   section. Malone had for weeks been urging his colleagues to attempt a
   general cleanup; and at last, moved by conditions more obvious to their
   common sense than the conjectures of a Dublin dreamer, they had agreed
   upon a final stroke. The unrest and menace of this evening had been the
   deciding factor, and just about midnight a raiding party recruited from
   three stations descended upon Parker Place and its environs. Doors were
   battered in, stragglers arrested, and candlelighted rooms forced to
   disgorge unbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners in figured robes,
   mitres, and other inexplicable devices. Much was lost in the melee, for
   objects were thrown hastily down unexpected shafts, and betraying odours
   deadened by the sudden kindling of pungent incense. But spattered blood
   was everywhere, and Malone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier or altar
   from which the smoke was still rising.

   He wanted to be in several places at once, and decided on Suydam's
   basement flat only after a messenger had reported the complete emptiness
   of the dilapidated dance-hall church. The flat, he thought, must hold some
   due to a cult of which the occult scholar had so obviously become the
   centre and leader; and it was with real expectancy that he ransacked the
   musty rooms, noted their vaguely charnel odour, and examined the curious
   books, instruments, gold ingots, and glass-stoppered bottles scattered
   carelessly here and there. Once a lean, black-and-white cat edged between
   his feet and tripped him, overturning at the same time a beaker half full
   of a red liquid. The shock was severe, and to this day Malone is not
   certain of what he saw; but in dreams he still pictures that cat as it
   scuttled away with certain monstrous alterations and peculiarities. Then
   came the locked cellar door, and the search for something to break it
   down. A heavy stool stood near, and its tough seat was more than enough
   for the antique panels. A crack formed and enlarged, and the whole door
   gave way - but from the other side; whence poured a howling tumult of
   ice-cold wind with all the stenches of the bottomless pit, and whence
   reached a sucking force not of earth or heaven, which, coiling sentiently
   about the paralysed detective, dragged him through the aperture and down
   unmeasured spaces filled with whispers and wails, and gusts of mocking
   laughter.

   Of course it was a dream. All the specialists have told him so, and he has
   nothing to prove the contrary. Indeed, he would rather have it thus; for
   then the sight of old brick slums and dark foreign faces would not eat so
   deeply into his soul. But at the time it was all horribly real, and
   nothing can ever efface the memory of those nighted crypts, those titan
   arcades, and those half-formed shapes of hell that strode gigantically in
   silence holding half-eaten things whose still surviving portions screamed
   for mercy or laughed with madness. Odours of incense and corruption joined
   in sickening concert, and the black air was alive with the cloudy,
   semi-visible bulk of shapeless elemental things with eyes. Somewhere dark
   sticky water was lapping at onyx piers, and once the shivery tinkle of
   raucous little bells pealed out to greet the insane titter of a naked
   phosphorescent thing which swam into sight, scrambled ashore, and climbed
   up to squat leeringly on a carved golden pedestal in the background.

   Avenues of limitless night seemed to radiate in every direction, till one
   might fancy that here lay the root of a contagion destined to sicken and
   swallow cities, and engulf nations in the foetor of hybrid pestilence.
   Here cosmic sin had entered, and festered by unhallowed rites had
   commenced the grinning march of death that was to rot us all to fungous
   abnormalities too hideous for the grave's holding. Satan here held his
   Babylonish court, and in the blood of stainless childhood the leprous
   limbs of phosphorescent Lilith were laved. Incubi and succubae howled
   praise to Hecate, and headless moon-calves bleated to the Magna Mater.
   Goats leaped to the sound of thin accursed flutes, and AEgypans chased
   endlessly after misshapen fauns over rocks twisted like swollen toads.
   Moloch and Ashtaroth were not absent; for in this quintessence of all
   damnation the bounds of consciousness were let down, and man's fancy lay
   open to vistas of every realm of horror and every forbidden dimension that
   evil had power to mould. The world and Nature were helpless against such
   assaults from unsealed wells of night, nor could any sign or prayer check
   the Walpurgis-riot of horror which had come when a sage with the hateful
   key had stumbled on a horde with the locked and brimming coffer of
   transmitted daemon-lore.

   Suddenly a ray of physical light shot through these phantasms, and Malone
   heard the sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of things that should be
   dead. A boat with a lantern in its prow darted into sight, made fast to an
   iron ring in the slimy stone pier, and vomited forth several dark men
   bearing a long burden swathed in bedding. They took it to the naked
   phosphorescent thing on the carved golden pedestal, and the thing tittered
   and pawed at the bedding. Then they unswathed it, and propped upright
   before the pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a corpulent old man with
   stubbly beard and unkempt white hair. The phosphorescent thing tittered
   again, and the men produced bottles from their pockets and anointed its
   feet with red, whilst they afterward gave the bottles to the thing to
   drink from.

   All at once, from an arcaded avenue leading endlessly away, there came the
   daemoniac rattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ, choking and rumbling
   out the mockeries of hell in a cracked, sardonic bass. In an instant every
   moving entity was electrified; and forming at once into a ceremonial
   procession, the nightmare horde slithered away in quest of the sound -
   goat, satyr, and AEgypan, incubus, succubus and lemur, twisted toad and
   shapeless elemental, dog-faced howler and silent strutter in darkness -
   all led by the abominable naked phosphorescent thing that had squatted on
   the carved golden throne, and that now strode insolently bearing in its
   arms the glassy-eyed corpse of the corpulent old man. The strange dark men
   danced in the rear, and the whole column skipped and leaped with Dionysiac
   fury. Malone staggered after them a few steps, delirious and hazy, and
   doubtful of his place in this or in any world. Then he turned, faltered,
   and sank down on the cold damp stone, gasping and shivering as the daemon
   organ croaked on, and the howling and drumming and tinkling of the mad
   procession grew fainter and fainter.

   Vaguely he was conscious of chanted horrors and shocking croakings afar
   off. Now and then a wail or whine of ceremonial devotion would float to
   him through the black arcade, whilst eventually there rose the dreadful
   Greek incantation whose text he had read above the pulpit of that
   dance-hall church.

     'O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of
     dogs (here a hideous howl bust forth) and spilt blood (here nameless
     sounds vied with morbid shriekings) who wanderest in the midst of shades
     among the tombs, (here a whistling sigh occurred) who longest for blood
     and bringest terror to mortals, (short, sharp cries from myriad throats)
     Gorgo, (repeated as response) Mormo, (repeated with ecstasy)
     thousand-faced moon, (sighs and flute notes) look favourably on our
     sacrifices!'

   As the chant closed, a general shout went up, and hissing sounds nearly
   drowned the croaking of the cracked bass organ. Then a gasp as from many
   throats, and a babel of barked and bleated words - 'Lilith, Great Lilith,
   behold the Bridegroom!' More cries, a clamour of rioting, and the sharp,
   clicking footfalls of a running figure. The footfalls approached, and
   Malone raised himself to his elbow to look.

   The luminosity of the crypt, lately diminished, had now slightly
   increased; and in that devil-light there appeared the fleeing form of that
   which should not flee or feel or breathe - the glassy-eyed, gangrenous
   corpse of the corpulent old man, now needing no support, but animated by
   some infernal sorcery of the rite just closed. After it raced the naked,
   tittering, phosphorescent thing that belonged on the carven pedestal, and
   still farther behind panted the dark men, and all the dread crew of
   sentient loathsomenesses. The corpse was gaining on its pursuers, and
   seemed bent on a definite object, straining with every rotting muscle
   toward the carved golden pedestal, whose necromantic importance was
   evidently so great. Another moment and it had reached its goal, whilst the
   trailing throng laboured on with more frantic speed. But they were too
   late, for in one final spurt of strength which ripped tendon from tendon
   and sent its noisome bulk floundering to the floor in a state of jellyish
   dissolution, the staring corpse which had been Robert Suydam achieved its
   object and its triumph. The push had been tremendous, but the force had
   held out; and as the pusher collapsed to a muddy blotch of corruption the
   pedestal he had pushed tottered, tipped, and finally careened from its
   onyx base into the thick waters below, sending up a parting gleam of
   carven gold as it sank heavily to undreamable gulfs of lower Tartarus. In
   that instant, too, the whole scene of horror faded to nothingness before
   Malone's eyes; and he fainted amidst a thunderous crash which seemed to
   blot out all the evil universe.

                                      VII

   Malone's dream, experienced in full before he knew of Suydam's death and
   transfer at sea, was curiously supplemented by some odd realities of the
   case; though that is no reason why anyone should believe it. The three old
   houses in Parker Place, doubtless long rotten with decay in its most
   insidious form, collapsed without visible cause while half the raiders and
   most of the prisoners were inside; and of both the greater number were
   instantly killed. Only in the basements and cellars was there much saving
   of life, and Malone was lucky to have been deep below the house of Robert
   Suydam. For he really was there, as no one is disposed to deny. They found
   him unconscious by the edge of a night-black pool, with a grotesquely
   horrible jumble of decay and bone, identifiable through dental work as the
   body of Suydam, a few feet away. The case was plain, for it was hither
   that the smugglers' underground canal led; and the men who took Suydam
   from the ship had brought him home. They themselves were never found, or
   at least never identified; and the ship's doctor is not yet satisfied with
   the simple certitudes of the police.

   Suydam was evidently a leader in extensive man-smuggling operations, for
   the canal to his house was but one of several subterranean channels and
   tunnels in the neighbourhood. There was a tunnel from this house to a
   crypt beneath the dance-hall church; a crypt accessible from the church
   only through a narrow secret passage in the north wall, and in whose
   chambers some singular and terrible things were discovered. The croaking
   organ was there, as well as a vast arched chapel with wooden benches and a
   strangely figured altar. The walls were lined with small cells, in
   seventeen of which - hideous to relate - solitary prisoners in a state of
   complete idiocy were found chained, including four mothers with infants of
   disturbingly strange appearance. These infants died soon after exposure to
   the light; a circumstance which the doctors thought rather merciful.
   Nobody but Malone, among those who inspected them, remembered the sombre
   question of old Delrio: 'An sint unquam daemones incubi et succubae, et an
   ex tali congressu proles nasci queat?'

   Before the canals were filled up they were thoroughly dredged, and yielded
   forth a sensational array of sawed and split bones of all sizes. The
   kidnapping epidemic, very clearly, had been traced home; though only two
   of the surviving prisoners could by any legal thread be connected with it.
   These men are now in prison, since they failed of conviction as
   accessories in the actual murders. The carved golden pedestal or throne so
   often mentioned by Malone as of primary occult importance was never
   brought to light, though at one place under the Suydam house the canal was
   observed to sink into a well too deep for dredging. It was choked up at
   the mouth and cemented over when the cellars of the new houses were made,
   but Malone often speculates on what lies beneath. The police, satisfied
   that they had shattered a dangerous gang of maniacs and man-smugglers,
   turned over to the Federal authorities the unconvicted Kurds, who befure
   their deportation were conclusively found to belong to the Yezidi clan of
   devil-worshippers. The tramp ship and its crew remain an elusive mystery.
   though cynical detectives are once more ready to combat its smugging and
   rum-running ventures. Malone thinks these detectives shew a sadly limited
   perspective in their lack of wonder at the myriad unexplainable details,
   and the suggestive obscurity of the whole case; though he is just as
   critical of the newspapers, which saw only a morbid sensation and gloated
   over a minor sadist cult which they might have proclaimed a horror from
   the universe's very heart. But he is content to rest silent in Chepachet,
   calming his nervous system and praying that time may gradually transfer
   his terrible experience from the realm of present reality to that of
   picturesque and semi-mythical remoteness.

   Robert Suydam sleeps beside his bride in Greenwood Cemetery. No funeral
   was held over the strangely released bones, and relatives are grateful for
   the swift oblivion which overtook the case as a whole. The scholar's
   connexion with the Red Hook horrors, indeed, was never emblazoned by legal
   proof; since his death forestalled the inquiry he would otherwise have
   faced. His own end is not much mentioned, and the Suydams hope that
   posterity may recall him only as a gentle recluse who dabbled in harmless
   magic and folklore.

   As for Red Hook - it is always the same. Suydam came and went; a terror
   gathered and faded; but the evil spirit of darkness and squalor broods on
   amongst the mongrels in the old brick houses, and prowling bands still
   parade on unknown errands past windows where lights and twisted faces
   unaccountably appear and disappear. Age-old horror is a hydra with a
   thousand heads, and the cults of darkness are rooted in blasphemies deeper
   than the well of Democritus, The soul of the beast is omnipresent and
   triumphant, and Red Hook's legions of blear-eyed, pockmarked youths still
   chant and curse and howl as they file from abyss to abyss, none knows
   whence or whither, pushed on by blind laws of biology which they may never
   understand. As of old, more people enter Red Hook than leave it on the
   landward side, and there are already rumours of new canals running
   underground to certain centres of traffic in liquor and less mentionable
   things.

   The dance-hall church is now mostly a dance-hall, and queer faces have
   appeared at night at the windows. Lately a policeman expressed the belief
   that the filled-up crypt has been dug out again, and for no simply
   explainable purpose. Who are we to combat poisons older than history and
   mankind? Apes danced in Asia to those horrors, and the cancer lurks secure
   and spreading where furtiveness hides in rows of decaying brick.

   Malone does not shudder without cause - for only the other day an officer
   overheard a swarthy squinting hag teaching a small child some whispered
   patois in the shadow of an areaway. He listened, and thought it very
   strange when he heard her repeat over and over again,

     'O friend and companion of night, thou who rejoicest in the baying of
     dogs and spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of shades among the
     tombs, who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals, Gorgo,
     Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look favourably on our sacrifices!'
