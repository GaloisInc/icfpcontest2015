	<h2>The Garden</h2>
	<h3>by H. P. Lovecraft</h3>
	<table border="0">
		<tr>
			<td>
				<p>There's an ancient, ancient garden that I see sometimes in dreams,
				<br>Where the very Maytime sunlight plays and glows with spectral gleams;
				<br>Where the gaudy-tinted blossoms seem to wither into grey,
				<br>And the crumbling walls and pillars waken thoughts of yesterday.
				<br>There are vines in nooks and crannies, and there's moss about the pool,
				<br>And the tangled weedy thicket chokes the arbour dark and cool:
				<br>In the silent sunken pathways springs a herbage sparse and spare,
				<br>Where the musty scent of dead things dulls the fragrance of the air.
				<br>There is not a living creature in the lonely space arouna,
				<br>And the hedge~encompass'd d quiet never echoes to a sound.
				<br>As I walk, and wait, and listen, I will often seek to find
				<br>When it was I knew that garden in an age long left behind;
				<br>I will oft conjure a vision of a day that is no more,
				<br>As I gaze upon the grey, grey scenes I feel I knew before.
				<br>Then a sadness settles o'er me, and a tremor seems to start -
				<br>For I know the flow'rs are shrivell'd hopes - the garden is my heart.
