     Gorgons and Hydras, and Chimaeras - dire stories of Celaeno and the
     Harpies - may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition - but
     they were there before. They are transcripts, types - the archtypes are
     in us, and eternal. How else should the recital of that which we know in
     a waking sense to be false come to affect us all? Is it that we
     naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered in their
     capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury? O, least of
     all! These terrors are of older standing. They date beyond body - or
     without the body, they would have been the same... That the kind of fear
     here treated is purely spiritual - that it is strong in proportion as it
     is objectless on earth, that it predominates in the period of our
     sinless infancy - are difficulties the solution of which might afford
     some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and a peep at
     least into the shadowland of pre-existence.

                                       I.

   When a traveller in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork at
   the junction of Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean's Corners he comes upon a
   lonely and curious country.

   The ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer
   and closer against the ruts of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the
   frequent forest belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles and
   grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the
   same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the
   sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age,
   squalor, and dilapidation.

   Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled
   solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the
   sloping, rock-strewn meadows. Those figures are so silent and furtive that
   one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be
   better to have nothing to do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains
   in view above the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is
   increased. The summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of
   comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial
   clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them
   are crowned.

   Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude
   wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again
   there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and
   indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the
   fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily
   insistent rhythms of stridently piping bull-frogs. The thin, shining line
   of the Miskatonic's upper reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as
   it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises.

   As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their
   stone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that
   one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which
   to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled
   between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders
   at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier
   architectural period than that of the neighbouring region. It is not
   reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are
   deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church now
   harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One
   dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to
   avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint,
   malign odour about the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of
   centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place, and to follow
   the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country
   beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterwards one sometimes learns
   that one has been through Dunwich.

   Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season
   of horror all the signboards pointing towards it have been taken down. The
   scenery, judged by an ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly
   beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists. Two
   centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest
   presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for
   avoiding the locality. In our sensible age - since the Dunwich horror of
   1928 was hushed up by those who had the town's and the world's welfare at
   heart - people shun it without knowing exactly why. Perhaps one reason -
   though it cannot apply to uninformed strangers - is that the natives are
   now repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retrogression
   so common in many New England backwaters. They have come to form a race by
   themselves, with the well-defined mental and physical stigmata of
   degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their intelligence is woefully
   low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden
   murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnameable violence and perversity.
   The old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which
   came from Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of
   decay; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply
   that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of
   the Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and
   Miskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel
   roofs under which they and their ancestors were born.

   No one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror, can
   say just what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak of
   unhallowed rites and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they called
   forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and made wild
   orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from
   the ground below. In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the
   Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on
   the close presence of Satan and his imps; in which he said:

     "It must be allow'd, that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of
     Daemons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny'd; the cursed
     Voices of Azazel and Buzrael, of Beelzebub and Belial, being heard now
     from under Ground by above a Score of credible Witnesses now living. I
     myself did not more than a Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of
     evill Powers in the Hill behind my House; wherein there were a Rattling
     and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no Things of
     this Earth could raise up, and which must needs have come from those
     Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock".

   Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon, but the text,
   printed in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills continued to
   be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to geologists and
   physiographers.

   Other traditions tell of foul odours near the hill-crowning circles of
   stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at
   certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines; while
   still others try to explain the Devil's Hop Yard - a bleak, blasted
   hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then, too, the
   natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal
   on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait
   for the souls of the dying, and that they time their eerie cries in unison
   with the sufferer's struggling breath. If they can catch the fleeing soul
   when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in
   daemoniac laughter; but if they fail, they subside gradually into a
   disappointed silence.

   These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come
   down from very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old - older by
   far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it. South of the
   village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient
   Bishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill at
   the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture to be
   seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the nineteenth-century factory
   movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great rings of
   rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops, but these are more generally
   attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of skulls and
   bones, found within these circles and around the sizeable table-like rock
   on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the
   burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many ethnologists,
   disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory, persist in
   believing the remains Caucasian.

                                      II.

   It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited
   farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile
   and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5
   a.m. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled
   because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe under
   another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded, and all the
   dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout the night
   before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the
   decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of
   thirty-five, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the
   most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavinia
   Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region
   made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose
   ancestry the country folk might - and did - speculate as widely as they
   chose. On the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark,
   goatish-looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and
   pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about
   its unusual powers and tremendous future.

   Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone
   creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying
   to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two
   centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and
   wormholes. She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed
   scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote
   farmhouse had always been feared because of Old Whateley's reputation for
   black magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs Whateley when
   Lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular.
   Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose
   day-dreams and singular occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by
   household cares in a home from which all standards of order and
   cleanliness had long since disappeared.

   There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and
   the dogs' barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or
   midwife presided at his coming. Neighbours knew nothing of him till a week
   afterward, when Old Wateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich
   Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at Osborne's
   general store. There seemed to be a change in the old man - an added
   element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him
   from an object to a subject of fear - though he was not one to be
   perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all he showed some trace
   of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and what he said of the
   child's paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward.

   'I dun't keer what folks think - ef Lavinny's boy looked like his pa, he
   wouldn't look like nothin' ye expeck. Ye needn't think the only folks is
   the folks hereabouts. Lavinny's read some, an' has seed some things the
   most o' ye only tell abaout. I calc'late her man is as good a husban' as
   ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an' ef ye knowed as much abaout the
   hills as I dew, ye wouldn't ast no better church weddin' nor her'n. Let me
   tell ye suthin - some day yew folks'll hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin'
   its father's name on the top o' Sentinel Hill!'

   The only person who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old
   Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer's
   common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie's visit was frankly one of curiosity,
   and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah
   came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his
   son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the
   part of small Wilbur's family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich
   horror came and went; yet at no time did the ramshackle Wateley barn seem
   overcrowded with livestock. There came a period when people were curious
   enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the
   steep hillside above the old farm-house, and they could never find more
   than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some
   blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the
   diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality
   amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the
   aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or
   twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern
   similar sores about the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his
   slattemly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.

   In the spring after Wilbur's birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles
   in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child.
   Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk
   had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift development
   which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur's growth was
   indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his birth he had attained a
   size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of
   age. His motions and even his vocal sounds showed a restraint and
   deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no one was really
   unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted, with
   falterings which another month was sufficient to remove.

   It was somewhat after this time - on Hallowe'en - that a great blaze was
   seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like
   stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was
   started when Silas Bishop - of the undecayed Bishops - mentioned having
   seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an
   hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a stray heifer,
   but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures
   in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost noiselessly through
   the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were
   entirely unclothed. Afterwards he could not be sure about the boy, who may
   have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers
   on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without
   complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened
   disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm.
   His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was
   thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of
   reasons.

   The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that
   'Lavinny's black brat' had commenced to talk, and at the age of only
   eleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its
   difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it
   displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three
   or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke
   he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich
   and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even
   in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his
   intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds.
   His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he
   shared his mother's and grandfather's chinlessness, his firm and
   precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark,
   almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh
   preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his
   appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or
   animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse
   crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more
   decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him
   were spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how
   the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in
   the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before
   him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and he was always obliged to take various
   defensive measures against their barking menace.

                                      III.

   Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably
   increasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to repair
   the unused parts of his house - a spacious, peak-roofed affair whose rear
   end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose three
   least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and
   his daughter.

   There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to
   enable him to accomplish so much hard labour; and though he still babbled
   dementedly at times, his carpentry seemed to show the effects of sound
   calculation. It had already begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of
   the many tool sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and
   fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now, in restoring the abandoned upper
   storey of the house, he was a no less thorough craftsman. His mania showed
   itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed
   section - though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with
   the reclamation at all.

   Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his
   new grandson - a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever
   admitted to the closely-boarded upper storey. This chamber he lined with
   tall, firm shelving, along which he began gradually to arrange, in
   apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books
   which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of
   the various rooms.

   'I made some use of 'em,' he would say as he tried to mend a torn
   black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, 'but the
   boy's fitten to make better use of 'em. He'd orter hev 'em as well so as
   he kin, for they're goin' to be all of his larnin'.'

   When Wilbur was a year and seven months old - in September of 1914 - his
   size and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a
   child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran
   freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her
   wanderings. At home he would pore dilligently over the queer pictures and
   charts in his grandfather's books, while Old Whateley would instruct and
   catechize him through long, hushed afternoons. By this time the
   restoration of the house was finished, and those who watched it wondered
   why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door. It was
   a window in the rear of the east gable end, close against the hill; and no
   one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the
   ground. About the period of this work's completion people noticed that the
   old tool-house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur's
   birth, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when
   Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old
   Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered -
   such a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life
   except near the Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from
   anything sane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich
   folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.

   The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore
   to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On May Eve of
   1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the
   following Hallowe'en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronized
   with bursts of flame - 'them witch Whateleys' doin's' - from the summit of
   Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up uncannily, so that he looked like a
   boy of ten as he entered his fourth year. He read avidly by himself now;
   but talked much less than formerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing
   him, and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the
   dawning look of evil in his goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an
   unfamiliar jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener
   with a sense of unexplainable terror. The aversion displayed towards him
   by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to
   carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety. His
   occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the
   owners of canine guardians.

   The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground
   floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second
   storey. She would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up
   there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of
   fear when a jocose fish-pedlar tried the locked door leading to the
   stairway. That pedlar told the store loungers at Dunwich Village that he
   thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above. The loungers
   reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of the cattle that so
   swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they recalled tales of Old
   Whateley's youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the
   earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen
   gods. It had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and
   fear the whole Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young
   Wilbur personally.

   In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local
   draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even
   to be sent to development camp. The government, alarmed at such signs of
   wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and medical experts to
   investigate; conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may
   still recall. It was the publicity attending this investigation which set
   reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and
   Arkham Advertiser to print flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur's
   precociousness, Old Whateley's black magic, and the shelves of strange
   books, the sealed second storey of the ancient farmhouse, and the
   weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises. Wilbur was four and a
   half then, and looked like a lad of fifteen. His lips and cheeks were
   fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his voice had begun to break.

   Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and
   camera men, and called their attention to the queer stench which now
   seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces. It was, he said,
   exactly like a smell he had found in the toolshed abandoned when the house
   was finally repaired; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought
   he caught near the stone circle on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the
   stories when they appeared, and grinned over the obvious mistakes. They
   wondered, too, why the writers made so much of the fact that Old Whateley
   always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The
   Whateleys had received their visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though
   they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or
   refusal to talk.

                                      IV.

   For a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into the
   general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened
   to their May Eve and All-Hallows orgies. Twice a year they would light
   fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the mountain rumblings
   would recur with greater and greater violence; while at all seasons there
   were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farm-house. In the course
   of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper storey even
   when all the family were downstairs, and they wondered how swiftly or how
   lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed. There was talk of a
   complaint to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals but
   nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the
   outside world's attention to themselves.

   About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and
   bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of
   carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the sealed upper
   part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth
   and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed
   the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void between the ground storey
   and the peaked roof. They had torn down the great central chimney, too,
   and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stove-pipe.

   In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number of
   whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his
   window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great
   significance, and told the loungers at Osborn's that he thought his time
   had almost come.

   'They whistle jest in tune with my breathin' naow,' he said, 'an' I guess
   they're gittin' ready to ketch my soul. They know it's a-goin' aout, an'
   dun't calc'late to miss it. Yew'll know, boys, arter I'm gone, whether
   they git me er not. Ef they dew, they'll keep up a-singin' an' laffin'
   till break o' day. Ef they dun't they'll kinder quiet daown like. I expeck
   them an' the souls they hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles
   sometimes.'

   On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned by
   Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the
   darkness and telephoned from Osborn's in the village. He found Old
   Whateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous
   breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino daughter
   and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from the vacant
   abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging
   or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The doctor, though, was
   chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly
   limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in
   repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man. It
   was uncanny and unnatural - too much, thought Dr Houghton, like the whole
   of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent
   call.

   Towards one o'clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his
   wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson.

   'More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows - an' that grows faster.
   It'll be ready to serve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog-Sothoth
   with the long chant that ye'll find on page 751 of the complete edition,
   an' then put a match to the prison. Fire from airth can't burn it nohaow.'

   He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of
   whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some
   indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he added
   another sentence or two.

   'Feed it reg'lar, Willy, an' mind the quantity; but dun't let it grow too
   fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens
   to Yog-Sothoth, it's all over an' no use. Only them from beyont kin make
   it multiply an' work... Only them, the old uns as wants to come back...'

   But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the way the
   whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more than an hour,
   when the final throaty rattle came. Dr Houghton drew shrunken lids over
   the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to
   silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises
   rumbled faintly.

   'They didn't git him,' he muttered in his heavy bass voice.

   Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his
   one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians
   in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept. He
   was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because of certain
   youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door; but was
   always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of
   old-time gold which still, as in his grandfather's time, went forth
   regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying. He was now tremendously
   mature of aspect, and his height, having reached the normal adult limit,
   seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In 1925, when a scholarly
   correspondent from Miskatonic University called upon him one day and
   departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and three-quarters feet tall.

   Through all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino mother
   with a growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the hills with
   him on May Eve and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature complained to
   Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him.

   'They's more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,' she said,
   'an' naowadays they's more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur Gawd, I
   dun't know what he wants nor what he's a-tryin' to dew.'

   That Hallowe'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned
   on Sentinel Hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the
   rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills
   which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley farmhouse. After
   midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandemoniac cachinnation
   which filled all the countryside, and not until dawn did they finally
   quiet down. Then they vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a
   month overdue. What this meant, no one could quite be certain till later.
   None of the countryfolk seemed to have died - but poor Lavinia Whateley,
   the twisted albino, was never seen again.

   In the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began
   moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterwards Earl Sawyer told
   the loungers at Osborn's that more carpentry was going on in the Whateley
   farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground
   floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather
   had done upstairs four years before. He was living in one of the sheds,
   and Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous. People
   generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother
   disappearance, and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now. His
   height had increased to more than seven feet, and showed no signs of
   ceasing its development.

                                       V.

   The following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur's first
   trip outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener Library
   at Harvard, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the British Museum, the
   University of Buenos Ayres, and the Library of Miskatonic University at
   Arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted; so
   at length he set out in person, shabby, dirty, bearded, and uncouth of
   dialect, to consult the copy at Miskatonic, which was the nearest to him
   geographically. Almost eight feet tall, and carrying a cheap new valise
   from Osborne's general store, this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one
   day in Arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at
   the college library - the hideous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul
   Alhazred in Olaus Wormius' Latin version, as printed in Spain in the
   seventeenth century. He had never seen a city before, but had no thought
   save to find his way to the university grounds; where indeed, he passed
   heedlessly by the great white-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural
   fury and enmity, and tugged frantically at its stout chaim.

   Wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr Dee's English
   version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon receiving
   access to the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with
   the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the
   751st page of his own defective volume. This much he could not civilly
   refrain from telling the librarian - the same erudite Henry Armitage (A.M.
   Miskatonic, Ph.D. Princeton, Litt.D. Johns Hopkins) who had once called at
   the farm, and who now politely plied him with questions. He was looking,
   he had to admit, for a kind of formula or incantation containing the
   frightful name Yog-Sothoth, and it puzzled him to find discrepancies,
   duplications, and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far
   from easy. As he copied the formula he finally chose, Dr Armitage looked
   involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages; the left-hand one of
   which, in the Latin version, contained such monstrous threats to the peace
   and sanity of the world.

     Nor is it to be thought (ran the text as Armitage mentally translated
     it) that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or
     that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The Old Ones
     were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we
     know, but between them, they walk serene and primal, undimensioned and
     to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate.
     Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future,
     all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of
     old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They had
     trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can
     behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them
     near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the
     features of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there
     many sorts, differing in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that
     shape without sight or substance which is Them. They walk unseen and
     foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites
     howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and
     the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and
     crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites.
     Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The
     ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones
     whereon Their seal is engraver, but who bath seen the deep frozen city
     or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great
     Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. Ia:!
     Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your
     throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your
     guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the
     spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule
     where man rules now. After summer is winter, after winter summer. They
     wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.

   Dr. Annitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard of
   Dunwich and its brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his dim,
   hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable
   matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tomb's
   cold clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn
   of another planet or dimension; like something only partly of mankind, and
   linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan
   phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter, space and time.
   Presently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange,
   resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run of
   mankind's.

   'Mr Armitage,' he said, 'I calc'late I've got to take that book home.
   They's things in it I've got to try under sarten conditions that I can't
   git here, en' it 'ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold me up.
   Let me take it along, Sir, an' I'll swar they wun't nobody know the
   difference. I dun't need to tell ye I'll take good keer of it. It wan't me
   that put this Dee copy in the shape it is...'

   He stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian's face, and his own
   goatish features grew crafty. Armitage, half-ready to tell him he might
   make a copy of what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible
   consequences and checked himself. There was too much responsibility in
   giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres. Whateley
   saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly.

   'Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard won't be so
   fussy as yew be.' And without saying more he rose and strode out of the
   building, stooping at each doorway.

   Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied
   Whateley's gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from
   the window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and recalled the
   old Sunday stories in the Advertiser; these things, and the lore he had
   picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there.
   Unseen things not of earth - or at least not of tridimensional earth -
   rushed foetid and horrible through New England's glens, and brooded
   obscenely on the mountain tops. Of this he had long felt certain. Now he
   seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding
   horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the
   ancient and once passive nightmare. He locked away the Necronomicon with a
   shudder of disgust, but the room still reeked with an unholy and
   unidentifiable stench. 'As a foulness shall ye know them,' he quoted. Yes
   - the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the Whateley
   farmhouse less than three years before. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and
   ominous, once again, and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his
   parentage.

   'Inbreeding?' Armitage muttered half-aloud to himself. 'Great God, what
   simpletons! Show them Arthur Machen's Great God Pan and they'll think it a
   common Dunwich scandal! But what thing - what cursed shapeless influence
   on or off this three-dimensional earth - was Wilbur Whateley's father?
   Born on Candlemas - nine months after May Eve of 1912, when the talk about
   the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham - what walked on the
   mountains that May night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on the world
   in half-human flesh and blood?'

   During the ensuing weeks Dr Armitage set about to collect all possible
   data on Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He got
   in communication with Dr Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended Old
   Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the
   grandfather's last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich
   Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of the
   Necronomicon, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to
   supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and desires of the
   strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks with several
   students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many others elsewhere,
   gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of
   alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear. As the summer drew on he
   felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of
   the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known to the
   human world as Wilbur Whateley.

                                      VI.

   The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928, and
   Dr Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue. He had
   heard, meanwhile, of Whateley's grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his
   frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener
   Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage had issued
   warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the
   dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious
   for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get home again, as if he
   feared the results of being away long.

   Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small
   hours of the third Dr Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild, fierce
   cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and terrible, the
   snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always in mounting volume,
   but with hideously significant pauses. Then there rang out a scream from a
   wholly different throat - such a scream as roused half the sleepers of
   Arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterwards - such a scream as could
   come from no being born of earth, or wholly of earth.

   Armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and
   lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and
   heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library. An
   open window showed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had
   indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming, now fast
   fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from
   within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was taking place was not a
   thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed back the crowd with
   authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among the others he saw
   Professor Warren Rice and Dr Francis Morgan, men to whom he had told some
   of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two he motioned to accompany
   him inside. The inward sounds, except for a watchful, droning whine from
   the dog, had by this time quite subsided; but Armitage now perceived with
   a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had
   commenced a damnably rhythmical piping, as if in unison with the last
   breaths of a dying man.

   The building was full of a frightful stench which Dr Armitage knew too
   well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical
   reading-room whence the low whining came. For a second nobody dared to
   turn on the light, then Armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the
   switch. One of the three - it is not certain which - shrieked aloud at
   what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs.
   Professor Rice declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant,
   though he did not stumble or fall.

   The thing that lay half-bent on its side in a foetid pool of
   greenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall, and
   the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin. It was not
   quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved
   in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills
   outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel were scattered
   about the room, and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where
   it had evidently been thrown. Near the central desk a revolver had fallen,
   a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been
   fired. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the
   time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen
   could describe it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly
   visualized by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely
   bound up with the common life-forms of this planet and of the three known
   dimensions. It was partly human, beyond a doubt, with very manlike hands
   and head, and the goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateley's
   upon it. But the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically
   fabulous, so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to
   walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicated.

   Above the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where the
   dog's rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery, reticulated
   hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald with yellow and
   black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes. Below
   the waist, though, it was the worst; for here all human resemblance left
   off and sheer phantasy began. The skin was thickly covered with coarse
   black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish-grey tentacles
   with red sucking mouths protruded limply.

   Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some
   cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the hips,
   deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to be a
   rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk
   or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences of being
   an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs, save for their black fur,
   roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth's giant saurians, and
   terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were neither hooves nor claws. When
   the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed colour, as
   if from some circulatory cause normal to the non-human greenish tinge,
   whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which
   alternated with a sickly grayish-white in the spaces between the purple
   rings. Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish-yellow
   ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the
   stickiness, and left a curious discoloration behind it.

   As the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it began
   to mumble without turning or raising its head. Dr Armitage made no written
   record of its mouthings, but asserts confidently that nothing in English
   was uttered. At first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech
   of earth, but towards the last there came some disjointed fragments
   evidently taken from the Necronomicon, that monstrous blasphemy in quest
   of which the thing had perished. These fragments, as Armitage recalls
   them, ran something like 'N'gai, n'gha'ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y'hah:
   Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth ...' They trailed off into nothingness as the
   whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendos of unholy anticipation.

   Then came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised its head in a long,
   lugubrious howl. A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the
   prostrate thing, and the great black eyes fell in appallingly. Outside the
   window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and above
   the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a panic-struck
   whirring and fluttering. Against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers
   rose and raced from sight, frantic at that which they had sought for prey.

   All at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and
   leaped nervously out of the window by which it had entered. A cry rose
   from the crowd, and Dr Armitage shouted to the men outside that no one
   must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He was thankful
   that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in, and drew the
   dark curtains carefully down over each one. By this time two policemen had
   arrived; and Dr Morgan, meeting them in the vestibule, was urging them for
   their own sakes to postpone entrance to the stench-filled reading-room
   till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could be covered up.

   Meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need not
   describe the kind and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that occurred
   before the eyes of Dr Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is permissible
   to say that, aside from the external appearance of face and hands, the
   really human element in Wilbur Whateley must have been very small. When
   the medical examiner came, there was only a sticky whitish mass on the
   painted boards, and the monstrous odour had nearly disappeared. Apparently
   Whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton; at least, in any true or
   stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his unknown father.

                                      VII.

   Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror.
   Formalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details
   were duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich and
   Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the
   late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great agitation, both
   because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills, and because of
   the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping sounds which came
   increasingly from the great empty shell formed by Whateley's boarded-up
   farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle during Wilbur's
   absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The officials
   devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to
   confine their survey of the deceased's living quarters, the newly mended
   sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous report at the courthouse
   in Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in
   progress amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the
   upper Miskatonic valley.

   An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge
   ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the
   variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to those who
   found it on the old bureau which served as its owner's desk. After a week
   of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University, together with the
   deceased's collection of strange books, for study and possible
   translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely
   to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold with which Wilbur
   and Old Whateley had always paid their debts has yet been discovered.

   It was in the dark of September ninth that the horror broke loose. The
   hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked
   frantically all night. Early risers on the tenth noticed a peculiar stench
   in the air. About seven o'clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George
   Corey's, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back
   from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows. He was almost
   convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen; and in the yard
   outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully,
   having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him. Between
   gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs Corey.

   'Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis' Corey - they's suthin' ben thar!
   It smells like thunder, an' all the bushes an' little trees is pushed back
   from the rud like they'd a haouse ben moved along of it. An' that ain't
   the wust, nuther. They's prints in the rud, Mis' Corey - great raound
   prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk dawon deep like a elephant had ben
   along, only they's a sight more nor four feet could make! I looked at one
   or two afore I run, an' I see every one was covered with lines spreadin'
   aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans - twict or three times
   as big as any they is - hed of ben paounded dawon into the rud. An' the
   smell was awful, like what it is around Wizard Whateley's ol' haouse...'

   Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had
   sent him flying home. Mrs Corey, unable to extract more information, began
   telephoning the neighbours; thus starting on its rounds the overture of
   panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally Sawyer,
   housekeeper at Seth Bishop's, the nearest place to Whateley's, it became
   her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally's boy Chauncey, who
   slept poorly, had been up on the hill towards Whateley's, and had dashed
   back in terror after one look at the place, and at the pasturage where Mr
   Bishop's cows had been left out all night.

   'Yes, Mis' Corey,' came Sally's tremulous voice over the party wire,
   'Cha'ncey he just come back a-postin', and couldn't half talk fer bein'
   scairt! He says Ol' Whateley's house is all bowed up, with timbers
   scattered raound like they'd ben dynamite inside; only the bottom floor
   ain't through, but is all covered with a kind o' tar-like stuff that
   smells awful an' drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun' whar the
   side timbers is blowed away. An' they's awful kinder marks in the yard,
   tew - great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an' all sticky
   with stuff like is on the browed-up haouse. Cha'ncey he says they leads
   off into the medders, whar a great swath wider'n a barn is matted daown,
   an' all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes.

   'An' he says, says he, Mis' Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth's
   caows, frightened ez he was an' faound 'em in the upper pasture nigh the
   Devil's Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on 'em's clean gone, an' nigh
   haff o' them that's left is sucked most dry o' blood, with sores on 'em
   like they's ben on Whateleys cattle ever senct Lavinny's black brat was
   born. Seth hes gone aout naow to look at 'em, though I'll vaow he won't
   keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley's! Cha'ncey didn't look keerful ter
   see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the pasturage, but
   he says he thinks it p'inted towards the glen rud to the village.

   'I tell ye, Mis' Corey, they's suthin' abroad as hadn't orter be abroad,
   an' I for one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad end he
   deserved, is at the bottom of the breedin' of it. He wa'n't all human
   hisself, I allus says to everybody; an' I think he an' Ol' Whateley must a
   raised suthin' in that there nailed-up haouse as ain't even so human as he
   was. They's allus ben unseen things araound Dunwich - livin' things - as
   ain't human an' ain't good fer human folks.

   'The graoun' was a-talkin' las' night, an' towards mornin' Cha'ncey he
   heered the whippoorwills so laoud in Col' Spring Glen he couldn't sleep
   nun. Then he thought he heered another faint-like saound over towards
   Wizard Whateley's - a kinder rippin' or tearin' o' wood, like some big box
   er crate was bein' opened fur off. What with this an' that, he didn't git
   to sleep at all till sunup, an' no sooner was he up this mornin', but he's
   got to go over to Whateley's an' see what's the matter. He see enough I
   tell ye, Mis' Corey! This dun't mean no good, an' I think as all the
   men-folks ought to git up a party an' do suthin'. I know suthin' awful's
   abaout, an' feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is.

   'Did your Luther take accaount o' whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal,
   Mis' Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o' the glen, an' ain't
   got to your haouse yet, I calc'late they must go into the glen itself.
   They would do that. I allus says Col' Spring Glen ain't no healthy nor
   decent place. The whippoorwills an' fireflies there never did act like
   they was creaters o' Gawd, an' they's them as says ye kin hear strange
   things a-rushin' an' a-talkin' in the air dawon thar ef ye stand in the
   right place, atween the rock falls an' Bear's Den.'

   By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were
   trooping over the roads and meadows between the newmade Whateley ruins and
   Cold Spring Glen, examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the
   maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse, and the
   bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and roadside. Whatever had burst
   loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister
   ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken, and a great
   avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as
   though a house, launched by an avalanche, had slid down through the
   tangled growths of the almost vertical slope. From below no sound came,
   but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it is not to be wondered at
   that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue, rather than descend
   and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in its lair. Three dogs that were
   with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed and
   reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the Aylesbury
   Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no
   more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterwards
   reproduced by the Associated Press.

   That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as
   stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in
   open pasturage. About two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage
   barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye's, on the eastern
   edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a sort of
   muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs Frye
   proposed telephoning the neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the
   noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations. It came,
   apparently, from the barn; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming
   and stamping amongst the cattle. The dogs slavered and crouched close to
   the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of
   habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The
   children and the women-folk whimpered, kept from screaming by some
   obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives
   depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful
   moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes,
   huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last
   echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal
   moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of the late whippoorwills
   in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news
   she could of the second phase of the horror.

   The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed,
   uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had
   occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the
   Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and
   one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only
   a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious
   fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested
   that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it
   would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about
   halfway between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions
   about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line
   where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great
   stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his
   grandfather.

   Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize for real
   defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and
   watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a
   repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile,
   ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily
   about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the
   day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly
   as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed an offensive
   expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual
   example to the still reluctant majority.

   When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less
   huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth
   Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and
   stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of
   the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the
   sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously
   stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation of the tracks
   seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the moving mountain had
   come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along the same path. At the
   base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led
   steeply upwards, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most
   perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the
   horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete
   verticality; and as the investigators climbed round to the hill's summit
   by safer routes they saw that the trail ended - or rather, reversed -
   there.

   It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant
   their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May Eve and Hallowmass.
   Now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by
   the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a
   thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the
   floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked
   at one another and muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently
   the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent.
   To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation
   stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who was not with the group, could have
   done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation.

   Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The
   whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that
   many could not sleep, and about 3 A.M. all the party telephones rang
   tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice
   shriek out, 'Help, oh, my Gawd! ...' and some thought a crashing sound
   followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No
   one dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came.
   Then those who had heard it called everyone on the line, and found that
   only the Fryes did not reply. The truth appeared an hour later, when a
   hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the
   head of the glen. It was horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more
   swaths and monstrous prints, but there was no longer any house. It had
   caved in like an egg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead
   could be discovered. Only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes
   had been erased from Dunwich.

                                     VIII.

   In the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the
   horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a
   shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of
   Wilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation had
   caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in language both
   ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general
   resemblance to the heavily-shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being
   absolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of the
   linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving the
   effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic
   solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of
   every tongue the writer might conceivably have used. The ancient books
   taken from Whateley's quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in
   several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research
   among philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in
   this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another
   unknown alphabet - this one of a very different cast, and resembling
   Sanskrit more than anything else. The old ledger was at length given
   wholly into the charge of Dr Armitage, both because of his peculiar
   interest in the Whateley matter, and because of his wide linguistic
   learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the middle
   ages.

   Armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically
   used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times, and
   which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the
   Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not deem vital; since it
   would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if, as he
   suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It was his
   belief that, considering the great amount of text involved, the writer
   would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his
   own, save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations.
   Accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption
   that the bulk of it was in English.

   Dr Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that the
   riddle was a deep and complex one; and that no simple mode of solution
   could merit even a trial. All through late August he fortified himself
   with the mass lore of cryptography; drawing upon the fullest resources of
   his own library, and wading night after night amidst the arcana of
   Trithemius' Poligraphia, Giambattista Porta's De Furtivis Literarum Notis,
   De Vigenere's Traite des Chiffres, Falconer's Cryptomenysis Patefacta,
   Davys' and Thicknesse's eighteenth-century treatises, and such fairly
   modern authorities as Blair, van Marten and Kluber's script itself, and in
   time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and
   most ingenious of cryptograms, in which many separate lists of
   corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table, and the
   message built up with arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The
   older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and
   Armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great
   antiquity, no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical
   experimenters. Several times he seemed near daylight, only to be set back
   by some unforeseen obstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds
   began to clear. Certain letters, as used in certain parts of the
   manuscript, emerged definitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious
   that the text was indeed in English.

   On the evening of September second the last major barrier gave way, and Dr
   Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur Whateley's
   annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and it was couched in
   a style clearly showing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy
   of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the first long passage that
   Armitage deciphered, an entry dated November 26, 1916, proved highly
   startling and disquieting. It was written,he remembered, by a child of
   three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteen.

     Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth (it ran), which did not like, it
     being answerable from the hill and not from the air. That upstairs more
     ahead of me than I had thought it would be, and is not like to have much
     earth brain. Shot Elam Hutchins's collie Jack when he went to bite me,
     and Elam says he would kill me if he dast. I guess he won't. Grandfather
     kept me saying the Dho formula last night, and I think I saw the inner
     city at the 2 magnetic poles. I shall go to those poles when the earth
     is cleared off, if I can't break through with the Dho-Hna formula when I
     commit it. They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be years
     before I can clear off the earth, and I guess grandfather will be dead
     then, so I shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the
     formulas between the Yr and the Nhhngr. They from outside will help, but
     they cannot take body without human blood. That upstairs looks it will
     have the right cast. I can see it a little when I make the Voorish sign
     or blow the powder of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it is near like them at May
     Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear off some. I wonder how I shall
     look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it. He
     that came with the Aklo Sabaoth said I may be transfigured there being
     much of outside to work on.

   Morning found Dr Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of
   wakeful concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but sat
   at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking
   hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He had nervously
   telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she brought him a
   breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful. All that
   day he read on, now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the
   complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner were brought him, but he
   ate only the smallest fraction of either. Toward the middle of the next
   night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a tangle of
   nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man's existence
   that he had uncovered.

   On the morning of September fourth Professor Rice and Dr Morgan insisted
   on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and ashen-grey. That
   evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully. Wednesday - the next day
   - he was back at the manuscript, and began to take copious notes both from
   the current sections and from those he had already deciphered. In the
   small hours of that night he slept a little in a easy chair in his office,
   but was at the manuscript again before dawn. Some time before noon his
   physician, Dr Hartwell, called to see him and insisted that he cease work.
   He refused; intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to
   complete the reading of the diary and promising an explanation in due
   course of time. That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his
   terrible perusal and sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner,
   found him in a half-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn
   her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he
   had taken. Weakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed
   them all in a great envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside
   coat pocket. He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in
   need of medical aid that Dr Hartwell was summoned at once. As the doctor
   put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, 'But what, in
   God's name, can we do?'

   Dr Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made no
   explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the
   imperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder
   wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that
   something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references
   to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal
   and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings
   from another dimension. He would shout that the world was in danger, since
   the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system
   and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which
   it had once fallen, vigintillions of aeons ago. At other times he would
   call for the dreaded Necronomicon and the Daemonolatreia of Remigius, in
   which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he
   conjured up.

   'Stop them, stop theml' he would shout. 'Those Whateleys meant to let them
   in, and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do
   something - it's a blind business, but I know how to make the powder... It
   hasn't been fed since the second of August, when Wilbur came here to his
   death, and at that rate...'

   But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and
   slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He
   woke late Friday, clear of head, though sober with a gnawing fear and
   tremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to go
   over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and the
   rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the
   wildest speculation and the most desperate debate. Strange and terrible
   books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure
   places of storage; and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish
   haste and in bewildering abundance. Of scepticism there was none. All
   three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the floor in a
   room of that very building, and after that not one of them could feel even
   slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman's raving.

   Opinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police, and
   the negative finally won. There were things involved which simply could
   not be believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was made
   clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the
   conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all day
   Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained
   from the college laboratory. The more he reflected on the hellish diary,
   the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in
   stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had left behind him - the
   earth threatening entity which, unknown to him, was to burst forth in a
   few hours and become the memorable Dunwich horror.

   Monday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr Armitage, for the task in hand
   required an infinity of research and experiment. Further consultations of
   the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan, and he knew
   that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain. By Tuesday
   he had a definite line of action mapped out, and believed he would try a
   trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came.
   Tucked obscurely away in a corner of the Arkham Advertiser was a facetious
   little item from the Associated Press, telling what a record-breaking
   monster the bootleg whisky of Dunwich had raised up. Armitage, half
   stunned, could only telephone for Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they
   discussed, and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of
   them all. Armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw
   that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling
   which others had done before him.

                                      IX.

   Friday morning Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich,
   arriving at the village about one in the afternoon. The day was pleasant,
   but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent
   seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy
   ravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain top a gaunt
   circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the air of hushed
   fright at Osborn's store they knew something hideous had happened, and
   soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye house and family.
   Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich, questioning the
   natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing for themselves with
   rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their lingering traces of
   the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard, the wounded
   Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in
   various places. The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of
   almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister
   altar-like stone on the summit.

   At length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had come
   from Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of
   the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as
   far as practicable. This, however, they found more easily planned than
   performed; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction.
   There had been five of them in a car, but now the car stood empty near the
   ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all of whom had talked with the
   policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as Armitage and his companions.
   Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something and turned pale, nudging Fred
   Farr and pointing to the dank, deep hollow that yawned close by.

   'Gawd,' he gasped, 'I telled 'em not ter go daown into the glen, an' I
   never thought nobody'd dew it with them tracks an' that smell an' the
   whippoorwills a-screechin' daown thar in the dark o' noonday...'

   A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear
   seemed strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening. Armitage,
   now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work,
   trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his. Night would soon fall,
   and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch
   course. Negotium perambuians in tenebris... The old librarian rehearsed
   the formulae he had memorized, and clutched the paper containing the
   alternative one he had not memorized. He saw that his electric flashlight
   was in working order. Rice, beside him, took from a valise a metal sprayer
   of the sort used in combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game
   rifle on which he relied despite his colleague's warnings that no material
   weapon would be of help.

   Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind of
   a manifestation to expect; but he did not add to the fright of the Dunwich
   people by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might be conquered
   without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped.
   As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced to disperse homeward,
   anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all
   human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees
   and crush houses when it chose. They shook their heads at the visitors'
   plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near the glen; and, as they left,
   had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again.

   There were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills
   piped threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold
   Spring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night
   air; such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before,
   when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and
   a half as a human being. But the looked-for terror did not appear.
   Whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time, and Armitage told
   his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the dark.

   Morning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a grey, bleak day,
   with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed
   to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the north-west. The men
   from Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking shelter from the increasing
   rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed Frye outbuildings, they
   debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down
   into the glen in quest of their nameless, monstrous quarry. The downpour
   waxed in heaviness, and distant peals of thunder sounded from far
   horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, and then a forky bolt flashed near at
   hand, as if descending into the accursed glen itself. The sky grew very
   dark, and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short, sharp one
   followed by clear weather.

   It was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a confused
   babel of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought to view a
   frightened group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting, and even
   whimpering hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out words, and
   the Arkham men started violently when those words developed a coherent
   form.

   'Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd,' the voice choked out. 'It's a-goin' agin, an' this
   time by day! It's aout - it's aout an' a-movin' this very minute, an' only
   the Lord knows when it'll be on us all!'

   The speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.

   'Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heered the 'phone a-ringin', an' it
   was Mis' Corey, George's wife, that lives daown by the junction. She says
   the hired boy Luther was aout drivin' in the caows from the storm arter
   the big bolt, when he see all the trees a-bendin' at the maouth o' the
   glen - opposite side ter this - an' smelt the same awful smell like he
   smelt when he faound the big tracks las' Monday mornin'. An' she says he
   says they was a swishin' lappin' saound, more nor what the bendin' trees
   an' bushes could make, an' all on a suddent the trees along the rud begun
   ter git pushed one side, an' they was a awful stompin' an' splashin' in
   the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn't see nothin' at all, only just the
   bendin' trees an' underbrush.

   'Then fur ahead where Bishop's Brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful
   creakin' an' strainin' on the bridge, an' says he could tell the saound o'
   wood a-startin' to crack an' split. An' all the whiles he never see a
   thing, only them trees an' bushes a-bendin'. An' when the swishin' saound
   got very fur off - on the rud towards Wizard Whateley's an' Sentinel Hill
   - Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he'd heerd it fust an' look at
   the graound. It was all mud an' water, an' the sky was dark, an' the rain
   was wipin' aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be; but beginnin' at
   the glen maouth, whar the trees hed moved, they was still some o' them
   awful prints big as bar'ls like he seen Monday.'

   At this point the first excited speaker interrupted.

   'But that ain't the trouble naow - that was only the start. Zeb here was
   callin' folks up an' everybody was a-listenin' in when a call from Seth
   Bishop's cut in. His haousekeeper Sally was carryin' on fit to kill -
   she'd jest seed the trees a-bendin' beside the rud, an' says they was a
   kind o' mushy saound, like a elephant puffin' an' treadin', a-headin' fer
   the haouse. Then she up an' spoke suddent of a fearful smell, an' says her
   boy Cha'ncey was a-screamin' as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to
   the Whateley rewins Monday mornin'. An' the dogs was barkin' an' whinin'
   awful.

   'An' then she let aout a turrible yell, an' says the shed daown the rud
   had jest caved in like the storm bed blowed it over, only the wind w'an't
   strong enough to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin', an' we could hear
   lots o' folks on the wire a-gaspin'. All to onct Sally she yelled again,
   an' says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up, though they
   wa'n't no sign o' what done it. Then everybody on the line could hear
   Cha'ncey an' old Seth Bishop a-yellin' tew, an' Sally was shriekin' aout
   that suthin' heavy hed struck the haouse - not lightnin' nor nothin', but
   suthin' heavy again' the front, that kep' a-launchin' itself agin an'
   agin, though ye couldn't see nothin' aout the front winders. An' then...
   an' then...'

   Lines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was,
   had barely poise enough to prompt the speaker.

   'An' then.... Sally she yelled aout, "O help, the haouse is a-cavin' in...
   an' on the wire we could hear a turrible crashin' an' a hull flock o'
   screaming... jes like when Elmer Frye's place was took, only wuss...'

   The man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.

   'That's all - not a saound nor squeak over the 'phone arter that. Jest
   still-like. We that heerd it got aout Fords an' wagons an' rounded up as
   many able-bodied men-folks as we could git, at Corey's place, an' come up
   here ter see what yew thought best ter dew. Not but what I think it's the
   Lord's jedgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin ever set aside.'

   Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke
   decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics.

   'We must follow it, boys.' He made his voice as reassuring as possible. 'I
   believe there's a chance of putting it out of business. You men know that
   those Whateleys were wizards - well, this thing is a thing of wizardry,
   and must be put down by the same means. I've seen Wilbur Whateley's diary
   and read some of the strange old books he used to read; and I think I know
   the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away. Of course,
   one can't be sure, but we can always take a chance. It's invisible - I
   knew it would be - but there's powder in this long-distance sprayer that
   might make it show up for a second. Later on we'll try it. It's a
   frightful thing to have alive, but it isn't as bad as what Wilbur would
   have let in if he'd lived longer. You'll never know what the world
   escaped. Now we've only this one thing to fight, and it can't multiply. It
   can, though, do a lot of harm; so we mustn't hesitate to rid the community
   of it.

   'We must follow it - and the way to begin is to go to the place that has
   just been wrecked. Let somebody lead the way - I don't know your roads
   very well, but I've an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots. How
   about it?'

   The men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly,
   pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain.

   'I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop's quickest by cuttin' across the lower
   medder here, wadin' the brook at the low place, an' climbin' through
   Carrier's mowin' an' the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on the upper
   rud mighty nigh Seth's - a leetle t'other side.'

   Armitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction
   indicated; and most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing
   lighter, and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When
   Armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him and
   walked ahead to show the right one. Courage and confidence were mounting,
   though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay
   towards the end of their short cut, and among whose fantastic ancient
   trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, put these qualities to a
   severe test.

   At length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out. They
   were a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and hideously
   unmistakable tracks showed what had passed by. Only a few moments were
   consumed in surveying the ruins just round the bend. It was the Frye
   incident all over again, and nothing dead or living was found in either of
   the collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house and barn. No one
   cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness, but all
   turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on towards the
   wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned slopes of Sentinel Hill.

   As the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley's abode they shuddered
   visibly, and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was no joke
   tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see, but that
   had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon. Opposite the base of Sentinel
   Hill the tracks left the road, and there was a fresh bending and matting
   visible along the broad swath marking the monster's former route to and
   from the summit.

   Armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the
   steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to Morgan,
   whose sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried out sharply,
   passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the
   slope with his finger. Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users of optical
   devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focused the lenses with
   Armitage's aid. When he did so his cry was less restrained than Morgan's
   had been.

   'Gawd almighty, the grass an' bushes is a'movin'! It's a-goin' up -
   slow-like - creepin' - up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows what
   fur!'

   Then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one
   thing to chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it. Spells
   might be all right - but suppose they weren't? Voices began questioning
   Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply seemed quite to
   satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of
   Nature and of being utterly forbidden and wholly outside the sane
   experience of mankind.

                                       X.

   In the end the three men from Arkham - old, white-bearded Dr Armitage,
   stocky, iron-grey Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr Morgan, ascended
   the mountain alone. After much patient instruction regarding its focusing
   and use, they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained
   in the road; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among
   whom the glass was passed round. It was hard going, and Armitage had to be
   helped more than once. High above the toiling group the great swath
   trembled as its hellish maker repassed with snail-like deliberateness.
   Then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining.

   Curtis Whateley - of the undecayed branch - was holding the telescope when
   the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the crowd that
   the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which
   overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery
   was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were seen
   to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible
   blasphemy had passed it.

   Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was
   adjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about to
   happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that his sprayer was
   expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three
   men shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope and
   strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the party's
   point of advantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent chance of
   spreading the potent powder with marvellous effect.

   Those without the telescope saw only an instant's flash of grey cloud - a
   cloud about the size of a moderately large building - near the top of the
   mountain. Curtis, who held the instrument, dropped it with a piercing
   shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled, and would have
   crumbled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied
   him. All he could do was moan half-inaudibly.

   'Oh, oh, great Gawd... that... that...'

   There was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought to
   rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was past all
   coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for him.

   'Bigger'n a barn... all made o' squirmin' ropes... hull thing sort o'
   shaped like a hen's egg bigger'n anything with dozens o' legs like
   hogs-heads that haff shut up when they step... nothin' solid abaout it -
   all like jelly, an' made o' sep'rit wrigglin' ropes pushed clost
   together... great bulgin' eyes all over it... ten or twenty maouths or
   trunks a-stickin' aout all along the sides, big as stove-pipes an all
   a-tossin' an openin' an' shuttin'... all grey, with kinder blue or purple
   rings... an' Gawd it Heaven - that haff face on top...'

   This final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis; and
   he collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and Will
   Hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass. Henry
   Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see
   what he might. Through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures,
   apparently running towards the summit as fast as the steep incline
   allowed. Only these - nothing more. Then everyone noticed a strangely
   unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind, and even in the underbrush
   of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of unnumbered whippoorwills,
   and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil
   expectancy.

   Earl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as
   standing on the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone but at
   a considerable distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed to be raising
   its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals; and as Sawyer mentioned
   the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint, half-musical sound from
   the distance, as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures. The weird
   silhouette on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite
   grotesqueness and impressiveness, but no observer was in a mood for
   aesthetic appreciation. 'I guess he's sayin' the spell,' whispered Wheeler
   as he snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were piping wildly,
   and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the
   visible ritual.

   Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any
   discernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly
   marked by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed
   strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky.
   Lightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the
   portents of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became
   unmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising
   their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some farmhouse far away came
   the frantic barking of dogs.

   The change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd gazed
   about the horizon in wonder. A purplish darkness, born of nothing more
   than a spectral deepening of the sky's blue, pressed down upon the
   rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat brighter than
   before, and the crowd fancied that it had showed a certain mistiness
   around the altar-stone on the distant height. No one, however, had been
   using the telescope at that instant. The whippoorwills continued their
   irregular pulsation, and the men of Dunwich braced themselves tensely
   against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed
   surcharged.

   Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which will
   never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not from any
   human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield no such
   acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they came from the pit
   itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the altar-stone on the
   peak. It is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all, since so much of
   their ghastly, infra-bass timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and
   terror far subtler than the ear; yet one must do so, since their form was
   indisputably though vaguely that of half-articulate words. They were loud
   - loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed - yet did
   they come from no visible being. And because imagination might suggest a
   conjectural source in the world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd
   at the mountain's base huddled still closer, and winced as if in
   expectation of a blow.

   'Ygnailh... ygnaiih... thflthkh'ngha.... Yog-Sothoth ...' rang the hideous
   croaking out of space. 'Y'bthnk... h'ehye - n'grkdl'lh...'

   The speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful psychic
   struggle were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at the telescope,
   but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak,
   all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation
   drew near its culmination. From what black wells of Acherontic fear or
   feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of extra-cosmic consciousness or
   obscure, long-latent heredity, were those half-articulate
   thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather renewed force and
   coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate frenzy.

   'Eh-y-ya-ya-yahaah - e'yayayaaaa... ngh'aaaaa... ngh'aaa... h'yuh...
   h'yuh... HELP! HELP! ...ff - ff - ff - FATHER! FATHER! YOG-SOTHOTH!...'

   But that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at the
   indisputably English syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously
   down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking altar-stone, were never
   to hear such syllables again. Instead, they jumped violently at the
   terrific report which seemed to rend the hills; the deafening, cataclysmic
   peal whose source, be it inner earth or sky, no hearer was ever able to
   place. A single lightning bolt shot from the purple zenith to the
   altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable
   stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside. Trees, grass, and
   under-brush were whipped into a fury; and the frightened crowd at the
   mountain's base, weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to
   asphyxiate them, were almost hurled off their feet. Dogs howled from the
   distance, green grass and foliage wilted to a curious, sickly yellow-grey,
   and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.

   The stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again. To
   this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and
   around that fearsome hill Curtis Whateley was only just regaining
   consciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the
   beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave and
   quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible
   than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed
   quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads
   and reaffirmed one vital fact.

   'The thing has gone for ever,' Armitage said. 'It has been split up into
   what it was originally made of, and can never exist again. It was an
   impossibility in a normal world. Only the least fraction was really matter
   in any sense we know. It was like its father - and most of it has gone
   back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material
   universe; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of
   human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills.'

   There was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor
   Curtis Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he
   put his hands to his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick itself up
   where it had left off, and the horror of the sight that had prostrated him
   burst in upon him again.

   'Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face - that haff face on top of it... that
   face with the red eyes an' crinkly albino hair, an' no chin, like the
   Whateleys... It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o' thing, but they
   was a haff-shaped man's face on top of it, an' it looked like Wizard
   Whateley's, only it was yards an' yards acrost....'

   He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a
   bewilderment not quite crystallized into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon
   Whateley, who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been
   silent heretofore, spoke aloud.

   'Fifteen year' gone,' he rambled, 'I heered Ol' Whateley say as haow some
   day we'd hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top
   o' Sentinel Hill...'

   But Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.

   'What was it, anyhaow, an' haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it aout
   o' the air it come from?'

   Armitage chose his words very carefully.

   'It was - well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn't belong in our
   part of space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by
   other laws than those of our sort of Nature. We have no business calling
   in such things from outside, and only very wicked people and very wicked
   cults ever try to. There was some of it in Wilbur Whateley himself -
   enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him, and to make his
   passing out a pretty terrible sight. I'm going to burn his accursed diary,
   and if you men are wise you'll dynamite that altar-stone up there, and
   pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills. Things like
   that brought down the beings those Whateleys were so fond of - the beings
   they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the
   earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose.

   'But as to this thing we've just sent back - the Whateleys raised it for a
   terrible part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big from
   the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and big - but it beat him because it
   had a greater share of the outsideness in it. You needn't ask how Wilbur
   called it out of the air. He didn't call it out. It was his twin brother,
   but it looked more like the father than he did.'
