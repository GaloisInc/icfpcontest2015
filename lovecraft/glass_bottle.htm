</center>
<p>"Heave to, there's something floating to the leeward"&nbsp;&nbsp;the speaker was a short stockily built man whose name was William Jones. he was the captain of a small cat boat in which he & a party of men were sailing at the time the story opens.
<p>"Aye aye sir" answered John Towers & the boat was brought to a stand still&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Jones reached out his hand for the object which he now discerned to be a glass bottle&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing but a rum flask that the men on a passing boat threw over" he said but from an impulse of curiosity he reached out for it. it was a rum flask & he was about to throw it away when he noticed a piece of paper in it. He pulled it out & on it read the following
<blockquote>
	<p>Jan 1 1864
	<p>I am John Jones who writes this letter&nbsp;&nbsp;my ship is fast sinking with a treasure on board&nbsp;&nbsp;I am where it is marked * on the enclosed chart
	<p align="center"><img src="/lovecraft/graphics/glassbottle.gif" alt="Map">
</blockquote>
<p>Captain Jones turned the sheet over & the other side was a chart on the edge were written these words
<blockquote>
	<p>dotted lines represent course we took
</blockquote>
<p>"Towers" Said Capt. Jones exitedly "read this"&nbsp;&nbsp;Towers did as he was directed&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it would pay to go" said Capt. Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;"do you"?&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just as you say" replied Towers. "We'll charter a schooner this very day" said the exited captain&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right" said Towers&nbsp;&nbsp;so they hired a boat and started off govnd by the dotted lines of they chart&nbsp;&nbsp;in 4 weeks the reached the place where directed & the divers went down and came up with an iron bottle&nbsp;&nbsp;they found in it the following lines scribbled on a piece of brown paper
<blockquote>
	<p>Dec 3 1880
	<p>Dear Searcher&nbsp;&nbsp;excuse me for the practical joke I have played on you but it serves you right to find nothing for your foolish act&#8212;
</blockquote>
<p>"Well it does" said Capt Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;"go on"
<blockquote>
	<p>However I will defray your expenses to & from the place you found your bottle&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will be $25.0.00 so that amount you will find in an Iron box&nbsp;&nbsp;I know where you found the bottle because I put this bottle here & the iron box & then found a good place to put the second bottle&nbsp;&nbsp;hoping the enclosed money will defray your expenses some I close&#8212Anonymus"
</blockquote>
<p>"I'd like to kick his head off" said Capt Jones&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here diver go & get the $25.0.00&nbsp;&nbsp;in a minute the diver came up bearing an iron box&nbsp;&nbsp;in side it was found $25.0.00&nbsp;&nbsp;It defrayed their expenses but I hardly think that they will ever go to a mysterious place as directed by a mysterious bottle.
