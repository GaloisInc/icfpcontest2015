				<p>Through the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the wan-mooned abysses of night,
				<br>I have lived o'er my lives without number,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sounded all things with my sight;
				<br>And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright.

				<p>I have whirled with the earth at the dawning,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky was a vaporous flame;
				<br>I have seen the dark universe yawning
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the black planets roll without aim,
				<br>Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge or lustre or name.

				<p>I had drifted o'er seas without ending,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under sinister grey-clouded skies,
				<br>That the many-forked lightning is rending,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That resound with hysterical cries;
				<br>With the moans of invisible daemons, that out of the green waters rise.

				<p>I have plunged like a deer through the arches
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the hoary primoridal grove,
				<br>Where the oaks feel the presence that marches,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stalks on where no spirit dares rove,
				<br>And I flee from a thing that surrounds me, and leers through dead branches above.

				<p>I have stumbled by cave-ridden mountains
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rise barren and bleak from the plain,
				<br>I have drunk of the fog-foetid fountains
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ooze down to the marsh and the main;
				<br>And in hot cursed tarns I have seen things, I care not to gaze on again.

				<p>I have scanned the vast ivy-clad palace,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have trod its untenanted hall,
				<br>Where the moon rising up from the valleys
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows the tapestried things on the wall;
				<br>Strange figures discordantly woven, that I cannot endure to recall.

				<p>I have peered from the casements in wonder
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the mouldering meadows around,
				<br>At the many-roofed village laid under
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse of a grave-girdled ground;
				<br>And from rows of white urn-carven marble, I listen intently for sound.

				<p>I have haunted the tombs of the ages,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have flown on the pinions of fear,
				<br>Where the smoke-belching Erebus rages;
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the jokulls loom snow-clad and drear:
				<br>And in realms where the sun of the desert consumes what it never can cheer.

				<p>I was old when the pharaohs first mounted
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jewel-decked throne by the Nile;
				<br>I was old in those epochs uncounted
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I, and I only, was vile;
				<br>And Man, yet untainted and happy, dwelt in bliss on the far Arctic isle.

				<p>Oh, great was the sin of my spirit,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And great is the reach of its doom;
				<br>Not the pity of Heaven can cheer it,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor can respite be found in the tomb:
				<br>Down the infinite aeons come beating the wings of unmerciful gloom.

				<p>Through the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the wan-mooned abysses of night,
				<br>I have lived o'er my lives without number,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sounded all things with my sight;
				<br>And I struggle and shriek ere the daybreak, being driven to madness with fright.
