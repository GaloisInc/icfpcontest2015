   I was shown into the attic chamber by a grave, intelligent-looking man
   with quiet clothes and an iron-gray beard, who spoke to me in this
   fashion:

   "Yes, he lived here - but I don't advise your doing anything. Your
   curiosity makes you irresponsible. We never come here at night, and it's
   only because of his will that we keep it this way. You know what he did.
   That abominable society took charge at last, and we don't know where he is
   buried. There was no way the law or anything else could reach the society.

   "I hope you won't stay till after dark. And I beg of you to let that thing
   on the table - the thing that looks like a match-box - alone. We don't
   know what it is, but we suspect it has something to do with what he did.
   We even avoid looking at it very steadily."

   After a time the man left me alone in the attic room. It was very dingy
   and dusty, and only primitively furnished, but it had a neatness which
   showed it was not a slum-denizen's quarters. There were shelves full of
   theological and classical books, and another bookcase containing treatises
   on magic - Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus, Trithemius, Hermes Trismegistus,
   Borellus, and others in a strange alphabet whose titles I could not
   decipher. The furniture was very plain. There was a door, but it led only
   into a closet. The only egress was the aperture in the floor up to which
   the crude, steep staircase led. The windows were of bull's-eye pattern,
   and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity. Plainly, this
   house was of the Old World. I seemed to know where I was, but cannot
   recall what I then knew. Certainly the town was not London. My impression
   is of a small seaport.

   The small object on the table fascinated me intensely. I seemed to know
   what to do with it, for I drew a pocket electric light - or what looked
   like one - out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes. The light
   was not white but violet, and seemed less like true light than like some
   radioactive bombardment. I recall that I did not regard it as a common
   flashlight - indeed, I had a common flashlight in another pocket.

   It was getting dark, and the ancient roofs and chimney-pots outside looked
   very queer through the bull's-eye window-panes. Finally I summoned up
   courage and propped the small object up on the table against a book - then
   turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it. The light seemed now
   to be more like a rain of hail or small violet particles than like a
   continuous beam. As the particles struck the glassy surface at the center
   of the strange device, they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the
   sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are passed. The dark
   glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow, and a vague white shape seemed to
   be taking form at its center. Then I noticed that I was not alone in the
   room - and put the ray-projector back in my pocket.

   But the newcomer did not speak - nor did I hear any sound whatever during
   all the immediately following moments. Everything was shadowy pantomime,
   as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening haze - although on
   the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers loomed large and
   close, as if both near and distant, according to some abnormal geometry.

   The newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical
   garb of the Anglican church. He was apparently about thirty years old,
   with a sallow, olive complexion and fairly good features, but an
   abnormally high forehead. His black hair was well cut and neatly brushed,
   and he was clean-shaven though blue-chinned with a heavy growth of beard.
   He wore rimless spectacles with steel bows. His build and lower facial
   features were like other clergymen I had seen, but he had a vastly higher
   forehead, and was darker and more intelligent-looking - also more subtly
   and concealedly evil-looking. At the present moment - having just lighted
   a faint oil lamp - he looked nervous, and before I knew it he was casting
   all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room
   (where the wall slanted sharply) which I had not noticed before. The
   flames devoured the volumes greedily - leaping up in strange colors and
   emitting indescribably hideous odors as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves
   and wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element. All at once I saw
   there were others in the room - grave-looking men in clerical costume, one
   of whom wore the bands and knee-breeches of a bishop. Though I could hear
   nothing, I could see that they were bringing a decision of vast import to
   the first-comer. They seemed to hate and fear him at the same time, and he
   seemed to return these sentiments. His face set itself into a grim
   expression, but I could see his right hand shaking as he tried to grip the
   back of a chair. The bishop pointed to the empty case and to the fireplace
   (where the flames had died down amidst a charred, non-committal mass), and
   seemed filled with a peculiar loathing. The first-comer then gave a wry
   smile and reached out with his left hand toward the small object on the
   table. Everyone then seemed frightened. The procession of clerics began
   filing down the steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor, turning
   and making menacing gestures as they left. The bishop was last to go.

   The first-comer now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and
   extracted a coil of rope. Mounting a chair, he attached one end of the
   rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak, and began
   making a noose with the other end. Realizing he was about to hang himself,
   I started forward to dissuade or save him. He saw me and ceased his
   preparations, looking at me with a kind of triumph which puzzled and
   disturbed me. He slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding
   toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark, thin-lipped face.

   I felt somehow in deadly peril, and drew out the peculiar ray-projector as
   a weapon of defense. Why I thought it could help me, I do not know. I
   turned it on - full in his face, and saw the sallow features glow first
   with violet and then with pinkish light. His expression of wolfish
   exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear - which
   did not, however, wholly displace the exultation. He stopped in his tracks
   - then, flailing his arms wildly in the air, began to stagger backwards. I
   saw he was edging toward the open stair-well in the floor, and tried to
   shout a warning, but he did not hear me. In another instant he had lurched
   backward through the opening and was lost to view.

   I found difficulty in moving toward the stair-well, but when I did get
   there I found no crushed body on the floor below. Instead there was a
   clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal
   silence had broken, and I once more heard sounds and saw figures as
   normally tri-dimensional. Something had evidently drawn a crowd to this
   place. Had there been a noise I had not heard?

   Presently the two people (simple villagers, apparently) farthest in the
   lead saw me - and stood paralyzed. One of them shrieked loudly and
   reverberantly:

   "Ahrrh! ... It be'ee, zur? Again?"

   Then they all turned and fled frantically. All, that is, but one. When the
   crowd was gone I saw the grave-bearded man who had brought me to this
   place - standing alone with a lantern. He was gazing at me gaspingly and
   fascinatedly, but did not seem afraid. Then he began to ascend the stairs,
   and joined me in the attic. He spoke:

   "So you didn't let it alone! I'm sorry. I know what has happened. It
   happened once before, but the man got frightened and shot himself. You
   ought not to have made him come back. You know what he wants. But you
   mustn't get frightened like the other man he got. Something very strange
   and terrible has happened to you, but it didn't get far enough to hurt
   your mind and personality. If you'll keep cool, and accept the need for
   making certain radical readjustments in your life, you can keep right on
   enjoying the world, and the fruits of your scholarship. But you can't live
   here - and I don't think you'll wish to go back to London. I'd advise
   America.

   "You mustn't try anything more with that - thing. Nothing can be put back
   now. It would only make matters worse to do - or summon - anything. You
   are not as badly off as you might be - but you must get out of here at
   once and stay away. You'd better thank Heaven it didn't go further...

   "I'm going to prepare you as bluntly as I can. There's been a certain
   change - in your personal appearance. He always causes that. But in a new
   country you can get used to it. There's a mirror up at the other end of
   the room, and I'm going to take you to it. You'll get a shock - though you
   will see nothing repulsive."

   I was now shaking with a deadly fear, and the bearded man almost had to
   hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror, the faint lamp
   (i.e., that formerly on the table, not the still fainter lantern he had
   brought) in his free hand. This is what I saw in the glass:

   A thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the
   Anglican church, apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel-bowed
   glasses glistening beneath a sallow, olive forehead of abnormal height.

   It was the silent first-comer who had burned his books.

   For all the rest of my life, in outward form, I was to be that man!
