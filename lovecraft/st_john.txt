St. John

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                      St. John, whose art sublimely shines 
                      In liquid odes and melting lines,    
                      Let Theobald his regard express      
                      In verse of lesser loveliness.       
                      As now in regal state appear         
                      The festive hours of Yuletide cheer, 
                      My strongest wish is that you may    
                      Feel ev'ry blessing of the day!
