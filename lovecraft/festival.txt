     Efficiut Daemones, ut quae non sunt, sic tamen quasi sint, conspicienda

                                                                  - Lacantius

     (Devils so work that things which are not appear to men as if they were
     real.)

   I was far from home, and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me. In the
   twilight I heard it pounding on the rocks, and I knew it lay just over the
   hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing sky and the
   first stars of evening. And because my fathers had called me to the old
   town beyond, I pushed on through the shallow, new-fallen snow along the
   road that soared lonely up to where Aldebaran twinkled among the trees; on
   toward the very ancient town I had never seen but often dreamed of.

   It was the Yuletide, that men call Christmas though they know in their
   hearts it is older than Bethlehem and Babylon, older than Memphis and
   mankind. It was the Yuletide, and I had come at last to the ancient sea
   town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when
   festival was forbidden; where also they had commanded their sons to keep
   festival once every century, that the memory of primal secrets might not
   be forgotten. Mine were an old people, and were old even when this land
   was settled three hundred years before. And they were strange, because
   they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate southern gardens of
   orchids, and spoken another tongue before they learnt the tongue of the
   blue-eyed fishers. And now they were scattered, and shared only the
   rituals of mysteries that none living could understand. I was the only one
   who came back that night to the old fishing town as legend bade, for only
   the poor and the lonely remember.

   Then beyond the hill's crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in the
   gloaming; snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples, ridgepoles
   and chimney-pots, wharves and small bridges, willow-trees and graveyards;
   endless labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked streets, and dizzy
   church-crowned central peak that time durst not touch; ceaseless mazes of
   colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a
   child's disordered blocks; antiquity hovering on grey wings over
   winter-whitened gables and gambrel roofs; fanlights and small-paned
   windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join Orion and the
   archaic stars. And against the rotting wharves the sea pounded; the
   secretive, immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the elder
   time.

   Beside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose, bleak and
   windswept, and I saw that it was a burying-ground where black gravestones
   stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed fingernails of a
   gigantic corpse. The printless road was very lonely, and sometimes I
   thought I heard a distant horrible creaking as of a gibbet in the wind.
   They had hanged four kinsmen of mine for witchcraft in 1692, but I did not
   know just where.

   As the road wound down the seaward slope I listened for the merry sounds
   of a village at evening, but did not hear them. Then I thought of the
   season, and felt that these old Puritan folk might well have Christmas
   customs strange to me, and full of silent hearthside prayer. So after that
   I did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers, kept on down past
   the hushed lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls to where the signs
   of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked in the salt breeze, and the
   grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened along deserted unpaved
   lanes in the light of little, curtained windows.

   I had seen maps of the town, and knew where to find the home of my people.
   It was told that I should be known and welcomed, for village legend lives
   long; so I hastened through Back Street to Circle Court, and across the
   fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the town, to where Green
   Lane leads off behind the Market House. The old maps still held good, and
   I had no trouble; though at Arkham they must have lied when they said the
   trolleys ran to this place, since I saw not a wire overhead. Snow would
   have hid the rails in any case. I was glad I had chosen to walk, for the
   white village had seemed very beautiful from the hill; and now I was eager
   to knock at the door of my people, the seventh house on the left in Green
   Lane, with an ancient peaked roof and jutting second storey, all built
   before 1650.

   There were lights inside the house when I came upon it, and I saw from the
   diamond window-panes that it must have been kept very close to its antique
   state. The upper part overhung the narrow grass-grown street and nearly
   met the over-hanging part of the house opposite, so that I was almost in a
   tunnel, with the low stone doorstep wholly free from snow. There was no
   sidewalk, but many houses had high doors reached by double flights of
   steps with iron railings. It was an odd scene, and because I was strange
   to New England I had never known its like before. Though it pleased me, I
   would have relished it better if there had been footprints in the snow,
   and people in the streets, and a few windows without drawn curtains.

   When I sounded the archaic iron knocker I was half afraid. Some fear had
   been gathering in me, perhaps because of the strangeness of my heritage,
   and the bleakness of the evening, and the queerness of the silence in that
   aged town of curious customs. And when my knock was answered I was fully
   afraid, because I had not heard any footsteps before the door creaked
   open. But I was not afraid long, for the gowned, slippered old man in the
   doorway had a bland face that reassured me; and though he made signs that
   he was dumb, he wrote a quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax
   tablet he carried.

   He beckoned me into a low, candle-lit room with massive exposed rafters
   and dark, stiff, sparse furniture of the seventeenth century. The past was
   vivid there, for not an attribute was missing. There was a cavernous
   fireplace and a spinning-wheel at which a bent old woman in loose wrapper
   and deep poke-bonnet sat back toward me, silently spinning despite the
   festive season. An indefinite dampness seemed upon the place, and I
   marvelled that no fire should be blazing. The high-backed settle faced the
   row of curtained windows at the left, and seemed to be occupied, though I
   was not sure. I did not like everything about what I saw, and felt again
   the fear I had had. This fear grew stronger from what had before lessened
   it, for the more I looked at the old man's bland face the more its very
   blandness terrified me. The eyes never moved, and the skin was too much
   like wax. Finally I was sure it was not a face at all, but a fiendishly
   cunning mask. But the flabby hands, curiously gloved, wrote genially on
   the tablet and told me I must wait a while before I could be led to the
   place of the festival.

   Pointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left the
   room; and when I sat down to read I saw that the books were hoary and
   mouldy, and that they included old Morryster's wild Marvels of Science,
   the terrible Saducismus Triumphatus of Joseph Glanvil, published in 1681,
   the shocking Daemonolatreja of Remigius, printed in 1595 at Lyons, and
   worst of all, the unmentionable Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul
   Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius' forbidden Latin translation; a book which I
   had never seen, but of which I had heard monstrous things whispered. No
   one spoke to me, but I could hear the creaking of signs in the wind
   outside, and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman continued her
   silent spinning, spinning. I thought the room and the books and the people
   very morbid and disquieting, but because an old tradition of my fathers
   had summoned me to strange feastings, I resolved to expect queer things.
   So I tried to read, and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something I
   found in that accursed Necronomicon; a thought and a legend too hideous
   for sanity or consciousness, but I disliked it when I fancied I heard the
   closing of one of the windows that the settle faced, as if it had been
   stealthily opened. It had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the
   old woman's spinning-wheel. This was not much, though, for the old woman
   was spinning very hard, and the aged clock had been striking. After that I
   lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle, and was reading
   intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in
   a loose antique costume, and sat down on that very bench, so that I could
   not see him. It was certainly nervous waiting, and the blasphemous book in
   my hands made it doubly so. When eleven struck, however, the old man stood
   up, glided to a massive carved chest in a corner, and got two hooded
   cloaks; one of which he donned, and the other of which he draped round the
   old woman, who was ceasing her monotonous spinning. Then they both started
   for the outer door; the woman lamely creeping, and the old man, after
   picking lip the very book I had been reading, beckoning me as he drew his
   hood over that unmoving face or mask.

   We went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly
   ancient town; went out as the lights in the curtained windows disappeared
   one by one, and the Dog Star leered at the throng of cowled, cloaked
   figures that poured silently from every doorway and formed monstrous
   processions up this street and that, past the creaking sigus and
   antediluvian gables, the thatched roofs and diamond-paned windows;
   threading precipitous lanes where decaying houses overlapped and crumbled
   together; gliding across open courts and churchyards where the bobbing
   lanthorns made eldritch drunken constellations.

   Amid these hushed throngs I followed my voiceless guides; jostled by
   elbows that seemed preternaturally soft, and pressed by chests and
   stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and hearing
   never a word. Up, up, up, the eery columns slithered, and I saw that all
   the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of
   crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the town, where
   perched a great white church. I had seen it from the road's crest when I
   looked at Kingsport in the new dusk, and it had made me shiver because
   Aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the ghostly spire.

   There was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with
   spectral shafts, and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of snow
   by the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked
   roofs and overhanging gables. Death-fires danced over the tombs, revealing
   gruesome vistas, though queerly failing to cast any shadows. Past the
   churchyard, where there were no houses, I could see over the hill's summit
   and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour, though the town was
   invisible in the dark. Only once in a while a lanthorn bobbed horribly
   through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng that was now
   slipping speechlessly into the church. I waited till the crowd had oozed
   into the black doorway, and till all the stragglers had followed. The old
   man was pulling at my sleeve, but I was determined to be the last.
   Crossing the threshold into the swarming temple of unknown darkness, I
   turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence
   cast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement. And as I did so I shuddered.
   For though the wind had not left much snow, a few patches did remain on
   the path near the door; and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my
   troubled eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet, not even mine.

   The church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it,
   for most of the throng had already vanished. They had streamed up the
   aisle between the high pews to the trap-door of the vaults which yawned
   loathsomely open just before the pulpit, and were now squinning
   noiselessly in. I followed dumbly down the foot-worn steps and into the
   dark, suffocating crypt. The tail of that sinuous line of night-marchers
   seemed very horrible, and as I saw them wriggling into a venerable tomb
   they seemed more horrible still. Then I noticed that the tomb's floor had
   an aperture down which the throng was sliding, and in a moment we were all
   descending an ominous staircase of rough-hewn stone; a narrow spiral
   staircase damp and peculiarly odorous, that wound endlessly down into the
   bowels of the hill past monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and
   crumbling mortar. It was a silent, shocking descent, and I observed after
   a horrible interval that the walls and steps were changing in nature, as
   if chiselled out of the solid rock. What mainly troubled me was that the
   myriad footfalls made no sound and set up no echoes. After more aeons of
   descent I saw some side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses
   of blackness to this shaft of nighted mystery. Soon they became
   excessively numerous, like impious catacombs of nameless menace; and their
   pungent odour of decay grew quite unbearable. I knew we must have passed
   down through the mountain and beneath the earth of Kingsport itself, and I
   shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous
   evil.

   Then I saw the lurid shimmering of pale light, and heard the insidious
   lapping of sunless waters. Again I shivered, for I did not like the things
   that the night had brought, and wished bitterly that no forefather had
   summoned me to this primal rite. As the steps and the passage grew
   broader, I heard another sound, the thin, whining mockery of a feeble
   flute; and suddenly there spread out before me the boundless vista of an
   inner world - a vast fungous shore litten by a belching column of sick
   greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river that flowed from abysses
   frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest gulfs of immemorial ocean.

   Fainting and gasping, I looked at that unhallowed Erebus of titan
   toadstools, leprous fire and slimy water, and saw the cloaked throngs
   forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar. It was the Yule-rite,
   older than man and fated to survive him; the primal rite of the solstice
   and of spring's promise beyond the snows; the rite of fire and evergreen,
   light and music. And in the stygian grotto I saw them do the rite, and
   adore the sick pillar of flame, and throw into the water handfuls gouged
   out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in the chlorotic
   glare. I saw this, and I saw something amorphously squatted far away from
   the light, piping noisomely on a flute; and as the thing piped I thought I
   heard noxious muffled flutterings in the foetid darkness where I could not
   see. But what frightened me most was that flaming column; spouting
   volcanically from depths profound and inconceivable, casfing no shadows as
   healthy flame should, and coating the nitrous stone with a nasty, venomous
   verdigris. For in all that seething combustion no warmth lay, but only the
   clamminess of death and corruption.

   The man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the
   hideous flame, and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semi-circle he
   faced. At certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance,
   especially when he held above his head that abhorrent Necronomicon he had
   taken with him; and I shared all the obeisances because I had been
   summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers. Then the old
   man made a sigual to the half-seen flute-player in the darkness, which
   player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in
   another key; precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and
   unexpected. At this horror I sank nearly to the lichened earth, transfixed
   with a dread not of this or any world, but only of the mad spaces between
   the stars.

   Out of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold
   flame, out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled
   uncanny, unheard, and unsuspected, there flopped rhythmically a horde of
   tame, trained, hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly
   grasp, or sound brain ever wholly remember. They were not altogether
   crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats, nor decomposed
   human beings; but something I cannot and must not recall. They flopped
   limply along, half with their webbed feet and half with their membranous
   wings; and as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures
   seized and mounted them, and rode off one by one along the reaches of that
   unlighted river, into pits and galleries of panic where poison springs
   feed frightful and undiscoverable cataracts.

   The old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man remained
   only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride
   like the rest. I saw when I staggered to my feet that the amorphous
   flute-player had rolled out of sight, but that two of the beasts were
   patiently standing by. As I hung back, the old man produced his stylus and
   tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my fathers who had founded
   the Yule worship in this ancient place; that it had been decreed I should
   come back, and that the most secret mysteries were yet to be performed. He
   wrote this in a very ancient hand, and when I still hesitated he pulled
   from his loose robe a seal ring and a watch, both with my family arms, to
   prove that he was what he said. But it was a hideous proof, because I knew
   from old papers that that watch had been buried with my
   great-great-great-great-grandfather in 1698.

   Presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family
   resemblance in his face, but I only shuddered, because I was sure that the
   face was merely a devilish waxen mask. The flopping animals were now
   scratching restlessly at the lichens, and I saw that the old man was
   nearly as restless himself. When one of the things began to waddle and
   edge away, he turned quickly to stop it; so that the suddenness of his
   motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his head. And
   then, because that nightmare's position barred me from the stone staircase
   down which we had come, I flung myself into the oily underground river
   that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea; flung myself into that
   putrescent juice of earth's inner horrors before the madness of my screams
   could bring down upon me all the charnel legions these pest-gulfs might
   conceal.

   At the hospital they told me I had been found half-frozen in Kingsport
   Harbour at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save
   me. They told me I had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the night
   before, and fallen over the cliffs at Orange Point; a thing they deduced
   from prints found in the snow. There was nothing I could say, because
   everything was wrong. Everything was wrong, with the broad windows showing
   a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was ancient, and the sound
   of trolleys and motors in the streets below. They insisted that this was
   Kingsport, and I could not deny it. When I went delirious at hearing that
   the hospital stood near the old churchyard on Central Hill, they sent me
   to St Mary's Hospital in Arkham, where I could have better care. I liked
   it there, for the doctors were broad-minded, and even lent me their
   influence in obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of Alhazred's
   objectionable Necronomicon from the library of Miskatonic University. They
   said something about a "psychosis" and agreed I had better get any
   harassing obsessions off my mind.

   So I read that hideous chapter, and shuddered doubly because it was indeed
   not new to me. I had seen it before, let footprints tell what they might;
   and where it was I had seen it were best forgotten. There was no one - in
   waking hours - who could remind me of it; but my dreams are filled with
   terror, because of phrases I dare not quote. I dare quote only one
   paragraph, put into such English as I can make from the awkward Low Latin.

   "The nethermost caverns," wrote the mad Arab, "are not for the fathoming
   of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and terrific. Cursed the
   ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied, and evil the mind
   that is held by no head. Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy is the
   tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards
   are all ashes. For it is of old rumour that the soul of the devil-bought
   hastes not from his charnel clay, but fats and instructs the very worm
   that gnaws; till out of corruption horrid life springs, and the dull
   scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it.
   Great holes secretly are digged where earth's pores ought to suffice, and
   things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl."
