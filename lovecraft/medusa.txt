   The drive toward Cape Girardeau had been through unfamiliar country; and
   as the late afternoon light grew golden and half-dreamlike I realized that
   I must have directions if I expected to reach the town before night. I did
   not care to be wandering about these bleak southern Missouri lowlands
   after dark, for roads were poor and the November cold rather formidable in
   an open roadster. Black clouds, too, were massing on the horizon; so I
   looked about among the long, grey and blue shadows that streaked the flat,
   brownish fields, hoping to glimpse some house where I might get the needed
   information.

   It was a lonely and deserted country, but at last I spied a roof among a
   clump of trees near the small river on my right; perhaps a full half-mile
   from the road, and probably reachable by some path or drive which I would
   presently come upon. In the absence of any nearer dwelling, I resolved to
   try my luck there; and was glad when the bushes by the roadside revealed
   the ruin of a carved stone gateway, covered with dry, dead vines and
   choked with undergrowth which explained why I had not been able to trace
   the path across the fields in my first distant view. I saw that I could
   not drive the car in, so I parked it very carefully near the gate - where
   a thick evergreen would shield it in case of rain - and got out for the
   long walk to the house.

   Traversing that brush-growth path in the gathering twilight I was
   conscious of a distinct sense of foreboding, probably induced by the air
   of sinister decay hovering about the gate and the former driveway. From
   the carvings on the old stone pillars I inferred that this place was once
   an estate of manorial dignity; and I could clearly see that the driveway
   had originally boasted guardian lines of linden trees, some of which had
   died, while others had lost their special identity among the wild scrub
   growths of the region.

   As I ploughed onward, cockleburs and stickers clung to my clothes, and I
   began to wonder whether the place could be inhabited after all. Was I
   tramping on a vain errand? For a moment I was tempted to go back and try
   some farm farther along the road, when a view of the house ahead aroused
   my curiosity and stimulated my venturesome spirit.

   There was something provocatively fascinating in the tree-girt, decrepit
   pile before me, for it spoke of the graces and spaciousness of a bygone
   era and a far more southerly environment. It was a typical wooden
   plantation house of the classic, early nineteenth-century pattern, with
   two and a half stories and a great Ionic portico whose pillars reached up
   as far as the attic and supported a triangular pediment. Its state of
   decay was extreme and obvious; one of the vast columns having rotted and
   fallen to the ground, while the upper piazza or balcony had sagged
   dangerously low. Other buildings, I judged, had formerly stood near it.

   As I mounted the broad stone steps to the low porch and the carved and
   fanlighted doorway I felt distinctly nervous, and started to light a
   cigarette - desisting when I saw how dry and inflammable everything about
   me was. Though now convinced that the house was deserted, I nevertheless
   hesitated to violate its dignity without knocking; so tugged at the rusty
   iron knocker until I could get it to move, and finally set up a cautious
   rapping which seemed to make the whole place shake and rattle. There was
   no response, yet once more I plied the cumbrous, creaking device - as much
   to dispel the sense of unholy silence and solitude as to arouse any
   possible occupant of the ruin.

   Somewhere near the river I heard the mournful not of a dove, and it seemed
   as if the coursing water itself were faintly audible. Half in a dream, I
   seized and rattled the ancient latch, and finally gave the great
   six-panelled door a frank trying. It was unlocked, as I could see in a
   moment; and though it stuck and grated on its hinges I began to push it
   open, stepping through it into a vast shadowy hall as I did so.

   But the moment I took this step I regretted it. It was not that a legion
   of specters confronted me in that dim and dusty hall with the ghostly
   Empire furniture; but that I knew all at once that the place was not
   deserted at all. There was a creaking on the great curved staircase, and
   the sound of faltering footsteps slowly descending. Then I saw a tall,
   bent figure silhouetted for an instant against the great Palladian window
   on the landing.

   My first start of terror was soon over, and as the figure descended the
   final flight I was ready to greet the householder whose privacy I had
   invaded. In the semi-darkness I could see him reach in his pocket for a
   match. There came a flare as he lighted a small kerosene lamp which stood
   on a rickety console table near the foot of the stairs. In the feeble glow
   was revealed the stooping figure of a very tall, emaciated old man;
   disordered as to dress and unshaved as to face, yet for all that with the
   bearing and expression of a gentleman.

   I did not wait for him to speak, but at once began to explain my presence.

   "You'll pardon my coming in like this, but when my knocking didn't raise
   anybody I concluded that no one lived here. What I wanted originally was
   to know the right road to Cape Girardeau - the shortest road, that is. I
   wanted to get there before dark, but now, of course - "

   As I paused, the man spoke; in exactly the cultivated tone I had expected,
   and with a mellow accent as unmistakably Southern as the house he
   inhabited.

   "Rather, you must pardon me for not answering your knock more promptly. I
   live in a very retired way, and am not usually expecting visitors. At
   first I thought you were a mere curiosity-seeker. Then when you knocked
   again I started to answer, but I am not well and have to move very slowly.
   Spinal neuritis - very troublesome case.

   "But as for your getting to town before dark - it's plain you can't do
   that. The road you are one - for I suppose you came from the gate - isn't
   the best or shortest way. What you must do is to take your first left
   after you leave the gate - that is, the first real road to your left.
   There are three or four cart paths you can ignore, but you can't mistake
   the real road because of the extra large willow tree on the right just
   opposite it. Then when you've turned, keep on past two roads and turn to
   the right along the third. After that - "

   "Please wait a moment! How can I follow all these clues in pitch darkness,
   without ever having been near here before, and with only an indifferent
   pair of headlights to tell me what is and what isn't a road? Besides, I
   think it's going to storm pretty soon, and my car is an open one. It looks
   as if I were in a bad fix if I want to get to Cape Girardeau tonight. The
   fact is, I don't think I'd better try to make it. I don't like to impose
   burdens, or anything like that - but in view of the circumstances, do you
   suppose you could put me up for the night? I won't be any trouble - no
   meals or anything. Just let me have a corner to sleep in till daylight,
   and I'm all right. I can leave the car in the road where it is - a bit of
   wet weather won't hurt it if worst comes to worst."

   As I made my sudden request I could see the old man's face lose its former
   expression of quiet resignation and take on an odd, surprised look.

   "Sleep - here?"

   He seemed so astonished at my request that I repeated it.

   "Yes, why not? I assure you I won't be any trouble. What else can I do?
   I'm a stranger hereabouts, these roads are a labyrinth in the dark, and
   I'll wager it'll be raining torrents outside of an hour - "

   This time it my host's turn to interrupt, and as he did so I could feel a
   peculiar quality in his deep, musical voice.

   "A stranger - of course you must be, else you wouldn't think of sleeping
   here, wouldn't think of coming here at all. People don't come here
   nowadays."

   He paused, and my desire to stay was increased a thousandfold by the sense
   of mystery his laconic words seemed to evoke. There was surely something
   alluringly queer about this place, and the pervasive musty smell seemed to
   cloak a thousand secrets. Again I noticed the extreme decrepitude of
   everything about me; manifest even in the feeble rays of the single small
   lamp. I felt woefully chilly, and saw with regret that no heating was
   provided, and yet so great was my curiosity that I still wished most
   ardently to stay and learn something of the recluse and his dismal abode.

   "Let that be as it may," I replied. "I can't help about other people. But
   I surely would like to have a spot to stop till daylight. Still - if
   people don't relish this place, mayn't it be because it's getting so
   run-down? Of course I suppose it a take a fortune to keep such an estate
   up, but if the burden's too great why don't you look for smaller quarters?
   Why try to stick it out here in this way - with all the hardships and
   discomforts?"

   The man did not seem offended, but answered me very gravely.

   "Surely you may stay if you really wish to - you can come to no harm that
   I know of. But others claim there are certain peculiarly undesirable
   influences here. As for me - I stay here because I have to. There is
   something I feel it a duty to guard - something that holds me. I wish I
   had the money and health and ambition to take decent care of the house and
   grounds."

   With my curiosity still more heightened, I prepared to take my host at his
   word; and followed him slowly upstairs when he motioned me to do so. It
   was very dark now, and a faint pattering outside told me that the
   threatened rain had come. I would have been glad of any shelter, but this
   was doubly welcome because of the hints of mystery about the place and its
   master. For an incurable lover of the grotesque, no more fitting haven
   could have been provided.

                                       II

   There was a second-floor corner room in less unkempt shape than the rest
   of the house, and into this my host led me, setting down his small lamp
   and lighting a somewhat larger one. From the cleanliness and contents of
   the room, and from the books ranged along the walls, I could see that I
   had not guessed amiss in thinking the man a gentleman of taste of
   breeding. He was a hermit and eccentric, no doubt, but he still had
   standards and intellectual interests. As he waved me to a seat I began a
   conversation on general topics, and was pleased to find him not at all
   taciturn. If anything, he seemed glad of someone to talk, and did not even
   attempt to swerve the discussion from personal topics.

   He was, I learned, one Antoine de Russy, of an ancient, powerful, and
   cultivated line of Louisiana planters. More than a century ago his
   grandfather, a younger so, had migrated to southern Missouri and founded a
   new estate in the lavish ancestral manner; building this pillared mansion
   and surrounding it with all the accessories of a great plantation. There
   had been, at one time, as many as 200 negroes in the cabins which stood on
   the flat ground in the rear - ground that the river had now invaded - and
   to hear them singing and laughing and playing the banjo at night was to
   know the fullest charm of a civilization and social order now sadly
   extinct. In front of the house, where the great guardian oaks and willows
   stood, there had been a lawn like a broad green carpet, always watered and
   trimmed and with flagstoned, flower-bordered walks curving through it.
   "Riverside" - for such the place was called - had been a lovely and
   idyllic homestead in its day; and my host could recall it when many traces
   of its best period.

   It was raining hard now, with dense sheets of water beating against the
   insecure roof, walls, and windows, and sending in drops through a thousand
   chinks and crevices. Moisture trickled down to the floor from unsuspected
   places, and the mounting wind rattled the rotting, loose-hinged shutters
   outside. But I minded none of this, for I saw that a story was coming.
   Incited to reminiscence, my host made a move to shew me to
   sleeping-quarters; but kept on recalling the older, better days. Soon, I
   saw, I would receive an inkling of why he lived alone in that ancient
   place, and why his neighbours thought it full of undesirable influences.
   His voice was very musical as he spoke on, and his tale soon took a turn
   which left me no chance to grow drowsy.

   "Yes - Riverside was built in 1816, and my father was born in 1828. He'd
   be over a century old now if he were alive, but he died young - so young I
   can just barely remember him. In '64 that was - he was killed in the war,
   Seventh Louisiana Infantry C.S.A., for he went back to the old home to
   enlist. My grandfather was too old to fight, yet he lived on to be
   ninety-five, and helped my mother bring me up. A good bringing-up, too -
   I'll give them credit. We always had strong traditions - high notions of
   honor - and my grandfather saw to it that I grew up the way de Russys have
   grown up, generation after generation, ever since the Crusades. We weren't
   quite wiped out financially, but managed to get on very comfortable after
   the war. I went to a good school in Louisiana, and later to Princeton.
   Later on I was able to get the plantation on a fairly profitable basis -
   though you see what it's come to now.

   "My mother died when I was twenty, and my grandfather two years later. It
   was rather lonely after that; and in '85 I married a distant cousin in New
   Orleans. Things might have bee different if she'd lived, but she died when
   my son Denis was born. Then I had only Denis. I didn't try marriage again,
   but gave all my time to the boy. He was like me - like all the de Russys -
   darkish and tall and thin, and with the devil of a temper. I gave him the
   same training my grandfather had give me, but he didn't need much training
   when it came to points of honor. It was in him, I reckon. Never saw such
   high spirit - all I could do to keep him from running away to the Spanish
   War when he was eleven! Romantic young devil, too - full of high notions -
   you'd call 'em Victorian, now - no trouble at all to make him let the
   nigger wenches alone. I sent him to the same school I'd gone to, and to
   Princeton, too. He was Class of 1909.

   "In the end he decided to be a doctor, and went a year to the Harvard
   Medical School. Then he hit on the idea of keeping to the old French
   tradition of the family, and argued me into sending him across to the
   Sorbonne. I did - and proudly enough, though I knew I'd be how lonely I'd
   be with him so far off. Would to God I hadn't! I thought he was the safest
   kind of boy to be in Paris. He had a room in the Rue St. Jacques - that's
   near the University in the 'Latin Quarter' - but according to his letters
   and his friends he didn't cut up with the gayer dogs at all. The people he
   knew were mostly young fellows from home - serious students and artists
   who thought more of their work than of striking attitudes and painting the
   town red.

   "But of course there were lots of fellows who were on a sort of dividing
   line between serious studies and the devil. The aesthetes - the decadents,
   you know. Experiments in life and sensation - the Baudelaire kind of a
   chap. Naturally Denis ran up against a good many of these, and saw a good
   deal of their life. They had all sorts of crazy circles and cults -
   imitation devil-worship, fake Black Masses, and the like. Doubt if it did
   them much harm on the whole - probably most of 'em forgot all about it in
   a year or two. One of the deepest in this queer stuff was a fellow Denis
   had known at school - for that matter, whose father I'd known myself.
   Frank Marsh, of New Orleans. Disciple of Lafcadio Hearn and Gauguin and
   Van Gogh - regular epitome of the yellow 'nineties. Poor devil - he had
   the makings of a great artist, at that.

   "Marsh was the oldest friend Denis had in Paris, so as a matter of course
   they saw a good deal of each other - to talk over old times at St. Clair
   academy, and all that. The boy wrote me a good deal about him, and I
   didn't see any especial harm when he spoke of the group of mystics Marsh
   ran with. It seems there was some cult of prehistoric Egyptian and
   Carthaginian magic having a rage among the Bohemian element on the left
   bank - some nonsensical thing that pretended to reach back to forgotten
   sources of hidden truth in lost African civilisations - the great
   Zimbabwe, the dead Atlantean cities in the Haggar region of the Sahara -
   and they had a lot of gibberish concerned with snakes and human hair. At
   least, I called it gibberish, then. Denis used to quote Marsh as saying
   odd things about the veiled facts behind the legend of Medusa's snaky
   locks - and behind the later Ptolemaic myth of Berenice, who offered up
   her hair to save her husband-brother, and had it set in the sky as the
   constellation Coma Berenices.

   "I don't think this business made much impression on Denis until the night
   of the queer ritual at Marsh's rooms when he met the priestess. Most of
   the devotees of the cult were young fellows, but the head of it was a
   young woman who called herself 'Tanit-Isis' - letting it be known that her
   real name - her name in this latest incarnation, as she put it - was
   Marceline Bedard. She claimed to be the left-handed daughter of Marquis de
   Chameaux, and seemed to have been both a petty artist and an artist's
   model before adopting this more lucrative magical game. Someone said she
   had lived for a time in the West Indies - Martinique, I think - but she
   was very reticent about herself. Part of her pose was a great show of
   austerity and holiness, but I don't think the more experienced students
   took that very seriously.

   "Denis, though, was far from experienced, and wrote me fully ten pages of
   slush about the goddess he had discovered. If I'd only realised his
   simplicity I might have done something, but I never thought a puppy
   infatuation like could mean much. I felt absurdly sure that Denis' touchy
   personal honour and family pride would always keep him out of the most
   serious complications.

   "As time went, though, his letters began to make me nervous. He mentioned
   this Marceline more and more, and his friends less and les, and began
   talking about the 'cruel and silly way' they declined to introduce her to
   their mothers and sisters. He seems to have asked her no questions about
   herself, and I don't doubt but that she filled him full of romantic
   legendry concerning her origin and divine revelations and the way people
   slighted her. At length I could see that Denis was altogether cutting his
   own crowd and spending the bulk of his time with his alluring priestess.
   At her especial request he never told the old crowd of their continual
   meetings; so nobody over there tried to break the affair up.

   "I suppose she thought he was fabulously rich; for he had the air of a
   patrician, and people of a certain class think all aristocratic Americans
   are wealthy. In any case, she probably thought this a rare chance to
   contract a genuine right-handed alliance with a really eligible young man.
   By the time my nervousness burst into open advice, it was too late. The
   boy had lawfully married her, and wrote that he was dropping his studies
   and bringing the woman home to Riverside. He said she had made a great
   sacrifice and resigned her leadership of the magical cult, and that
   henceforward she would be merely a private gentlewoman - the future
   mistress of Riverside, and mother of de Russys to come.

   "Well, sir, I took it the best way I could. I knew that sophisticated
   Continentals have different standards from our old American ones - and
   anyway, I really knew nothing against the woman. A charlatan, perhaps, but
   why necessarily any worse? I suppose I tried to keep as naive as possible
   about such things in those days, for the boy's sake. Clearly, there was
   nothing for a man of sense to do but let Denis alone so long as his new
   wife conformed to de Russy ways. Let her have a chance to prove herself -
   perhaps she wouldn't hurt the family as much as some might fear. So I
   didn't raise any objections or ask any penitence. The thing was done, and
   I stood ready to welcome the boy back, whatever he brought with him.

   "They got here three weeks after the telegram telling of marriage.
   Marceline was beautiful - there was no denying that - and I could see how
   the boy might very well get foolish about her. She did have an air of
   breeding, and I think to this day she must have had some strains of good
   blood in her. She was apparently not much over twenty; of medium size,
   fairly slim, and as graceful as a tigress in posture and motion. Her
   complexion was a deep olive - like old ivory - and her eyes were large and
   very dark. She had small, classically regular features - though not quite
   clean-cut enough to suit my taste - and the most singular braid of jet
   black hair that I ever saw.

   "I didn't wonder that she had dragged the subject of hair into her magical
   cult, for with that heavy profusion of it the idea must have occurred to
   her naturally. Coiled up, it made her look like some Oriental princess in
   a drawing of Aubrey Beardsley's. Hanging down her back, it came well below
   her knees and shone in the light as if it had possessed some separate,
   unholy vitality of its own. I would almost have thought of Medusa or
   Berenice myself - without having such things suggested to me - upon seeing
   and studying that hair.

   "Sometimes I thought it moved slightly of itself, and tended to arrange
   itself in distinct ropes or strands, but this may have been sheer
   illusion. She braided it incessantly, and seemed to use some sort of
   preparation on it. I got the notion once - a curious, whimsical notion -
   that it was a living being which she had to feed in some strange way. All
   nonsense - but it added to my feeling of constraint about her and her
   hair.

   "For I can't deny that I failed to like her wholly, no matter how hard I
   tried. I couldn't tell what the trouble was, but it was there. Something
   about her repelled me very subtly, and I could not help weaving morbid and
   macabre associations about everything connected with her. Her complexion
   called up thoughts of Babylon, Atlantis, Lemuria, and the terrible
   forgotten dominations of an elder world; her eyes struck me sometimes as
   the eyes of some unholy forest creature or animal goddess too immeasurably
   ancient to be fully human; and her hair - that dense, exotic,
   overnourished growth of oily inkiness - made one shiver as a great black
   python might have done. There was no doubt but that she realised my
   involuntary attitude - though I tried to hide it, and she tried to hide
   the fact that she noticed it.

   "Yet the boy's infatuation lasted. He positively fawned on her, and
   overdid all the little gallantries of daily life to a sickening degree.
   She appeared to return the feeling, though I could see it took a conscious
   effort to make her duplicate his enthusiasms and extravagances. For one
   thing, I think she was piqued to learn we weren't as wealthy as she had
   expected.

   "It was a bad business all told. I could see that sad undercurrents were
   arising. Denis was half-hypnotised with puppy-love, and began to grow away
   from as he felt my shrinking from his wife. This kind of thing went on for
   months, and I saw that I was losing my only son - the boy who had formed
   the centre of all my thoughts and acts for the past quarter century. I'll
   own that I felt bitter about it - what father wouldn't? And yet I could do
   nothing.

   "Marceline seemed to be a good wife enough in those early months, and our
   friends received her without any quibbling or questioning. I was always
   nervous, though, about what some of the young fellows in Paris might write
   home to their relatives after the news of the marriage spread around.
   Despite the woman's love of secrecy, it couldn't remain hidden forever -
   indeed, Denis had written a few of his closest friends, in strict
   confidence, as soon as he was settled with her at Riverside.

   "I got to staying alone in my room more and more, with my failing health
   as an excuse. It was bout that time that my present spinal neuritis began
   to develop - which made the excuse a pretty good one. Denis didn't seem to
   notice the trouble, or take any interest in me and my habits and affairs;
   and it hurt me to see how callous he was getting. I began to get
   sleepless, and often racked my brain in the night to try to find out what
   made my new daughter-in-law so repulsive and even dimly horrible to me. It
   surely wasn't her old mystical nonsense, for she had left all the past
   behind her and never mentioned it once. She didn't even do any painting,
   although I understood that she had once dabbled in art.

   "Oddly, the only ones who seemed to share my uneasiness were the servants.
   The darkies around the house seemed very sullen in their attitude toward
   her, and in a few weeks all save the few who were strongly attached to our
   family had left. These few - old Scipio and his wife Sarah, the cook
   Delilah, and Mary, Scipio's daughter - were as civil as possible; but
   plainly revealed that their new mistress commanded their duty rather than
   their affection. They stayed in their own remote part of the house as much
   as possible. McCabe, our white chauffeur, was insolently admiring rather
   than hostile; and another exception was a very old Zulu woman, said to
   have been a sort of leader in her small cabin as a kind of family
   pensioner. Old Sophonisba always shewed reverence whenever Marceline came
   near her, and one time I saw her kiss the ground where her mistress had
   walked. Blacks are superstitious animals, and I wondered whether Marceline
   had been talking any of her mystical nonsense to our hands in order to
   overcome their evident dislike."

                                      III

   "Well, that's how we went on for nearly half a year. Then, in the summer
   of 1916, things began to happen. Toward the middle of June Denis got a
   note from his old friend Frank Marsh, telling of a sort of nervous
   breakdown which made him want to take a rest in the country. It was
   postmarked New Orleans - for Marsh had gone home from Paris when he felt
   the collapse coming on - and seemed a very plain though polite bid for an
   invitation from us. Marsh, of course, knew that Marceline was here; and
   asked very courteously after her. Denis was sorry to hear of his trouble
   and told him at once to come along for an indefinite visit.

   "Marsh came - and I was shocked to notice how he had changed since I had
   seen him in his earlier days. He was a smallish, lightish fellow, with
   blue eyes and an undecided chin; and now I could see the effects of drink
   and I don't know what else in his puffy eyelids, enlarged nose-pores, and
   heavy lines around the mouth. I reckon he had taken his dose of decadence
   pretty seriously, and set out to be as much of a Rimbaud, Baudelaire, or
   Lautreamont as he could. And yet he was delightful to talk to - for like
   all decadents he was exquisitely sensitive to the color and atmosphere and
   names of things; admirably, thoroughly alive, and with whole records of
   conscious experience in obscure, shadowy fields of living and feeling
   which most of us pass over without knowing they exist. Poor young devil -
   if only his father had lived longer and taken him in hand! There was great
   stuff in the boy!

   "I was glad of the visit, for I felt it would help to set up a normal
   atmosphere in the house again. And that's what it really seemed to do at
   first; for as I said, Marsh was a delight to have around. He was as
   sincere and profound an artist as I ever saw in my life, and I certainly
   believe that nothing on earth mattered to him except the perception and
   expression of beauty. When he saw an exquisite thing, or was creating one,
   his eyes would dilate until the light irises were nearly out of sight -
   leaving two mystical black pits in that weak, delicate, chalk-like face;
   black pits opening on strange worlds which none of us could guess about.

   "When he reached here, though, he didn't have many chances to shew this
   tendency; for he had, as he told Denis, gone quite stale. It seems he had
   been very successful as an artist of a bizarre kind - like Fuseli or Goya
   or Sime or Clark Ashton Smith - but had suddenly become played out. The
   world of ordinary things around him had ceased to hold anything he could
   recognize as beauty - beauty, that is, of enough force and poignancy to
   arouse his creative faculty. He had often been this way before - all
   decadents are - but this time he could not invent any new, strange, or
   outre sensation or experience which would supply the needed illusion of
   fresh beauty or stimulatingly adventurous expectancy. He was like a Durtal
   or a des Esseintes at the most jaded point of his curious orbit.

   "Marceline was away when Marsh arrived. She hadn't been enthusiastic about
   his coming, and had refused to decline an invitation from some of our
   friends in St. Louis which came about that time for her and Denis. Denis,
   of course, stayed to receive his guest; but Marceline had gone on alone.
   It was the first time they had ever been separated, and I hoped the
   interval would help to dispel the daze that was making such a fool of the
   boy. Marceline shewed no hurry to get back, but seemed to me to prolong
   her absence as much as she could. Denis stood it better than one would
   have expected from such a doting husband, and seemed more like his old
   self as he talked over other days with Marsh and tried to cheer the
   listless aesthete up.

   "It was Marsh who seemed most impatient to see the woman; perhaps because
   he thought her strange beauty, or some phase of the mysticism which had
   gone into her one-time magical cult, might help to reawaken his interest
   in things and give him another start toward artistic creation. That there
   was no baser reason, I was absolutely certain from what I knew of Marsh's
   character. With all his weaknesses, he was a gentleman - and it had indeed
   relieved me when I first learned that he wanted to come here because his
   willingness to accept Denis' hospitality proved that there was no reason
   why he shouldn't.

   "When, at last, Marceline did return, I could see that Marsh was
   tremendously affected. He did not attempt to make her talk of the bizarre
   thing which she had so definitely abandoned, but was unable to hide a
   powerful admiration which kept his eyes - now dilated in that curious way
   for the first time during his visit - riveted to her every moment she was
   in the room. She, however, seemed uneasy rather than pleased by his steady
   scrutiny - that is, she seemed so at first, though this feeling of hers
   wore away in a few days, and left the two on a basis of the most cordial
   and voluble congeniality. I could see Marsh studying her constantly when
   he thought no one was watching; and I wondered how long it would be that
   only the artist, and not the primitive man, would be aroused by her
   mysterious graces.

   "Denis naturally felt some irritation at this turn of affairs; though he
   realised that his guest was a man of honour and that, as kindred mystics
   and aesthetes, Marceline and Marsh would naturally have things and
   interests to discuss in which a more or less conventional person could
   have no part. He didn't hold anything against anybody, but merely
   regretted that his own imagination was too limited and traditional to let
   him talk with Marceline as Marsh talked. At this stage of things I began
   to see more of the boy. With his wife otherwise busy, he had time to
   remember that he had a father - and a father who was ready to help him in
   any sort of perplexity or difficulty.

   "We often sat together on the veranda watching Marsh and Marceline as they
   rode up or down the drive on horseback, or played tennis on the court that
   used to stretch south of the house. They talked mostly in French, which
   Marsh, though he hadn't more than a quarter-portion of French blood,
   handled more glibly than either Denis or I could speak it. Marceline's
   English, always academically correct, was rapidly improving in accent; but
   it was plain that she relished dropping back into her mother-tongue. As we
   looked at the congenial couple they made, I could see the boy's cheek and
   throat muscles tighten - though he wasn't a whit less ideal a host to
   Marsh, or a whit less considerate husband to Marceline.

   "All this was generally in the afternoon; for Marceline rose very late,
   had breakfast in bed, and took an immense amount of time preparing to come
   downstairs. I never knew of anyone so wrapped up in cosmetics, beauty
   exercises, hair-oils, unguents, and everything of that kind. It was in
   these morning hours that Denis and Marsh did their real visiting, and
   exchanged the close confidences which kept their friendship up despite the
   strain that jealousy imposed.

   "Well, it was in one of those morning talks on the veranda that marsh made
   the proposition which brought on the end. I was laid up with some of my
   neuritis, but had managed to get downstairs and stretch out on the front
   parlour sofa near the long window. Denis and Marsh were just outside; so I
   couldn't help hearing all they said. They had been talking about art, and
   the curious, capricious elements needed to jolt an artist into producing
   the real article, when Marsh suddenly swerved from abstractions to the
   personal application he must have had in mind from the start.

   "'I suppose,' he was saying, 'that nobody can tell just what it is in some
   scenes or objects that makes them aesthetic stimuli for certain
   individuals. Basically, of course, it must have some reference to each
   man's background of stored-up mental associations, for no two people have
   the same scale of sensitiveness and responses. We decadents are artists
   for whom all ordinary things have ceased to have any emotional or
   imaginative significance, but no one of us responds in the same way to
   exactly the same extraordinary. Now take me, for instance...'"

   "He paused and resumed.

   "'I know, Denny, that I can say these things to you because you such a
   preternaturally unspoiled mind - clean, fine, direct, objective, and all
   that. You won't misunderstand as an oversubtilised, effete man of the
   world might.'"

   "He paused once more.

   "'The fact is, I think I know what's needed to set my imagination working
   again. I've had a dim idea of it ever since we were in Paris, but I'm sure
   now. It's Marceline, old chap - that face and that hair, and the train of
   shadowy images they bring up. Not merely visible beauty - though God knows
   there's enough of that - but something peculiar and individualised, that
   can't exactly be explained. Do you know, in the last few days I've felt
   the existence of such a stimulus so keenly that I honestly think I could
   outdo myself - break into the real masterpiece class if I could get ahold
   of paint and canvas at just the time when her face and hair set my fancy
   stirring and weaving. There's something weird and other-worldly about it -
   something joined up with the dim ancient thing Marceline represents. I
   don't know how much she's told you about that side of her, but I can
   assure you there's plenty of it. She has some marvellous links with the
   outside...'

   "Some change in Denis' expression must have halted the speaker here, for
   there was a considerable spell of silence before the words went on. I was
   utterly taken aback, for I'd expected no such overt development like this;
   and I wondered what my son could be thinking. My heart began to pound
   violently, and I strained my ears in the frankest of intentional
   eavesdropping. Then Marsh resumed.

   "'Of course you're jealous - I know how a speech like mine must sound -
   but I can swear to you that you needn't be.'

   "Denis did not answer, and Marsh went on.

   "' To tell the truth, I could never be in love with Marceline - I couldn't
   even be a cordial friend of hers in the warmest sense. Why, damn it all, I
   felt like a hypocrite talking with her these days as I've been doing.

   "'The case simply is, that one of her phase of her half hyponotises me in
   a certain way - a very strange, fantastic, and dimly terrible way - just
   as another phase half hypnotises you in a much more normal way. I see
   something in her - or to be psychologically exact, something through her
   or beyond her - that you didn't see at all. Something that brings up a
   vast pageantry of shapes from forgotten abysses, and makes me want to
   paint incredible things whose outlines vanish the instant I try to
   envisage them clearly. Don't mistake, Denny, your wife is a magnificent
   being, a splendid focus of cosmic forces who has a right to be called
   divine if anything on earth has!'

   "I felt a clearing of the situation at this point, for the abstract
   strangeness of Marsh's statement, plus the flattery he was now heaping on
   Marceline, could not fail to disarm and mollify one as fondly proud of his
   consort as Denis always was. Marsh evidently caught the change himself,
   for there was more confidence in his tone as he continued.

   "'I must paint her, Denny - must paint that hair - and you won't regret.
   There's something more than mortal about that hair - something more than
   beautiful - '

   "He paused, and I wondered what Denis could be thinking. I wondered,
   indeed, what I was really thinking myself. Was Marsh's interest actually
   that of the artist alone, or was he merely infatuated as Denis had been? I
   had thought, in their schooldays, that he had envied my boy; and I dimly
   felt that it might be the same now. On the other hand, something in that
   talk of artistic stimulus had rung amazingly true; so that the more I
   pondered, the more I was inclined to take the stuff at face value. Denis
   seemed to do so, too, for although I could not catch his low-spoken reply,
   I could tell by the effect it produced that it must have been affirmative.

   "There was a sound of someone slapping another on the back, and then a
   grateful speech from Marsh that I was long to remember.

   "'That's great, Denny, and just as I told you, you'll never regret it. In
   a sense, I'm half doing it for you. You'll be a different man when you see
   it. I'll put you back where you used to be - give you a waking-up and a
   sort of salvation - but you can't see what I mean as yet. Just remember
   old friendship, and don't get the idea that I'm not the same old bird!'

   "I rose perplexedly as I saw the two stroll off across the lawn, arm in
   arm, and smoking in unison. What could Marsh have meant by his strange and
   almost ominous reassurance? The more my fears were quieted in one
   direction, the more they were aroused in another. Look at it any way I
   could, it seemed to be a rather bad business.

   "But matters got started just the same. Denis fixed up an attic room with
   skylights, and Marsh sent for all sorts of painting equipment. Everyone
   was rather excited about the new venture, and I was at least glad that
   something was on foot to break the brooding tension. Soon the sittings
   began, and we all took them quite seriously - for we could see that Marsh
   regarded them as important artistic events. Denny and I used to go quietly
   about the house as though something sacred were occurring, and we knew
   that it was sacred as far as marsh was concerned.

   "With Marceline, though, it was a different matter, as I began to see at
   once. Whatever Marsh's reactions to the sittings may have been, hers were
   painfully obvious. Every possible way she betrayed a frank and commonplace
   infatuation for the artist, and would repulse Denis' marks of affection
   whenever she dared. Oddly, I noticed this more vividly than Denis himself,
   and tried to devise some plan for keeping the boy's mind easy until the
   matter could be straightened out. There was no use in having him excited
   about it if it could be helped.

   "In the end I decided that Denis had better be away while the disagreeable
   situation existed. I could represent his interests well enough at this
   end, and sooner or later Marsh would finish the picture and go. My view of
   Marsh's honour was such that I did not look for any worse developments.
   When the matter had blown over, and Marceline had forgotten about her new
   infatuation, it would be time enough to have Denis on hand again.

   "So I wrote a long letter to my marketing and financial agent in New York,
   and cooked up a plan to have the boy summoned there for an indefinite
   time. I had the agent write him that our affairs absolutely required one
   of us to go East, and of course my illness made it clear that I could not
   be the one. It was arranged that when Denis got to New York he would find
   enough plausible matters to keep him busy as long as I thought he ought to
   be away.

   "The plan worked perfectly, and Denis started for New York without the
   least suspicion; Marceline and Marsh going with him in the car to Cape
   Girardeau, where he caught the afternoon train to St. Louis. They returned
   after dark, and as McCabe drove the car back to the stables I could hear
   them talking on the veranda - in those same chairs near the long parlour
   window where Marsh and Denis had sat when I overheard them talk about the
   portrait. This time I resolved to do some intentional eavesdropping, so
   quietly went down to the front parlour and stretched out on the sofa near
   the window.

   "At first I could not hear anything but very shortly there came the sound
   of a chair being shifted, followed by a short, sharp breath and a sort of
   inarticulately hurt exclamation from Marceline. Then I heard Marsh
   speaking in a strained, almost formal voice.

   "'I'd enjoy working tonight if you aren't too tired.'

   "Marceline's reply was in the same hurt tone which had marked her
   exclamation. She used English as he had done.

   "'Oh, Frank, is that really all you care about? Forever working! Can't we
   just sit out here in this glorious moonlight?'

   "He answered impatiently, his voice shewing a certain contempt beneath the
   dominant quality of artistic enthusiasm.

   "'Moonlight! Good God, what cheap sentimentality! For a supposedly
   sophisticated person you surely do hang on to some of the crudest claptrap
   that ever escaped from the dime novels! With art at your elbow, you have
   to think of the moon - cheap as a spotlight at the varieties! Or perhaps
   it makes you think of the Roodmas dance around the stone pillars at
   Auteiul. Hell, how you used to make those goggle-eyed yaps stare! But not
   - I suppose you've dropped all that now. No more Atlantean magic or
   hair-snake rites for Madame de Russy! I'm the only one to remember the old
   things - the things that came down through the temples of Tanit and echoed
   on the ramparts of Zimbabwe. But I won't be cheated of that remembrance -
   all that is weaving itself into the thing on my canvas - the thing that is
   going to capture wonder and crystallise the secrets of 75,000 years...'

   "Marceline interrupted in a voice full of mixed emotions.

   "'It's you who are cheaply sentimental now! You know well that the old
   things had better be let alone. All of you had better watch out if ever I
   chant the old rites or try to call up what lies hidden in Yuggoth,
   Zimbabwe, and R'lyeh. I thought you had more sense!'

   "'You lack logic. You want me to be interested in this precious painting
   of yours, yet you never let me see what you're doing. Always that black
   cloth over it! It's of me - I shouldn't think it would matter if I saw
   it...'

   "Marsh was interrupting this time, his voice curiously hard and strained.

   "'No. Not now. You'll see it in due course of time. You say it's of you -
   yes, it's that, but it's more. If you knew, you mightn't be so impatient.
   Poor Denis! My God, it's a shame!'

   "'My throat was suddenly dry as the words rose to an almost febrile pitch.
   What could Marsh mean? Suddenly I saw that he had stopped and was entering
   the house alone. I heard the front door slam, and listened as his
   footsteps ascended the stairs. Outside on the veranda I could still hear
   Marceline's heavy, angry breathing. I crept away sick at heart, feeling
   that there were grave things to ferret out before I could safely let Denis
   come back.

   "After that evening the tension around the place was even worse than
   before. Marceline had always lived on flattery and fawning and the shock
   of those few blunt words from Marsh was too much for her temperament.
   There was no living in the house with her anymore, for with poor Denis
   gone she took out her abusiveness on everybody. When she could find no one
   indoors to quarrel with she would go out to Sophonisba's cabin and spend
   hours talking with the queer old Zulu woman. Aunt Sophy was the only
   person who would fawn abjectly enough to suit her, and when I tried once
   to overhear their conversation I found Marceline whispering about 'elder
   secrets' and 'unknown Kadath' while the negress rocked to and fro in her
   chair, making inarticulate sounds of reverence and admiration every now
   and then.

   "But nothing could break her dog-like infatuation for Marsh. She would
   talk bitterly and sullenly to him, yet was getting more and more obedient
   to his wishes. It was very convenient for him, since he now became able to
   make her pose for the picture whenever he felt like painting. He tried to
   shew gratitude for this willingness, but I thought I could detect a kind
   of contempt or even loathing beneath his careful politeness. For my part,
   I frankly hated Marceline! There was no use in calling my attitude
   anything as mild as dislike these days. Certainly, I was glad Denis was
   away. His letters, not nearly so frequent as I wished, shewed signs of
   strain and worry.

   "As the middle of August went by I gathered from Marsh's remarks that the
   portrait was nearly done. His mood seemed increasingly sardonic, though
   Marceline's temper improved a bit as the prospect of seeing the thing
   tickled her vanity. I can still recall the day when Marsh said he'd have
   everything finished within a week. Marceline brightened up perceptibly,
   though not without a venomous look at me. It seemed as if her coiled hair
   visibly tightened around her head.

   "'I'm to be the first to see it!' she snapped. Then, smiling at Marsh, she
   said, 'And if I don't like it I shall slash it to pieces!'

   "Marsh's face took on the most curious look I have ever seen it wear as he
   answered her.

   "'I can't vouch for your taste, Marceline, but I swear it will be
   magnificent! Not that I want to take much credit - art creates itself -
   and this thing had to be done. Just wait!'

   "During the next few days I felt a queer sense of foreboding, as if the
   completion of the picture meant a kind of catastrophe instead of a relief.
   Denis, too, had not written me, and my agent in New York said he was
   planning some trip to the country. I wondered what the outcome of the
   whole thing would be. What a queer mixture of elements - Marsh and
   Marceline, Denis and I! How would all these ultimately react on one
   another? When my fears grew too great I tried to lay them all to my
   infirmity, but that explanation never quite satisfied me."

                                       IV

   "Well, the thing exploded on Tuesday, the twenty-sixth of August. I had
   risen at my usual time and had breakfast, but was not good for much
   because of the pain in my spine. It had been troubling me badly of late,
   and forcing me to take opiates when it got too unbearable; nobody else was
   downstairs except the servants, though I could hear Marceline moving about
   in her room. Marsh slept in the attic next his studio, and had begun to
   keep such late hours that he was seldom up till noon. About ten o'clock
   the pain got the better of me, so that I took a double dose of my opiate
   and lay down on the parlour sofa. The last I heard was Marceline's pacing
   overhead. Poor creature - if I had known! She must have been walking
   before the long mirror admiring herself. That was like her. Vain from
   start to finish - revelling in her own beauty, just as she revelled in all
   the little luxuries Denis was able to give her.

   "I didn't wake up till near sunset, and knew instantly how long I had
   slept from the golden light and long shadows outside the long window.
   Nobody was about, and a sort of unnatural stillness seemed to be hovering
   over everything. From afar, though, I thought I could sense a faint
   howling, wild and intermittent, whose quality had a slight but baffling
   familiarity about it. I'm not much for psychic premonitions, but I was
   frightfully uneasy from the start. There had been dreams - even worse than
   the ones I had been dreaming in the weeks before - and this time they
   seemed hideously linked to some black and festering reality. The whole
   place had a poisonous air. Afterward I reflected that certain sounds must
   have filtered through into my unconscious brain during those hours of
   drugged sleep. My pain, though, was very much eased; and I rose and walked
   without difficulty.

   "Soon enough I began to see that something was wrong. Marsh and Marceline
   might have been riding, but someone ought to have been getting dinner in
   the kitchen. Instead, there was only silence, except for that faint,
   distant howl or wail; and nobody answered when I pulled the old-fashioned
   bell-cord to summon Scipio. Then, chancing to look up, I saw the spreading
   stain on the ceiling - the bright re stain, that must have come through
   the floor of Marceline's room.

   "In an instant I forgot my crippled back and hurried upstairs to find out
   the worst. Everything under the sun raced through my mind as I struggled
   with the dampness-warped door of that silent chamber, and most hideous of
   all was a terrible sense of malign fulfilment and fatal expectedness. I
   had, it struck me, known all along that nameless horrors were gathering;
   that something profoundly and cosmically evil had gained a foot-hold under
   my roof from which only blood and tragedy could result.

   "The door gave at last, and I stumbled into the large room beyond - all
   dim from the branches of the great trees outside the windows. For a moment
   I could do nothing but flinch at the faint evil odour that immediately
   struck my nostrils. Then, turning on the electric light and glancing
   around, I glimpsed a nameless blasphemy on the yellow and blue rug.

   "It lay face down in a great pool of dark, thickened blood, and had the
   gory print of a shod human foot in the middle of its naked back. Blood was
   spattered everywhere - on the walls, furniture, and floor. My knees gave
   way as I took in the sight, so that I had to stumble to a chair and slump
   down. The thing had obviously been a human being, though its identity was
   not easy to establish at first; since it was without clothes, and had most
   of its hair hacked and torn from the scalp in a very crude way. It was of
   a deep ivory colour, and I knew that it must have been Marceline. The
   shoe-print on the back made the thing seem all the more hellish. I could
   not even picture the strange, loathsome tragedy which must have taken
   place while I slept in the room below. When I raised my hand to wipe my
   dripping forehead I saw that my fingers were sticky with blood. I
   shuddered, then realised that it must have come from the knob of the door
   which the unknown murderer had forced shut behind him as he left. He had
   taken his weapon with him, it seemed, for no instrument of death was
   visible here.

   "As I studied the floor I saw that a line of sticky footprints like the
   one on the body led away from the horror to the door. There was another
   blood-trail, too, and of a less easily explainable kind; a broadish,
   continuous line, as if marking the path of some huge snake. At first I
   concluded it must be due to something the murderer had dragged after him.
   Then, noting the way some of the footprints seemed to be superimposed on
   it, I was forced to believe that it could have been there when the
   murderer left. But what crawling entity could have been in that room with
   the victim and her assassin, leaving before the killer when the deed was
   done? As I asked myself this question I thought I heard fresh bursts of
   that faint, distant wailing.

   "Finally, rousing myself from a lethargy of horror, I got on my feet again
   and began following the footprints. Who the murderer was, I could not even
   faintly guess, nor could I try to explain the absence of the servants. I
   vaguely felt that I ought to go up to Marsh's attic quarters, but before I
   had fully formulated the idea I saw that the bloody trail was indeed
   taking me there. Was he himself the murderer? Had he gone mad under the
   strain of the morbid situation and suddenly run amok?

   "In the attic corridor the trail became faint, the prints almost ceasing
   as they merged with the dark carpet. I could still, however, discern the
   strange single path of the entity who had gone first; and this led
   straight to the closed door of Marsh's studio, disappearing beneath it at
   a point about half way from side to side. Evidently it had crossed the
   threshold at a time when the door was wide open.

   "Sick at heart, I tried the knob and found the door unlocked. Opening it,
   I paused in the waning north light to see what fresh nightmare might be
   awaiting me. There was certainly something human on the floor, and I
   reached for the switch to turn on the chandelier.

   "But as the light flashed up my gaze left the floor and its horror - that
   was Marsh, poor devil - to fix itself frantically and incredulously upon
   the living thing that cowered and stared in the open doorway leading to
   Marsh's bedroom. It was a tousled, wild-eyed thing, crusted with dried
   blood and carrying in its hand a wicked machete which had been one of the
   ornaments of the studio wall. Yet even in that awful moment I recognised
   it as one whom I had thought more than a thousand miles away. It was my
   own boy Denis - or the maddened wreck which had once been Denis.

   "The sight of me seemed to bring back a trifle of sanity - or at least of
   memory - in the poor boy. He straightened up and began to toss his head
   about as if trying to shake free from some enveloping influence. I could
   not speak a word, but moved my lips in an effort to get back my voice. My
   eyes wandered for a moment to the figure on the floor in front of the
   heavily draped easel - the figure toward which the strange blood-trail
   led, and which seemed to be tangled in the coils of some dark, ropy
   object. The shifting of my glance apparently produced some impression in
   the twisted brain of the boy, for suddenly he began to mutter in a hoarse
   whisper whose purport I was soon able to catch.

   "'I had to exterminate her - she was the devil - the summit and
   high-priestess of all evil - the spawn of the pit - Marsh knew, and tried
   to warn me. Good old Frank - I didn't kill him, though I was ready to
   before I realised. But I went down there and killed her - then that cursed
   hair - '

   "I listened in horror as Denis choked, paused, and began again.

   "'You didn't know - her letters got queer and I knew she was in love with
   Marsh. Then she nearly stopped writing. He never mentioned her - I felt
   something was wrong, and thought I ought to come back and find out.
   Couldn't tell you - your manner would have given it away. Wanted to
   surprise them. Got here about noon today - came in a cab and sent the
   house-servants all off - let the field hands alone, for their cabins are
   all out of earshot. Told McCabe to get me some things in Cape Girardeau
   and not bother to come back until tomorrow. Had all the niggers take the
   old car and let Mary drive them to Bend Village for a vacation - told 'em
   we were all going on some sort of outing and wouldn't need help. Said
   they'd better stay all night with Uncle Scip's cousin, who keeps that
   nigger boarding house.'

   "Denis was getting very incoherent now, and I strained my ears to grasp
   every word. Again I thought I heard that wild, far-off wail, but the story
   had first place for the present.

   "'Saw you sleeping in the parlour, and took a chance you wouldn't wake up.
   Then went upstairs on the quiet to hunt up Marsh and...that woman!'

   "The boy shuddered as he avoided pronouncing Marceline's name. At the same
   time I saw his eyes dilate in unison with a bursting of the distant
   crying, whose vague familiarity had now become very great.

   "'She was not in her room, so I went up to the studio. Door was shut, and
   I could hear voices inside. Didn't knock - just burst in and found her
   posing for the picture. Nude, but with the hellish hair all draped around
   her. And making all sorts of sheep's eyes at Marsh. He had the easel
   turned half away from the door, so I couldn't see the picture. Both of
   them were pretty well jolted when I shewed up, and Marsh dropped his
   brush. I was in a rage and told him he'd have to shew me the portrait, but
   he got calmer every minute. Told me it wasn't quite done, but would be in
   a day or two - said I could see it then - she - hadn't seen it.

   "'But that didn't go with me. I stepped up, and he dropped a velvet
   curtain over the thing before I could see it. He was ready to fight before
   letting me see it, but that - that - she - stepped up and sided with me.
   Said we ought to see it. Frank got horrible worked up, and gave me a punch
   when I tried to get at the punch when I tried to get at the curtain. I
   punched back and seemed to have knocked him out. Then I was almost knocked
   out myself by the shriek that - that creature - gave. She'd drawn aside
   the hangings herself, and caught a look at what Marsh had been painting. I
   wheeled around and saw her rushing like mad out of the room - then I saw
   the picture.'

   "Madness flared up in the boy's eyes again as he got to this place, and I
   thought for a minute he was going to spring at me with his machete. But
   after a pause he partly steadied himself.

   "'Oh, God - that thing! Don't ever look at it! Burn it with the hangings
   around it and throw the ashes into the river! Marsh knew - and was warning
   me. He knew what it was - what that woman - that leopardess, or gorgon, or
   lamia, or whatever she was - actually represented. He'd tried to hint to
   me ever since I met her in his Paris studio, but it couldn't be told in
   words. I thought they all wronged her when they whispered horrors about
   her - she had me hypnotised so that I couldn't believe the plain facts -
   but this picture has caught the whole secret - the whole monstrous
   background!

   "'God, but Frank is an artist! That thing is the greatest piece any living
   soul has produced since Rembrandt! It's a crime to burn it - but it would
   be a greater crime to let it exist - just as it would have been an
   abhorrent sin to let - that she-daemon - exist any longer. The minute I
   saw it I understood what - she - was, and what part she played in the
   frightful secret that has come down from the days of Cthulhu and the Elder
   Ones - the secret that was nearly wiped out when Atlantis sank, but that
   kept half alive in hidden traditions and allegorical myths and furtive,
   midnight cult-practices. For you know she was the real thing. It wasn't
   any fake. It would have been merciful if it had been a fake. It was the
   old, hideous shadow that philosophers never dared mention - the thing
   hinted at in the <i>Necronomicon</i> and symbolised in the Easter Island
   colossi.

   "'She thought we couldn't see through - that the false front would hold
   till we had bartered away our immortal souls. And she was half right -
   she'd have got me in the end. She was only - waiting. But Frank - good old
   Frank - was too much for me. <i>He knew what it all meant, and painted
   it.</i> I don't wonder she shrieked and ran off when she saw it. It wasn't
   quite done, but God knows <i>enough was there.</i>

   "'Then I knew I'd got to kill her - kill her, and everything connected
   with her. It was a taint that wholesome human blood couldn't bear. There
   was something else, too - but you'll never know that if you burn the
   picture without looking. I staggered down to her room with this machete
   that I got off the wall here, leaving Frank still knocked out. He was
   breathing, though, and I knew and thanked heaven I hadn't killed him.

   "'I found her in front of the mirror braiding that accursed hair. She
   turned on me like a wild beast, and began spitting out her hatred of
   Marsh. The fact that she'd been in love with him - and I knew she had -
   only made it worse. For a minute I couldn't move, and she came within an
   ace of completely hypnotising me. Then I thought of the picture, and the
   spell broke. She saw the breaking in my eyes, and must have noticed the
   machete, too. I never saw anything give such a wild jungle beast look as
   she did then. She sprang for me with claws out like a leopard's, but I was
   too quick. I swung the machete, and it was all over.'

   "Denis had to stop again, and I saw the perspiration running down his
   forehead through the spattered blood. But in a moment he hoarsely resumed.

   "'I said it was all over - but God! some of it had only just begun! I felt
   I had fought the legions of Satan, and put my foot on the back of the
   thing I had annihilated. <i>Then I saw that blasphemous braid of coarse
   black hair begin to twist and squirm of itself.</i>

   "'I might have known it. It was all in the old tales. That damnable hair
   had a life of its own, that couldn't be ended by killing the creature
   itself. I knew I'd have to burn it, so I started to hack it off with the
   machete. God, but it was devilish work! Tough - like iron wires - but I
   managed to do it. And it was loathsome the way the big braid writhed and
   struggled in my grasp.

   "'About the time I had the last strand cut or pulled off I heard that
   eldritch wailing from behind the house. You know - it's still going off
   and on. I don't know what it is, but it must be something springing from
   this hellish business. It half seems like something I ought to know but
   can't quite place. It got my nerves the first time I heard it, and I
   dropped the severed braid in my fright. Then, I got a worse fright - for
   in another second the braid had turned on me and began to strike
   venomously with one of its ends which had knotted itself up like a sort of
   grotesque head. I struck out with the machete, and it turned away. Then,
   when I had my breath again, I saw that the monstrous thing was crawling
   along the floor by itself like a great black snake. I couldn't do anything
   for a while, but when it vanished through the door I managed to pull
   myself together and stumble after it. I could follow the broad, bloody
   trail, and I saw it led upstairs. It brought me here - and may heaven
   curse me if I didn't see it through the doorway, striking at poor dazed
   Marsh like a maddened rattler as it had struck at me, finally coiling
   around him as a python would. He had begun to come to, but that abominable
   serpent got him before he was on his feet. I knew that all of the woman's
   hatred was behind it, but I hadn't the power to pull it off. I tried, but
   it was too much for me. Even the machete was no good - I couldn't swing it
   freely or it would have slashed Frank to pieces. So I saw those monstrous
   coils tighten - saw poor Frank crushed to death before my eyes - and all
   the time that awful faint howling came from somewhere beyond the fields.

   "'That's all. I pulled the velvet cloth over the picture and hope it'll
   never be lifted. The thing must be burnt. I couldn't pry the coils off
   poor, dead Frank - they cling to him like a leach, and seem to have lost
   their motion altogether. It's as if that snaky rope of hair has a kind of
   perverse fondness for the man it killed - it's clinging to him - embracing
   him. You'll have to burn poor Frank with it - but for God's sake don't
   forget to see it in ashes. That and the picture. They must both go. The
   safety of the world demands that they go.

   "Denis might have whispered more, but a fresh burst of distant wailing cut
   us short. For the first time we knew what it was, for a westerly veering
   wind brought articulate words at last. We ought to have known long before,
   since sounds much like it had often come from the same source. It was
   wrinkled Sophonisba, the ancient Zulu witch-woman who had fawned on
   Marceline, keening from her cabin in a way which crowned the horrors of
   this nightmare tragedy. We could both hear some of the things she howled,
   and knew that secret and primordial bonds linked this savage sorceress
   with that other inheritor of elder secrets who had just been extirpated.
   Some of the words she used betrayed her closeness to daemonic and
   palaeogean traditions.

   "'Ia:! Ia:! Shub-Niggurath! Ya-R'lyeh! N'gagi n'bulu bwana n'lolo! Ya, yo,
   poor Missy Tanit, poor Missy Isis! Marse Clooloo, come up outen de water
   an' git yo chile - she done daid! She done daid! De hair ain' got no
   missus no mo', Marse Clooloo. Ol' Sophy, she know! Ol' Sophy, she done got
   de black stone outen Big Zimbabwe in ol' Affriky! Ol' Sophy, she done
   dance in de moonshine roun' de crocodile-stone befo' de N'bangus cotch her
   and sell her to de ship folks! No mo' Tanit! No mo' Isis! No mo'
   witch-woman to keep de fire a-goin' in de big stone place! Ya, yo!
   <i>N'gagi n'bulu bwana n'lolo! Ia:! Shub-Niggurath!</i> She daid! Ol'
   Sophy know!'

   "That wasn't the end of the wailing, but it was all I could pay attention
   to. The expression on my boy's face shewed that it had reminded him of
   something frightful, and the tightening of his hand on the machete boded
   no good. I knew he was desperate, and sprang to disarm him before he could
   do anything more.

   "But I was too late. An old man with a bad spine doesn't count for much
   physically. There was a terrible struggle, but he had done for himself
   before many seconds were over. I'm not sure yet but that he tried to kill
   me, too. His last panting words were something about the need of wiping
   out everything that had been connected with Marceline, either by blood or
   marriage."

                                       V

   "I wonder to this day that I didn't go stark mad in that instant - or in
   the moments and hours afterward. In front of me was the slain body of my
   boy - the only human being I had to cherish - and ten feet away, in front
   of that shrouded easel, was the body of his best friend, with a nameless
   coil of horror wound around it. Below was the scalped corpse of that
   she-monster, about whom I was half-ready to believe anything. I was too
   dazed to analyse the probability of the hair story - and even if I had not
   been, that dismal howling coming from Aunt Sophy's cabin would have been
   enough to quiet doubt for the nonce.

   "If I'd been wise, I'd have done just what poor Denis told me to - burned
   the picture and the body-grasping hair at once and without curiosity - but
   I was too shaken to be wise. I suppose I muttered foolish things over my
   boy - and then I remembered that the night was wearing on and that the
   servants would be back in the morning. It was plain that a matter like
   this could never be explained, and I knew that I must cover things up and
   invent a story.

   "That coil of hair around Marsh was a monstrous thing. As I poked at it
   with a sword which I took from the wall I almost thought I felt it tighten
   its grip on the dead man. I didn't dare touch it - and the longer I looked
   at it the more horrible things I noticed about it. One thing gave me a
   start. I won't mention it - but it partly explained the need for feeding
   the hair with queer oils as Marceline had always done.

   "In the end I decided to bury all three bodies in the cellar - with
   quicklime, which I knew we had in the storehouse. It was a night of
   hellish work. I dug three graves - my boy's a long way from the other two,
   for I didn't want him to be near either the woman's body or her hair. I
   was sorry I couldn't get the coil from around poor marsh. It was terrible
   work getting them all down to the cellar. I used blankets in carting the
   woman and the poor devil with the coil around him. Then I had to get two
   barrels of lime from the storehouse. God must have given me strength, for
   I not only moved them but filled all three graves without a hitch.

   "Some of the lime I made into whitewash. I had to take a stepladder and
   fix over the parlour ceiling where the blood had oozed through. And I
   burned nearly everything in Marceline's room, scrubbing the walls and
   floor and heavy furniture. I washed up the attic studio, too, and the
   trail and footprints that led there. And all the time I could hear old
   Sophy's wailing in the distance. The devil must have been in that creature
   to let her voice go on like that. But she always was howling queer things.
   That's why the field niggers didn't get scared or curious that night. I
   locked the studio door and took the key to my room. Then I burned all my
   stained clothes in the fireplace. By dawn the whole house looked quite
   normal so far as any casual eye could tell. I hadn't dared touch the
   covered easel, but meant to attend to that later.

   "Well, the servants came back the next day, and I told them all the young
   folks had gone to St. Louis. None of the field hands seemed to have seen
   or heard anything, and old Sophonisba's wailing had stopped at the instant
   of sunrise. She was like a sphinx after that, and never let out a word of
   what had been on her brooding brain the day and night before.

   "Later on I pretended that Denis and Marsh and Marceline had gone back to
   Paris and had a certain discreet agency mail me letters from there -
   letters I had fixed up in forged handwriting. It took a good deal of
   deceit and reticence in several things to various friends, and I knew
   people have secretly suspected me of holding something back. I had the
   deaths of Marsh and Denis reported during the war, and later said
   Marceline had entered a convent. Fortunately Marsh was an orphan whose
   eccentric ways had alienated him from his people in Louisiana. Things
   might have been patched up a good deal better for me if I had had the
   sense to burn the picture, sell the plantation, and give up trying to
   manage things with a shaken and overstrained mind. You see what my folly
   has brought me to. Failing crops - hands discharged one by one - place
   falling apart to ruin - and myself a hermit and a target for dozens of
   queer countryside stories. Nobody will come around here after dark anymore
   - or any other time if it can be helped. That's why I knew you must be a
   stranger.

   "And why do I stay here? I can't wholly tell you that. It's bound up too
   closely with things at the very rim of sane reality. It wouldn't have been
   so, perhaps, if I hadn't looked at the picture. I ought to have done as
   poor Denis told me. I honestly meant to burn it when I went up to that
   locked studio a week after the horror, but I looked first - and that
   changed everything.

   "No - there's no use telling what I saw. You can, in a way, see for
   yourself presently; though time and dampness have done their work. I don't
   think it can hurt you if you want to take a look, but it was different
   with me. I knew too much of what it all meant.

   "Denis had been right - it was the greatest triumph of human art since
   Rembrandt, even though still unfinished. I grasped that at the start, and
   knew that poor Marsh had justified his decadent philosophy. He was to
   painting what Baudelaire was to poetry - and Marceline was the key that
   had unlocked his inmost stronghold of genius.

   "The thing almost stunned me when I pulled aside the hangings - stunned me
   before I half knew what the whole thing was. You know, it's only partly a
   portrait. Marsh had been pretty literal when he hinted that he wasn't
   painting Marceline alone, but what he saw through her and beyond her.

   "Of course she was in it - was the key to it, in a sense - but her figure
   only formed one point in a vast composition. She was nude except for that
   hideous web of hair spun around her, and was half-seated, half-reclining
   on a sort of bench or divan, carved in patterns unlike those of any known
   decorative tradition. There was a monstrously shaped goblet in one hand,
   from which was spilling fluid whose colour I haven't been able to place or
   classify to this day - I don't know where Marsh even got the pigments.

   "The figure and the divan were in the left-hand foreground of the
   strangest sort of scene I ever saw in my life. I think there was a faint
   suggestion of its all being a kind of emanation from the woman's brain,
   yet there was also a directly opposite suggestion - as if she were just an
   evil image or hallucination conjured up by the scene itself.

   "I can't tell you know whether it's an exterior or an interior - whether
   those hellish Cyclopean vaultings are seen from the outside or the inside,
   or whether they are indeed carven stone and not merely a morbid fungous
   arborescence. The geometry of the whole thing is crazy - one gets the
   acute and obtuse angles all mixed up.

   "And God! The shapes of nightmare that float around in that perpetual
   daemon twilight! The blasphemies that lurk and leer and hold a Witches'
   Sabbat with that woman as a high-priestess! The black shaggy entities that
   are not quite goats - the crocodile-headed beast with three legs and a
   dorsal row of tentacles - and the flat-nosed aegipans dancing in a pattern
   that Egypt's priests knew and called accursed!

   "But the scene wasn't Egypt - it was behind Egypt; behind even Atlantis;
   behind fabled Mu, and myth-whispered Lemuria. It was the ultimate
   fountainhead of all horror on this earth, and the symbolism shewed only
   too clearly how integral a part of it Marceline was. I think it must be
   the unmentionable R'lyeh, that was not built by any creatures of this
   planet - the thing Marsh and Denis used to talk about in the shadows with
   hushed voices. In the picture it appears that the whole scene is deep
   under water - though everybody seems to be breathing freely.

   "Well - I couldn't do anything but look and shudder, and finally I saw
   that Marceline was watching me craftily out of those monstrous, dilated
   eyes on the canvas. It was no mere superstition - Marsh had actually
   caught something of her horrible vitality in his symphonies of line and
   color, so that she still brooded and hated, just as if most of her weren't
   down in the cellar under quicklime. <i>And it was worst of al when some of
   those Hecate-born snaky strands of hair began to lift themselves up from
   the surface and grope out into the room toward me.</i>

   "Then it was that I knew the last final horror, and realised I was a
   guardian and a prisoner forever. she was the thing from which the first
   dim legends of Medusa and the Gorgons had sprung, and something in my
   shaken will had been captured and turned to stone at last. Never again
   would I be safe from those coiling snaky strands - the strands in the
   picture, and those that lay brooding under the lime near the wine casks.
   All too late I recalled the tales of the virtual indestructibility, even
   through centuries of burial, of the hair of the dead.

   "My life since has been nothing but horror and slavery. Always there had
   lurked the fear of what broods down in the cellar. In less than a month
   the niggers began whispering about the great black snake that crawled
   around near the wine casks after dark, and about the curious way its trail
   would lead to another spot six feet away. Finally I had to move everything
   to another part of the cellar, for not a darky could be induced to go near
   the place where the snake was seen.

   "Then the field hands began talking about the black snake that visited old
   Sophonisba's cabin every night after midnight. One of them shewed me its
   trail - and not long afterward I found out that Aunt Sophy herself had
   begun to pay strange visits to the cellar of the big house, lingering and
   muttering for hours in the very spot where none of the other blacks would
   go near. God, but I was glad when that old witch died! I honestly believe
   she had been a priestess of some ancient and terrible tradition back in
   Africa. She must have lived to be almost a hundred and fifty years old.

   "Sometimes I think I hear something gliding around the house at night.
   There will be a queer noise on the stairs, where the boards are loose, and
   the latch of my room will rattle as if with an inward pressure. I always
   keep my door locked, of course. Then there are certain mornings when I
   seem to catch a sickish musty odour in the corridors, and notice a faint,
   ropy trail through the dust of the floors. I know I must guard the hair in
   the picture, for if anything were to happen to it, there are entities in
   this house which would take a sure and terrible revenge. I don't even dare
   to die - for life and death are all one to those in the clutch of what
   came out of R'lyeh. Something would be on hand to punish my neglect.
   Medusa's coil has got me, and it will always be the same. Never mix up
   with secret and ultimate horror, young man, if you value your immortal
   soul."

                                       VI

   As the old man finished his story I saw that the small lamp had long since
   burned dry, and that the large one was nearly empty. It must, I knew, be
   near dawn, and my ears told me that the storm was over. The tale had held
   me in a half-daze, and I almost feared to glance at the door lest it
   reveal an inward pressure from some unnamable source. It would be hard to
   say which had the greatest hold on me - stark horror, incredulity, or a
   kind of morbid fantastic curiosity. I was wholly beyond speech and had to
   wait for my strange host to break the spell.

   "Do you want to see - the thing?"

   His voice was low and hesitant, and I saw he was tremendously in earnest.
   Of my various emotions, curiosity gained the upper hand; and I nodded
   silently. He rose, lighting a candle on a nearby table and holding it high
   before him as he opened the door.

   "Come with me - upstairs."

   I dreaded to brave those musty corridors again, but fascination downed all
   my qualms. The boards creaked beneath our feet, and I trembled once when I
   thought I saw a faint, rope-like line trace in the dust near the
   staircase.

   The steps of the attic were noisy and rickety, with several of the treads
   missing. I was just glad of the need of looking sharply to my footing, for
   it gave me an excuse not to glance about. The attic corridor was
   pitch-black and heavily cobwebbed, and inch-deep with dust except where a
   beaten trail led to a door on the left at the farther end. As I noticed
   the rotting remains of a thick carpet I thought of the other feet which
   had pressed it in bygone decades - of these, and of one thing which did
   not have feet.

   The old man took me straight to the door at the end of the beaten path,
   and fumbled a second with the rusty latch. I was acutely frightened know
   that I knew the picture was so close, yet dared not retreat at this stage.
   In another moment my host was ushering me into the deserted studio.

   The candle light was very faint, yet served to shew most of the principal
   features. I noticed the low, slanting roof, the huge enlarged dormer, the
   curios and trophies hung on the wall - and most of all, the great shrouded
   easel in the centre of the floor. To that easel de Russy now walked,
   drawing aside the dusty velvet hangings on the side turned away from me,
   and motioning me silently to approach. It took a good deal of courage to
   make me obey, especially when I saw how my guide's eyes dilated in the
   wavering candle light as he looked at the unveiled canvas. But again
   curiosity conquered everything, and I walked around to where de Russy
   stood. Then I saw the damnable thing.

   I did not faint - though no reader can possibly realise the effort it took
   to keep me from doing so. I did cry out, but stopped short when I saw the
   frightened look on the old man's face. as I had expected, the canvas was
   warped, mouldy, and scabrous from dampness and neglect; but for all that I
   could trace the monstrous hints of evil cosmic outsideness that lurked all
   through the nameless scene's morbid content and perverted geometry.

   It was as the old man had said - a vaulted, columned hell of mungled Black
   Masses and Witches' Sabbaths - and what perfect completion could have
   added to it was beyond my power to guess. Decay had only increased the
   utter hideousness of its wicked symbolism and diseased suggestion, for the
   parts most affected by time were just those parts of the picture which in
   Nature - or in the extra-cosmic realm that mocked Nature - would be apt to
   decay and disintegrate.

   The utmost horror of all, of course, was Marceline - and as I saw the
   bloated, discoloured flesh I formed the odd fancy that perhaps the figure
   on the canvas had some obscure, occult linkage with the figure which lay
   in quicklime under the cellar floor. Perhaps the lime had preserved the
   corpse instead of destroying it - but could it have preserved those black,
   malign eyes that glared and mocked at me from their painted hell?

   And there was something else about the creature which I could not fail to
   notice - something which de Russy had not been able to put into words, but
   which perhaps had something to do with Denis' wish to kill all those of
   his blood who had dwelt under the same roof with her. Whether Marsh knew,
   or whether the genius in him painted it without his knowing, none could
   say. But Denis and his father could not have known till they saw the
   picture.

   Surpassing all in horror was the streaming black hair - which covered the
   rotting body, but which was itself not even slightly decayed. All I had
   heard of it was amply verified. It was nothing human, this ropy, sinuous,
   half-oily, half-crinkly flood of serpent darkness. Vile, independent life
   proclaimed itself at every unnatural twist and convolution, and the
   suggestion of numberless <i>reptilian heads</i> at the out-turned ends was
   far too marked to be illusory or accidental.

   The blasphemous thing held me like a magnet. I was helpless, and did not
   wonder at the myth of the gorgon's glance which turned all beholders to
   stone. Then I thought I saw a change come over the thing. The leering
   features perceptibly moved, so that the rotting jaw fell, allowing the
   thick, beast-like lips to disclose a row of pointed yellow fangs. The
   pupils of the fiendish eyes dilated, and the eyes themselves seemed to
   bulge outward. And the hair - that accursed hair! <i>It had begun to
   rustle and wave perceptibly, the snake-heads all turning toward de Russy
   and vibrating as if to strike!</i>

   Reason deserted me altogether, and before I knew what I was doing I drew
   my automatic and sent a shower of twelve steel-jacketed bullets through
   the shocking canvas. The whole thing at once fell to pieces, even the
   frame toppling from the easel and clattering to the dust-covered floor.
   But though this horror was shattered, another had risen before me in the
   form of de Russy himself, whose maddened shrieks as he saw the picture
   vanish were almost as terrible as the picture itself had been.

   With a half-articulate scream of "God, now you've done it!" the frantic
   old man seized me violently by the arm and commenced to drag me out of the
   room and down the rickety stairs. He had dropped the candle in his panic;
   but dawn was near, and some faint grey light was filtering in through the
   dust-covered windows. I tripped and stumbled repeatedly, but never for a
   moment would my guide slacken his pace.

   "Run!" he shrieked, "run for your life! You don't know what you've done! I
   never told you the whole thing! There were things I had to do - <i>the
   picture talked to me and told me.</i> I had to guard and keep it - now the
   worst will happen! <i>She and that hair will come up out of their graves,
   for God knows what purpose!</i>

   "Hurry, man! For God's sake let's get out of here while there's time. If
   you have a car take me along to Cape Girardeau with you. It may well get
   me in the end, anywhere, but I'll give it a run for its money. Out of here
   - quick!"

   As we reached the ground floor I became aware of a slow, curious thumping
   from the rear of the house, followed by a sound of a door shutting. De
   Russy had not heard the thumping, but the other noise caught his ear and
   drew from him the most terrible shriek that ever sounded in human throat.

   "Oh, God - great God - that was the cellar door - she's coming - "

   By this time I was desperately wrestling with the rusty latch and sagging
   hinges of the great front door - almost as frantic as my host now that I
   heard the slow, thumping tread approaching from the unknown rear rooms of
   the accursed mansion. The night's rain had warped the oaken planks, and
   the heavy door stuck and resisted even more strongly than it had when I
   forced an entrance the evening before.

   Somewhere a plank creaked beneath the foot of whatever was walking, and
   the sound seemed to snap the last cord of sanity in the poor old man. With
   a roar like that of a maddened bull he released his grip on me and made a
   plunge to the right, through the open door of a room which I judged had
   been a parlour. A second later, just as I got the front door open and was
   making my own escape, I heard the tinkling clatter of broken glass and
   knew he had leapt through a window. And as I bounded off the sagging porch
   to commence my mad race down the long, weed-grown drive I thought I could
   catch the thud of dead, dogged footsteps which did not follow me, but
   which kept leadenly on through the door of the cobwebbed parlour.

   I looked backward only twice as I plunged heedlessly through the burrs and
   briers of that abandoned drive, past the dying lindens and grotesque
   scrub-oaks, in the grey pallor of a cloudy November dawn. The first time
   was when an acrid smell overtook me, and I thought of the candle de Russy
   had dropped in the attic studio. By then I was comfortably near the road,
   on the high place from which the roof of the distant house was clearly
   visible above its encircling trees; and just as I expected, thick clouds
   of smoke were billowing out of the attic dormers and curling upward into
   the leaden heavens. I thanked the powers of creation that an immemorial
   curse was about to be purged by fire and blotted from the earth.

   But in the next instant came that second backward look in which I glimpsed
   two other things - things that cancelled most of the relief and gave me a
   supreme shock from which I shall never recover. I have said that I was on
   a high part of the drive, from which much of the plantation behind me was
   visible. This vista included not only the house and its trees but some of
   the abandoned and partly flooded land beside the river, and several bends
   of the weed-choked drive I had been so hastily traversing. In both of
   these latter places I I now beheld sights - or suspicions of sights -
   which I wish devoutly I could deny.

   It was a faint, distant scream which made me turn back again, and as I did
   so I caught a trace of motion on the dull grey marshy plain behind the
   house. At that human figures are very small, yet I thought the motion
   resolved itself into two of these - pursuer and pursued. I even thought I
   saw the dark-clothed leading figure overtaken, seized, and dragged
   violently in the direction of the now burning house.

   But I could not watch the outcome, for at once a nearer sight obtruded
   itself - a suggestion of motion among the underbrush at a point some
   distance back along the deserted drive. <i>Unmistakably, the weeds and
   bushes and briers were swaying as no wind could sway them; swaying as if
   some large, swift serpent were wriggling purposefully along on the ground
   in pursuit of me.</i>

   That was all I could stand. I scrambled along madly for the gate, heedless
   of torn clothing and bleeding scratches, and jumped into the roadster
   parked under the great evergreen tree. It was a bedraggled, rain-drenched
   sight; but the works were unharmed and I had no trouble in starting the
   thing. I went on blindly in the direction the car was headed for; nothing
   was in my mind but to get away from that frightful region of nightmares
   and cacodaemons - to get away as quickly and as far as gasoline could take
   me.

   About three or four miles along the road a farmer hailed me - a kindly,
   drawling fellow of middle age and considerable native intelligence. I was
   glad to slow down and ask directions, though I knew I must present a
   strange enough aspect. The man readily told me the way to Cape Girardeau,
   and inquired where I had come from in such a state at such an early hour.
   Thinking it best to say little, I merely mentioned that I had been caught
   in the night's rain and had taken shelter at a nearby farmhouse, afterward
   losing my way in the underbrush trying to find my car.

   "At a farmhouse, eh? Wonder whose it could'a been. Ain't nothin' standin'
   this side o' Jim Ferris' place acrost Barker's Crick, an' that's all o'
   twenty miles by the rud."

   I gave a start, and wondered what fresh mystery this portended. Then I
   asked my informant if he had overlooked the large ruined plantation house
   whose ancient gate bordered the road not far back.

   "Funny ye sh'd recolleck that, stranger! Must a ben here afore some time.
   But that house ain't here now. Burnt down five or six years ago - and they
   did tell some queer stories about it."

   I shuddered.

   "You mean Riverside - ol' man de Russy's place. Queer goin's on there
   fifteen or twenty years ago. Ol' man's boy married a gal from abroad, and
   some folks thought she was a mighty odd sort. Didn't like the looks of
   her. then she and the boy went off sudden, and later on the ol' man said
   he was kilt in the war. But some o' the niggers hinted queer things. Got
   around at last that the ol' fellow fell in love with the gal himself and
   kilt her and the boy. That place was sure enough haunted by a black snake,
   mean that what it may.

   "Then five or six years ago the ol' man disappeared and the house burned
   down. Some do say he was burnt up in it. It was a mornin' after a rainy
   night just like this, when lots o' folks heard an awful yellin' across the
   fields in old de Russy's voice. When they stopped and looked, they see the
   house goin' up in smoke quick as a wink - that place was all like tinder
   anyhow, rain or no rain. Nobody never seen the ol' man again, but onct in
   a while they tell of the ghost of that big black snake glidin' aroun'.

   "What d'ye make of it, anyhow? You seem to hev knowed the place. Didn't ye
   ever hear tell of the de Russys? What d'ye reckon was the trouble with
   that gal young Denis married? She kinder made everybody shiver and feel
   hateful, though ye' couldn't never tell why."

   I was trying to think, but that process was almost beyond me now. The
   house burned down years ago? Then where, and under what conditions, had I
   passed the night? And why did I know what I knew of these things? Even as
   I pondered I saw a hair on my coat sleeve - the short, grey hair of an old
   man.

   In the end I drove on without telling anything. But did I hint that gossip
   was wronging the poor old planter who had suffered so much. I made it
   clear - as if from distant but authentic reports wafted among friends -
   that if anyone was to blame for the trouble at Riverside it was the woman,
   Marceline. She was not suited to Missouri ways, I said, and it was too bad
   that Denis had ever married her.

   More I did not intimate, for I felt that the de Russys, with their proudly
   cherished honour and high, sensitive spirits, would not wish me to say
   more. They had borne enough, God knows, without the countryside guessing
   what a daemon of the pit - what a gorgon of the elder blasphemies - had
   come to flaunt their ancient and stainless name.

   Nor was it right that the neighbours should know that other horror which
   my strange host of the night could not bring himself to tell me - that
   horror which he must have learned, as I learned it, from details in the
   lost masterpiece of poor Frank Marsh.

   It would be too hideous if they knew that the one-time heiress of
   Riverside - the accursed gorgon or lamia whose hateful crinkly coil of
   serpent-hair must even now be brooding and twining vampirically around an
   artist's skeleton in a lime-packed grave beneath a charred foundation -
   was faintly, subtly, yet to the eyes of genius unmistakably the scion of
   Zimbabwe's most primal grovellers. No wonder she owned a link with that
   old witch-woman - for, though in deceitfully slight proportion, Marceline
   was a negress.
