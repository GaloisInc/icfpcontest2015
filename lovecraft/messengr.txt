The Messenger

  by H.P. Lovecraft

              The thing, he said, would come in the night at three 
              From the old churchyard on the hill below;           
              But crouching by an oak fire's wholesome glow,       
              I tried to tell myself it could not be.              
                                                                   
              Surely, I mused, it was pleasantry                   
              Devised by one who did not truly know                
              The Elder Sign, bequeathed from long ago,            
              That sets the fumbling forms of darkness free.       
                                                                   
              He had not meant it - no - but still I lit           
              Another lamp as starry Leo climbed                   
              Out of the Seekonk, and a steeple chimed             
              Three - and the firelight faded, bit by bit.         
                                                                   
              Then at the door that cautious rattling came -       
              And the mad truth devoured me like a flame!

   This was written in response to Bertrand Kelton Hart, author of a daily
   column called "The Sideshow" in the Providence Journal, who, upon
   discovering that Wilcox's residence in "The Call of Cthulhu" (7 Thomas
   Street) was his own, published in his column "...I shall not be happy
   until, joining league with wraiths and ghouls, I have plumped down at
   least one large and abiding ghost by way of reprisal upon [Lovecraft's]
   own doorstep in Barnes street... I think I shall teach it to moan in a
   minor dissonance every morning at 3 o'clock sharp, with a clinking of
   chains."
