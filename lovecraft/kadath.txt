   Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvelous city, and three times
   was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it.
   All golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset, with walls, temples,
   colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble, silver-basined fountains
   of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens, and wide streets
   marching between delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and ivory statues
   in gleaming rows; while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red
   roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles. It
   was a fever of the gods, a fanfare of supernal trumpets and a clash of
   immortal cymbals. Mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous
   unvisited mountain; and as Carter stood breathless and expectant on that
   balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of
   almost-vanished memory, the pain of lost things and the maddening need to
   place again what once had been an awesome and momentous place.

   He knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme; though in
   what cycle or incarnation he had known it, or whether in dream or in
   waking, he could not tell. Vaguely it called up glimpses of a far
   forgotten first youth, when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery of
   days, and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetic to the eager sound of
   lutes and song, unclosing fiery gates toward further and surprising
   marvels. But each night as he stood on that high marble terrace with the
   curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that hushed sunset city
   of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the bondage of dream's tyrannous
   gods; for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot, or descend the wide
   marmoreal fights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder
   witchery lay outspread and beckoning.

   When for the third time he awakened with those flights still undescended
   and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed, he prayed long and
   earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the
   clouds on unknown Kadath, in the cold waste where no man treads. But the
   gods made no answer and shewed no relenting, nor did they give any
   favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream, and invoked them
   sacrificially through the bearded priests of Nasht and Kaman-Thah, whose
   cavern-temple with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of the
   waking world. It seemed, however, that his prayers must have been
   adversely heard, for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to
   behold the marvellous city; as if his three glimpses from afar had been
   mere accidents or oversights, and against some hidden plan or wish of the
   gods.

   At length, sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and
   cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs, nor able sleeping or
   waking to drive them from his mind, Carter resolved to go with bold
   entreaty whither no man had gone before, and dare the icy deserts through
   the dark to where unknown Kadath, veiled in cloud and crowned with
   unimagined stars, holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the Great
   Ones.

   In light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame and
   talked of this design to the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah. And the
   priests shook their pshent-bearing heads and vowed it would be the death
   of his soul. They pointed out that the Great Ones had shown already their
   wish, and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed by insistent
   pleas. They reminded him, too, that not only had no man ever been to
   Kadath, but no man had ever suspected in what part of space it may lie;
   whether it be in the dreamlands around our own world, or in those
   surrounding some unguessed companion of Fomalhaut or Aldebaran. If in our
   dreamland, it might conceivably be reached, but only three human souls
   since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious gulfs to
   other dreamlands, and of that three, two had come back quite mad. There
   were, in such voyages, incalculable local dangers; as well as that
   shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered
   universe, where no dreams reach; that last amorphous blight of nethermost
   confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity - the
   boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and
   who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time amidst
   the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin, monotonous
   whine of accursed flutes; to which detestable pounding and piping dance
   slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic Ultimate gods, the blind,
   voiceless, tenebrous, mindless Other gods whose soul and messenger is the
   crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.

   Of these things was Carter warned by the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in
   the cavern of flame, but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown
   Kadath in the cold waste, wherever that might be, and to win from them the
   sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city. He knew
   that his journey would be strange and long, and that the Great Ones would
   be against it; but being old in the land of dream he counted on many
   useful memories and devices to aid him. So asking a formal blessing of the
   priests and thinking shrewdly on his course, he boldly descended the seven
   hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber and set out through the
   Enchanted Wood.

   In the tunnels of that twisted wood, whose low prodigious oaks twine
   groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi,
   dwell the furtive and secretive Zoogs; who know many obscure secrets of
   the dream world and a few of the waking world, since the wood at two
   places touches the lands of men, though it would be disastrous to say
   where. Certain unexplained rumours, events, and vanishments occur among
   men where the Zoogs have access, and it is well that they cannot travel
   far outside the world of dreams. But over the nearer parts of the dream
   world they pass freely, flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing
   back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the forest
   they love. Most of them live in burrows, but some inhabit the trunks of
   the great trees; and although they live mostly on fungi it is muttered
   that they have also a slight taste for meat, either physical or spiritual,
   for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who have not come out.
   Carter, however, had no fear; for he was an old dreamer and had learnt
   their fluttering language and made many a treaty with them; having found
   through their help the splendid city of Celephais in Ooth-Nargai beyond
   the Tanarian Hills, where reigns half the year the great King Kuranes, a
   man he had known by another name in life. Kuranes was the one soul who had
   been to the star-gulls and returned free from madness.

   Threading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic trunks,
   Carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the Zoogs, and listened now
   and then for responses. He remembered one particular village of the
   creatures was in the centre of the wood, where a circle of great mossy
   stones in what was once a cleaning tells of older and more terrible
   dwellers long forgotten, and toward this spot he hastened. He traced his
   way by the grotesque fungi, which always seem better nourished as one
   approaches the dread circle where elder beings danced and sacrificed.
   Finally the great light of those thicker fungi revealed a sinister green
   and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the forest and out of
   sight. This was the nearest of the great ring of stones, and Carter knew
   he was close to the Zoog village. Renewing his fluttering sound, he waited
   patiently; and was at last rewarded by an impression of many eyes watching
   him. It was the Zoogs, for one sees their weird eyes long before one can
   discern their small, slippery brown outlines.

   Out they swarmed, from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree, till the whole
   dim-litten region was alive with them. Some of the wilder ones brushed
   Carter unpleasantly, and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear; but these
   lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders. The Council of
   Sages, recognizing the visitor, offered a gourd of fermented sap from a
   haunted tree unlike the others, which had grown from a seed dropt down by
   someone on the moon; and as Carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange
   colloquy began. The Zoogs did not, unfortunately, know where the peak of
   Kadath lies, nor could they even say whether the cold waste is in our
   dream world or in another. Rumours of the Great Ones came equally from all
   points; and one might only say that they were likelier to be seen on high
   mountain peaks than in valleys, since on such peaks they dance
   reminiscently when the moon is above and the clouds beneath.

   Then one very ancient Zoog recalled a thing unheard-of by the others; and
   said that in Ulthar, beyond the River Skai, there still lingered the last
   copy of those inconceivably old Pnakotic Manuscripts made by waking men in
   forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when the hairy
   cannibal Gnophkehs overcame many-templed Olathoe and slew all the heroes
   of the land of Lomar. Those manuscripts he said, told much of the gods,
   and besides, in Ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods,
   and even one old priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them
   dancing by moonlight. He had failed, though his companion had succeeded
   and perished namelessly.

   So Randolph Carter thanked the Zoogs, who fluttered amicably and gave him
   another gourd of moon-tree wine to take with him, and set out through the
   phosphorescent wood for the other side, where the rushing Skai flows down
   from the slopes of Lerion, and Hatheg and Nir and Ulthar dot the plain.
   Behind him, furtive and unseen, crept several of the curious Zoogs; for
   they wished to learn what might befall him, and bear back the legend to
   their people. The vast oaks grew thicker as he pushed on beyond the
   village, and he looked sharply for a certain spot where they would thin
   somewhat, standing quite dead or dying among the unnaturally dense fungi
   and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their fallen brothers. There he
   would turn sharply aside, for at that spot a mighty slab of stone rests on
   the forest floor; and those who have dared approach it say that it bears
   an iron ring three feet wide. Remembering the archaic circle of great
   mossy rocks, and what it was possibly set up for, the Zoogs do not pause
   near that expansive slab with its huge ring; for they realise that all
   which is forgotten need not necessarily be dead, and they would not like
   to see the slab rise slowly and deliberately.

   Carter detoured at the proper place, and heard behind him the frightened
   fluttering of some of the more timid Zoogs. He had known they would follow
   him, so he was not disturbed; for one grows accustomed to the anomalies of
   these prying creatures. It was twilight when he came to the edge of the
   wood, and the strengthening glow told him it was the twilight of morning.
   Over fertile plains rolling down to the Skai he saw the smoke of cottage
   chimneys, and on every hand were the hedges and ploughed fields and
   thatched roofs of a peaceful land. Once he stopped at a farmhouse well for
   a cup of water, and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous
   Zoogs that crept through the grass behind. At another house, where people
   were stirring, he asked questions about the gods, and whether they danced
   often upon Lerion; but the farmer and his wife would only make the Elder
   Sign and tell him the way to Nir and Ulthar.

   At noon he walked through the one broad high street of Nir, which he had
   once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this
   direction; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the
   Skai, into whose central piece the masons had sealed a living human
   sacrifice when they built it thirteen-hundred years before. Once on the
   other side, the frequent presence of cats (who all arched their backs at
   the trailing Zoogs) revealed the near neighborhood of Ulthar; for in
   Ulthar, according to an ancient and significant law, no man may kill a
   cat. Very pleasant were the suburbs of Ulthar, with their little green
   cottages and neatly fenced farms; and still pleasanter was the quaint town
   itself, with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and
   numberless chimney-pots and narrow hill streets where one can see old
   cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough. Carter, the cats
   being somewhat dispersed by the half-seen Zoogs, picked his way directly
   to the modest Temple of the Elder Ones where the priests and old records
   were said to be; and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied
   stone - which crowns Ulthar's highest hill - he sought out the patriarch
   Atal, who had been up the forbidden peak Hatheg-Kia in the stony desert
   and had come down again alive.

   Atal, seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the
   temple, was fully three centuries old; but still very keen of mind and
   memory. From him Carter learned many things about the gods, but mainly
   that they are indeed only Earth's gods, ruling feebly our own dreamland
   and having no power or habitation elsewhere. They might, Atal said, heed a
   man's prayer if in good humour; but one must not think of climbing to
   their onyx stronghold atop Kadath in the cold waste. It was lucky that no
   man knew where Kadath towers, for the fruits of ascending it would be very
   grave. Atal's companion Barzai the Wise had been drawn screaming into the
   sky for climbing merely the known peak of Hatheg-Kia. With unknown Kadath,
   if ever found, matters would be much worse; for although Earth's gods may
   sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal, they are protected by the Other
   Gods from Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. At least twice in the
   world's history the Other Gods set their seal upon Earth's primal granite;
   once in antediluvian times, as guessed from a drawing in those parts of
   the Pnakotic Manuscripts too ancient to be read, and once on Hatheg-Kia
   when Barzai the Wise tried to see Earth's gods dancing by moonlight. So,
   Atal said, it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful
   prayers.

   Carter, though disappointed by Atal's discouraging advice and by the
   meagre help to be found in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Seven
   Cryptical Books of Hsan, did not wholly despair. First he questioned the
   old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed terrace,
   thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods' aid; but Atal
   could tell him nothing. Probably, Atal said, the place belonged to his
   especial dream world and not to the general land of vision that many know;
   and conceivably it might be on another planet. In that case Earth's gods
   could not guide him if they would. But this was not likely, since the
   stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the
   Great Ones wished to hide from him.

   Then Carter did a wicked thing, offering his guileless host so many
   draughts of the moon-wine which the Zoogs had given him that the old man
   became irresponsibly talkative. Robbed of his reserve, poor Atal babbled
   freely of forbidden things; telling of a great image reported by
   travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain Ngranek, on the
   isle of Oriab in the Southern Sea, and hinting that it may be a likeness
   which Earth's gods once wrought of their own features in the days when
   they danced by moonlight on that mountain. And he hiccoughed likewise that
   the features of that image are very strange, so that one might easily
   recognize them, and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of the
   gods.

   Now the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to
   Carter. It is known that in disguise the younger among the Great Ones
   often espouse the daughters of men, so that around the borders of the cold
   waste wherein stands Kadath the peasants must all bear their blood. This
   being so, the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on
   Ngranek and mark the features; then, having noted them with care, to
   search for such features among living men. Where they are plainest and
   thickest, there must the gods dwell nearest; and whatever stony waste lies
   back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands Kadath.

   Much of the Great Ones might be learnt in such regions, and those with
   their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker. They
   might not know their parentage, for the gods so dislike to be known among
   men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly; a thing
   which Carter realized even as he sought to scale Kadath. But they would
   have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows, and would sing
   of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in the dreamland that
   common folk would call them fools; and from all this one could perhaps
   learn old secrets of Kadath, or gain hints of the marvellous sunset city
   which the gods held secret. And more, one might in certain cases seize
   some well-loved child of a god as hostage; or even capture some young god
   himself, disguised and dwelling amongst men with a comely peasant maiden
   as his bride.

   Atal, however, did not know how to find Ngranek on its isle of Oriab; and
   recommended that Carter follow the singing Skai under its bridges down to
   the Southern Sea; where no burgess of Ulthar has ever been, but whence the
   merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and two-wheeled
   carts. There is a great city there, Dylath-Leen, but in Ulthar its
   reputation is bad because of the black three-banked galleys that sail to
   it with rubies from no clearly named shore. The traders that come from
   those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human, or nearly so, but the
   rowers are never beheld; and it is not thought wholesome in Ulthar that
   merchants should trade with black ships from unknown places whose rowers
   cannot be exhibited.

   By the time he had given this information Atal was very drowsy, and Carter
   laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long beard
   decorously on his chest. As he turned to go, he observed that no
   suppressed fluttering followed him, and wondered why the Zoogs had become
   so lax in their curious pursuit. Then he noticed all the sleek complacent
   cats of Ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto, and recalled the
   spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard, in lower parts of the
   temple while absorbed in the old priest's conversation. He recalled, too,
   the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent young Zoog had
   regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street outside. And because
   he loved nothing on earth more than small black kittens, he stooped and
   petted the sleek cats of Ulthar as they licked their chops, and did not
   mourn because those inquisitive Zoogs would escort him no farther.

   It was sunset now, so Carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little
   street overlooking the lower town. And as he went out on the balcony of
   his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and cobbled ways and
   the pleasant fields beyond, all mellow and magical in the slanted light,
   he swore that Ulthar would be a very likely place to dwell in always, were
   not the memory of a greater sunset city ever goading one onward toward
   unknown perils. Then twilight fell, and the pink walls of the plastered
   gables turned violet and mystic, and little yellow lights floated up one
   by one from old lattice windows. And sweet bells pealed in. the temple
   tower above, and the first star winked softly above the meadows across the
   Skai. With the night came song, and Carter nodded as the lutanists praised
   ancient days from beyond the filigreed balconies and tesselated courts of
   simple Ulthar. And there might have been sweetness even in the voices of
   Ulthar's many cats, but that they were mostly heavy and silent from
   strange feasting. Some of them stole off to those cryptical realms which
   are known only to cats and which villagers say are on the moon's dark
   side, whither the cats leap from tall housetops, but one small black
   kitten crept upstairs and sprang in Carter's lap to purr and play, and
   curled up near his feet when he lay down at last on the little couch whose
   pillows were stuffed with fragrant, drowsy herbs.

   In the morning Carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for Dylath-Leen
   with the spun wool of Ulthar and the cabbages of Ulthar's busy farms. And
   for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the smooth road beside the
   Skai; stopping some nights at the inns of little quaint fishing towns, and
   on other nights camping under the stars while snatches of boatmen's songs
   came from the placid river. The country was very beautiful, with green
   hedges and groves and picturesque peaked cottages and octagonal windmills.

   On the seventh day a blur of smoke rose on the horizon ahead, and then the
   tall black towers of Dylath-Leen, which is built mostly of basalt.
   Dylath-Leen with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a bit
   of the Giant's Causeway, and its streets are dark and uninviting. There
   are many dismal sea-taverns near the myriad wharves, and all the town is
   thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a few which
   are said to be not on earth. Carter questioned the oddly robed men of that
   city about the peak of Ngranek on the isle of Oriab, and found that they
   knew of it well.

   Ships came from Baharna on that island, one being due to return thither in
   only a month, and Ngranek is but two days' zebra-ride from that port. But
   few had seen the stone face of the god, because it is on a very difficult
   side of Ngranek, which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister
   lava. Once the gods were angered with men on that side, and spoke of the
   matter to the Other Gods.

   It was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in
   Dylath-Leen's sea taverns, because they mostly preferred to whisper of the
   black galleys. One of them was due in a week with rubies from its unknown
   shore, and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock. The mouths of the men who
   came from it to trade were too wide, and the way their turbans were humped
   up in two points above their foreheads was in especially bad taste. And
   their shoes were the shortest and queerest ever seen in the Six Kingdoms.
   But worst of all was the matter of the unseen rowers. Those three banks of
   oars moved too briskly and accurately and vigorously to be comfortable,
   and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for weeks while the
   merchants traded, yet to give no glimpse of its crew. It was not fair to
   the tavern-keepers of Dylath-Leen, or to the grocers and butchers, either;
   for not a scrap of provisions was ever sent aboard. The merchants took
   only gold and stout black slaves from Parg across the river. That was all
   they ever took, those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen
   rowers; never anything from the butchers and grocers, but only gold and
   the fat black men of Parg whom they bought by the pound. And the odours
   from those galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not
   to be described. Only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the
   hardiest denizen of the old sea-taverns bear them. Dylath-Leen would never
   have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable
   elsewhere, but no mine in all Barth's dreamland was known to produce their
   like.

   Of these things Dylath-Leen's cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst
   Carter waited patiently for the ship from Baharna, which might bear him to
   the isle whereon carven Ngranek towers lofty and barren. Meanwhile he did
   not fall to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales they
   might have concerning Kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of
   marble walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset. Of
   these things, however, he learned nothing; though he once thought that a
   certain old slant-eyed merchant looked queerly intelligent when the cold
   waste was spoken of. This man was reputed to trade with the horrible stone
   villages on the icy desert plateau of Leng, which no healthy folk visit
   and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar. He was even rumoured to
   have dealt with that High-Priest Not To Be Described, which wears a yellow
   silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone
   monastery. That such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with
   such beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be
   doubted, but Carter soon found that it was no use questioning him.

   Then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt wale and
   the tall lighthouse, silent and alien, and with a strange stench that the
   south wind drove into the town. Uneasiness rustled through the taverns
   along that waterfront, and after a while the dark wide-mouthed merchants
   with humped turbans and short feet clumped steathily ashore to seek the
   bazaars of the jewellers. Carter observed them closely, and disliked them
   more the longer he looked at them. Then he saw them drive the stout black
   men of Parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into that singular
   galley, and wondered in what lands - or if in any lands at all - those fat
   pathetic creatures might be destined to serve.

   And on the third evening of that galley's stay one of the uncomfortable
   merchants spoke to him, smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had heard
   in the taverns of Carter's quest. He appeared to have knowledge too secret
   for public telling; and although the sound of his voice was unbearably
   hateful, Carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must not be
   overlooked. He bade him therefore be his guest in locked chambers above,
   and drew out the last of the Zoogs' moon-wine to loosen his tongue. The
   strange merchant drank heavily, but smirked unchanged by the draught. Then
   he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his own, and Carter saw that
   the bottle was a single hollowed ruby, grotesquely carved in patterns too
   fabulous to be comprehended. He offered his wine to his host, and though
   Carter took only the least sip, he felt the dizziness of space and the
   fever of unimagined jungles. All the while the guest had been smiling more
   and more broadly, and as Carter slipped into blankness the last thing he
   saw was that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and something
   quite unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban
   had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirth.

   Carter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tent-like
   awning on the deck of a ship, with the marvellous coasts of the Southern
   Sea flying by in unnatural swiftness. He was not chained, but three of the
   dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby, and the sight of those
   humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that
   filtered up through the sinister hatches. He saw slip past him the
   glorious lands and cities of which a fellow-dreamer of earth - a
   lighthouse-keeper in ancient Kingsport - had often discoursed in the old
   days, and recognized the templed terraces of Zak, abode of forgotten
   dreams; the spires of infamous Thalarion, that daemon-city of a thousand
   wonders where the eidolon Lathi reigns; the charnel gardens of Zura, land
   of pleasures unattained, and the twin headlands of crystal, meeting above
   in a resplendent arch, which guard the harbour of Sona-Nyl, blessed land
   of fancy.

   Past all these gorgeous lands the malodourous ship flew unwholesomely,
   urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below. And before the
   day was done Carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than
   the Basalt Pillars of the West, beyond which simple folk say splendid
   Cathuria lies, but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a
   monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earth's dreamland drop wholly to
   abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds
   and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered universe where the
   daemon sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping
   and the hellish dancing of the Other Gods, blind, voiceless, tenebrous,
   and mindless, with their soul and messenger Nyarlathotep.

   Meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent,
   though Carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to
   hold him from his quest. It is understood in the land of dream that the
   Other Gods have many agents moving among men; and all these agents,
   whether wholly human or slightly less than human, are eager to work the
   will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their
   hideous soul and messenger, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. So Carter
   inferred that the merchants of the humped turbans, hearing of his daring
   search for the Great Ones in their castle of Kadath, had decided to take
   him away and deliver him to Nyarlathotep for whatever nameless bounty
   might be offered for such a prize. What might be the land of those
   merchants in our known universe or in the eldritch spaces outside, Carter
   could not guess; nor could he imagine at what hellish trysting-place they
   would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their reward. He
   knew, however, that no beings as nearly human as these would dare approach
   the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon Azathoth in the formless central
   void.

   At the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and
   glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some hidden
   and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates. Then they squatted
   close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat that was passed
   around. But when they gave Carter a portion, he found something very
   terrible in the size and shape of it; so that he turned even paler than
   before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye was on him. And
   again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath, and of the suspicious
   nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength was derived.

   It was dark when the galley passed betwixt the Basalt Pillars of the West
   and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from ahead. And
   the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars, and the deck grew
   damp, and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the brink. Then with
   a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken, and Carter felt the terrors
   of nightmare as earth fell away and the great boat shot silent and
   comet-like into planetary space. Never before had he known what shapeless
   black things lurk and caper and flounder all through the aether, leering
   and grinning at such voyagers as may pass, and sometimes feeling about
   with slimy paws when some moving object excites their curiosity. These are
   the nameless larvae of the Other Gods, and like them are blind and without
   mind, and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts.

   But that offensive galley did not aim as far as Carter had feared, for he
   soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon.
   The moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they approached it,
   and shewing its singular craters and peaks uncomfortably. The ship made
   for the edge, and it soon became clear that its destination was that
   secret and mysterious side which is always turned away from earth, and
   which no fully human person, save perhaps the dreamer Snireth-Ko, has ever
   beheld. The close aspect of the moon as the galley drew near proved very
   disturbing to Carter, and he did not like the size and shape of the ruins
   which crumbled here and there. The dead temples on the mountains were so
   placed that they could have glorified no suitable or wholesome gods, and
   in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to be some dark and
   inner meaning which did not invite solution. And what the structure and
   proportions of the olden worshippers could have been, Carter steadily
   refused to conjecture.

   When the ship rounded the edge, and sailed over those lands unseen by man,
   there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life, and Carter
   saw many low, broad, round cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi.
   He noticed that these cottages had no windows, and thought that their
   shape suggested the huts of Esquimaux. Then he glimpsed the oily waves of
   a sluggish sea, and knew that the voyage was once more to be by water - or
   at least through some liquid. The galley struck the surface with a
   peculiar sound, and the odd elastic way the waves received it was very
   perplexing to Carter.

   They now slid along at great speed, once passing and hailing another
   galley of kindred form, but generally seeing nothing but that curious sea
   and a sky that was black and star-strewn even though the sun shone
   scorchingly in it.

   There presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast,
   and Carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city. The way they
   leaned and bent, the manner in which they were clustered, and the fact
   that they had no windows at all, was very disturbing to the prisoner; and
   he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of
   that merchant with the humped turban. As the coast drew nearer, and the
   hideous stench of that city grew stronger, he saw upon the jagged hills
   many forests, some of whose trees he recognized as akin to that solitary
   moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth, from whose sap the small brown
   Zoogs ferment their curious wine.

   Carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead,
   and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them. For
   they were not men at all, or even approximately men, but great
   greyish-white slippery things which could expand and contract at will, and
   whose principal shape - though it often changed - was that of a sort of
   toad without any eyes, but with a curious vibrating mass of short pink
   tentacles on the end of its blunt, vague snout. These objects were
   waddling busily about the wharves, moving bales and crates and boxes with
   preternatural strength, and now and then hopping on or off some anchored
   galley with long oars in their forepaws. And now and then one would appear
   driving a herd of clumping slaves, which indeed were approximate human
   beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in Dylath-Leen;
   only these herds, being without turbans or shoes or clothing, did not seem
   so very human after all. Some of the slaves - the fatter ones, whom a sort
   of overseer would pinch experimentally - were unloaded from ships and
   nailed in crates which workers pushed into the low warehouses or loaded on
   great lumbering vans.

   Once a van was hitched and driven off, and the, fabulous thing which drew
   it was such that Carter gasped, even after having seen the other
   monstrosities of that hateful place. Now and then a small herd of slaves
   dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a
   galley, followed by a great crew of the slippery toad-things as officers,
   navigators, and rowers. And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures
   were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required
   no strength, such as steering and cooking, fetching and carrying, and
   bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded. These
   creatures must have been convenient on earth, for they were truly not
   unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned, and could haggle
   in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious explanations. But
   most of them, unless lean or ill-favoured, were unclothed and packed in
   crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things. Occasionally
   other beings were unloaded and crated; some very like these semi-humans,
   some not so similar, and some not similar at all. And he wondered if any
   of the poor stout black men of Parg were left to be unloaded and crated
   and shipped inland in those obnoxious drays.

   When the galley landed at a greasy-looking quay of spongy rock a nightmare
   horde of toad-things wiggled out of the hatches, and two of them seized
   Carter and dragged him ashore. The smell and aspect of that city are
   beyond telling, and Carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets
   and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without
   windows. At length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb
   infinite steps in pitch blackness. It was, apparently, all one to the
   toad-things whether it were light or dark. The odour of the place was
   intolerable, and when Carter was locked into a chamber and left alone he
   scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and
   dimensions. It was circular, and about twenty feet across.

   From then on time ceased to exist. At intervals food was pushed in, but
   Carter would not touch it. What his fate would be, he did not know; but he
   felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger
   of infinity's Other Gods, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Finally, after
   an unguessed span of hours or days, the great stone door swung wide again,
   and Carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the red-litten streets
   of that fearsome city. It was night on the moon, and all through the town
   were stationed slaves bearing torches.

   In a detestable square a sort of procession was formed; ten of the
   toad-things and twenty-four almost human torch-bearers, eleven on either
   side, and one each before and behind. Carter was placed in the middle of
   the line; five toad-things ahead and five behind, and one almost-human
   torch-bearer on either side of him. Certain of the toad-things produced
   disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made loathsome sounds. To that
   hellish piping the column advanced out of the tiled streets and into
   nighted plains of obscene fungi, soon commencing to climb one of the lower
   and more gradual hills that lay behind the city. That on some frightful
   slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited, Carter could not
   doubt; and he wished that the suspense might soon be over. The whining of
   those impious flutes was shocking, and he would have given worlds for some
   even half-normal sound; but these toad-things had no voices, and the
   slaves did not talk.

   Then through that star-specked darkness there did come a normal sound. It
   rolled from the higher hills, and from all the jagged peaks around it was
   caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus. It was the
   midnight yell of the cat, and Carter knew at last that the old village
   folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical realms
   which are known only to cats, and to which the elders among cats repair by
   stealth nocturnally, springing from high housetops. Verily, it is to the
   moon's dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and converse
   with ancient shadows, and here amidst that column of foetid things Carter
   heard their homely, friendly cry, and thought of the steep roofs and warm
   hearths and little lighted windows of home.

   Now much of the speech of cats was known to Randolph Carter, and in this
   far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable. But that he need
   not have done, for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and
   draw nearer, and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful
   shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions. The call of the clan
   had been given, and before the foul procession had time even to be
   frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were
   tidally and tempestuously upon it. The flutes stopped, and there were
   shrieks in the night. Dying almost-humans screamed, and cats spit and
   yowled and roared, but the toad-things made never a sound as their
   stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene
   fungi.

   It was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted, and Carter had never
   before seen so many cats. Black, grey, and white; yellow, tiger, and
   mixed; common, Persian, and Marix; Thibetan, Angora, and Egyptian; all
   were there in the fury of battle, and there hovered over them some trace
   of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in
   the temples of Bubastis. They would leap seven strong at the throat of an
   almost-human or the pink tentacled snout of a toad-thing and drag it down
   savagely to the fungous plain, where myriads of their fellows would surge
   over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine
   battle-fury. Carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave, but was soon
   overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders. Then he lay in the
   utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors,
   and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over
   him in the fray.

   At last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes, and when he opened them again
   it was upon a strange scene. The great shining disc of the earth, thirteen
   times greater than that of the moon as we see it, had risen with floods of
   weird light over the lunar landscape; and across all those leagues of wild
   plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly
   array. Circle on circle they reached, and two or three leaders out of the
   ranks were licking his face and purring to him consolingly. Of the dead
   slaves and toad-things there were not many signs, but Carter thought he
   saw one bone a little way off in the open space between him and the
   warriors.

   Carter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats, and
   learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and
   often spoken of in the places where cats congregate. He had not been
   unmarked in Ulthar when he passed through, and the sleek old cats had
   remembered how he patted them after they had attended to the hungry Zoogs
   who looked evilly at a small black kitten. And they recalled, too, how he
   had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at the inn, and
   how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning before he left.
   The grandfather of that very little kitten was the leader of the army now
   assembled, for he had seen the evil procession from a far hill and
   recognized the prisoner as a sworn friend of his kind on earth and in the
   land of dream.

   A yowl now came from the farther peak, and the old leader paused abruptly
   in his conversation. It was one of the army's outposts, stationed on the
   highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which Earth's cats fear; the
   very large and peculiar cats from Saturn, who for some reason have not
   been oblivious of the charm of our moon's dark side. They are leagued by
   treaty with the evil toad-things, and are notoriously hostile to our
   earthly cats; so that at this juncture a meeting would have been a
   somewhat grave matter.

   After a brief consultation of generals, the cats rose and assumed a closer
   formation, crowding protectingly around Carter and preparing to take the
   great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its
   dreamland. The old field-marshal advised Carter to let himself be borne
   along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers, and
   told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the
   rest landed. He also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired, and
   Carter decided on the city of Dylath-Leen whence the black galley had set
   out; for he wished to sail thence for Oriab and the carven crest Ngranek,
   and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with
   black galleys, if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously
   broken off. Then, upon a signal, the cats all leaped gracefully with their
   friend packed securely in their midst; while in a black cave on an
   unhallowed summit of the moon-mountains still vainly waited the crawling
   chaos Nyarlathotep.

   The leap of the cats through space was very swift; and being surrounded by
   his companions Carter did not see this time the great black
   shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss. Before he
   fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the
   inn at Dylath-Leen, and the stealthy, friendly cats were pouring out of
   the window in streams. The old leader from Ulthar was the last to leave,
   and as Carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by
   cockcrow. When dawn came, Carter went downstairs and learned that a week
   had elapsed since his capture and leaving. There was still nearly a
   fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward Oriab, and during that time he
   said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways. Most
   of the townsfolk believed him; yet so fond were the jewellers of great
   rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the
   wide-mouthed merchants. If aught of evil ever befalls Dylath-Leen through
   such traffick, it will not be his fault.

   In about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black wale and tall
   lighthouse, and Carter was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome
   men, with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey captain in
   silken robes. Her cargo was the fragrant resin of Oriab's inner groves,
   and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of Bahama, and the strange
   little figures carved from Ngranek's ancient lava. For this they were paid
   in the wool of Ulthar and the iridescent textiles of Hatheg and the ivory
   that the black men carve across the river in Parg. Carter made
   arrangements with the captain to go to Baharna and was told that the
   voyage would take ten days. And during his week of waiting he talked much
   with that captain of Ngranek, and was told that very few had seen the
   carven face thereon; but that most travellers are content to learn its
   legends from old people and lava-gatherers and image-makers in Baharna and
   afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it. The
   captain was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that
   carven face, for the wrong side of Ngranek is very difficult and barren
   and sinister, and there are rumours of caves near the peak wherein dwell
   the night-gaunts. But the captain did not wish to say just what a
   night-gaunt might be like, since such cattle are known to haunt most
   persistently the dreams of those who think too often of them. Then Carter
   asked that captain about unknown Kadath in the cold waste, and the
   marvellous sunset city, but of these the good man could truly tell
   nothing.

   Carter sailed out of Dylath-Leen one early morning when the tide turned,
   and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that
   dismal basalt town. And for two days they sailed eastward in sight of
   green coasts, and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up
   steeply with their red roofs and chimney-pots from old dreaming wharves
   and beaches where nets lay drying. But on the third day they turned
   sharply south where the roll of water was stronger, and soon passed from
   sight of any land. On the fifth day the sailors were nervous, but the
   captain apologized for their fears, saying that the ship was about to pass
   over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old for
   memory, and that when the water was clear one could see so many moving
   shadows in that deep place that simple folk disliked it. He admitted,
   moreover, that many ships had been lost in that part of the sea; having
   been hailed when quite close to it, but never seen again.

   That night the moon was very bright, and one could see a great way down in
   the water. There was so little wind that the ship could not move much, and
   the ocean was very calm. Looking over the rail Carter saw many fathoms
   deep the dome of the great temple, and in front of it an avenue of
   unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square. Dolphins
   sported merrily in and out of the ruins, and porpoises revelled clumsily
   here and there, sometimes coming to the surface and leaping clear out of
   the sea. As the ship drifted on a little the floor of the ocean rose in
   hills, and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing streets
   and the washed-down walls of myriad little houses.

   Then the suburbs appeared, and finally a great lone building on a hill, of
   simpler architecture than the other structures, and in much better repair.
   It was dark and low and covered four sides of a square, with a tower at
   each corner, a paved court in the centre, and small curious round windows
   all over it. Probably it was of basalt, though weeds draped the greater
   part; and such was its lonely and impressive place on that far hill that
   it may have been a temple or a monastery. Some phosphorescent fish inside
   it gave the small round windows an aspect of shining, and Carter did not
   blame the sailors much for their fears. Then by the watery moonlight he
   noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of that central court, and saw
   that something was tied to it. And when after getting a telescope from the
   captain's cabin he saw that that bound thing was a sailor in the silk
   robes of Oriab, head downward and without any eyes, he was glad that a
   rising breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the sea.

   The next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for Zar, in
   the land of forgotten dreams, with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for
   cargo. And on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the
   isle of Oriab with Ngranek rising jagged and snow-crowned in the distance.
   Oriab is a very great isle, and its port of Bahama a mighty city. The
   wharves of Bahama are of porphyry, and the city rises in great stone
   terraces behind them, having streets of steps that are frequently arched
   over by buildings and the bridges between buildings. There is a great
   canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with granite gates and
   leads to the inland lake of Yath, on whose farther shore are the vast
   clay-brick ruins of a primal city whose name is not remembered. As the
   ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin beacons Thon and Thal
   gleamed a welcome, and in all the million windows of Bahama's terraces
   mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as the stars peep out
   overhead in the dusk, till that steep and climbing seaport became a
   glittering constellation hung between the stars of heaven and the
   reflections of those stars in the still harbour.

   The captain, after landing, made Carter a guest in his own small house on
   the shores of Yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it; and his
   wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the traveller's
   delight. And in the days after that Carter asked for rumours and legends
   of Ngranek in all the taverns and public places where lava-gatherers and
   image-makers meet, but could find no one who had been up the higher slopes
   or seen the carven face. Ngranek was a hard mountain with only an accursed
   valley behind it, and besides, one could never depend on the certainty
   that night-gaunts are altogether fabulous.

   When the captain sailed hack to Dylath-Leen Carter took quarters in an
   ancient tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the
   town, which is built of brick and resembles the ruins of Yath's farther
   shore. Here he laid his plans for the ascent of Ngranek, and correlated
   all that he had learned from the lava-gatherers about the roads thither.
   The keeper of the tavern was a very old man, and had heard so many legends
   that he was a great help. He even took Carter to an upper room in that
   ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a traveller had
   scratched on the clay wall in the old days when men were bolder and less
   reluctant to visit Ngranek's higher slopes. The old tavern-keeper's
   great-grandfather had heard from his great-grandfather that the traveller
   who scratched that picture had climbed Ngranek and seen the carven face,
   here drawing it for others to behold, but Carter had very great doubts,
   since the large rough features on the wall were hasty and careless, and
   wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little companion shapes in the worst
   possible taste, with horns and wings and claws and curling tails.

   At last, having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the
   taverns and public places of Baharna, Carter hired a zebra and set out one
   morning on the road by Yath's shore for those inland parts wherein towers
   stony Ngranek. On his right were rolling hills and pleasant orchards and
   neat little stone farmhouses, and he was much reminded of those fertile
   fields that flank the Skai. By evening he was near the nameless ancient
   ruins on Yath's farther shore, and though old lava-gatherers had warned
   him not to camp there at night, he tethered his zebra to a curious pillar
   before a crumbling wall and laid his blanket in a sheltered corner beneath
   some carvings whose meaning none could decipher. Around him he wrapped
   another blanket, for the nights are cold in Oriab; and when upon awaking
   once he thought he felt the wings of some insect brushing his face he
   covered his head altogether and slept in peace till roused by the magah
   birds in distant resin groves.

   The sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal
   brick foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and
   pedestals stretched down desolate to the shore of Yath, and Carter looked
   about for his tethered zebra. Great was his dismay to see that docile
   beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it had been
   tied, and still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed was quite
   dead, with its blood all sucked away through a singular wound in its
   throat. His pack had been disturbed, and several shiny knickknacks taken
   away, and all round on the dusty soil' were great webbed footprints for
   which he could not in any way account. The legends and warnings of
   lava-gatherers occurred to him, and he thought of what had brushed his
   face in the night. Then he shouldered his pack and strode on toward
   Ngranek, though not without a shiver when he saw close to him as the
   highway passed through the ruins a great gaping arch low in the wall of an
   old temple, with steps leading down into darkness farther than he could
   peer.

   His course now lay uphill through wilder and partly wooded country, and he
   saw only the huts of charcoal-burners and the camp of those who gathered
   resin from the groves. The whole air was fragrant with balsam, and all the
   magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven colours in the sun.
   Near sunset he came on a new camp of lava-gatherers returning with laden
   sacks from Ngranek's lower slopes; and here he also camped, listening to
   the songs and tales of the men, and overhearing what they whispered about
   a companion they had lost. He had climbed high to reach a mass of fine
   lava above him, and at nightfall did not return to his fellows. When they
   looked for him the next day they found only his turban, nor was there any
   sign on the crags below that he had fallen. They did not search any more,
   because the old man among them said it would be of no use.

   No one ever found what the night-gaunts took, though those beasts
   themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous. Carter asked them
   if night-gaunts sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed
   footprints, but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed
   frightened at his making such an inquiry. When he saw how taciturn they
   had become he asked them no more, but went to sleep in his blanket.

   The next day he rose with the lava-gatherers and exchanged farewells as
   they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he bought of them. Their older
   men gave him blessings and warnings, and told him he had better not climb
   too high on Ngranek, but while he thanked them heartily he was in no wise
   dissuaded. For still did he feel that he must find the gods on unknown
   Kadath; and win from them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in
   the sunset. By noon, after a long uphill ride, he came upon some abandoned
   brick villages of the hill-people who had once dwelt thus close to Ngranek
   and carved images from its smooth lava. Here they had dwelt till the days
   of the old tavernkeeper's grandfather, but about that time they felt that
   their presence was disliked. Their homes had crept even up the mountain's
   slope, and the higher they built the more people they would miss when the
   sun rose. At last they decided it would be better to leave altogether,
   since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could
   interpret favourably; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and
   dwelt in Bahama, inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the
   old art of image-making which to this day they carry on. It was from these
   children of the exiled hill-people that Carter had heard the best tales
   about Ngranek when searching through Bahama's ancient taverns.

   All this time the great gaunt side of Ngranek was looming up higher and
   higher as Carter approached it. There were sparse trees on the lower
   slopes and feeble shrubs above them, and then the bare hideous rock rose
   spectral into the sky, to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow. Carter
   could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone, and did not
   welcome the prospect of climbing it. In places there were solid streams of
   lava, and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges. Ninety aeons ago,
   before even the gods had danced upon its pointed peak, that mountain had
   spoken with fire and roared with the voices of the inner thunders. Now it
   towered all silent and sinister, bearing on the hidden side that secret
   titan image whereof rumour told. And there were caves in that mountain,
   which might be empty and alone with elder darkness, or might - if legend
   spoke truly - hold horrors of a form not to be surmised.

   The ground sloped upward to the foot of Ngranek, thinly covered with scrub
   oaks and ash trees, and strewn with bits of rock, lava, and ancient
   cinder. There were the charred embers of many camps, where the
   lava-gatherers were wont to stop, and several rude altars which they had
   built either to propitiate the Great Ones or to ward off what they dreamed
   of in Ngranek's high passes and labyrinthine caves. At evening Carter
   reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night, tethering
   his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his blankets before
   going to sleep. And all through the night a voonith howled distantly from
   the shore of some hidden pool, but Carter felt no fear of that amphibious
   terror, since he had been told with certainty that not one of them dares
   even approach the slope of Ngranek.

   In the clear sunshine of morning Carter began the long ascent, taking his
   zebra as far as that useful beast could go, but tying it to a stunted ash
   tree when the floor of the thin wood became too steep. Thereafter he
   scrambled up alone; first through the forest with its ruins of old
   villages in overgrown clearings, and then over the tough grass where
   anaemic shrubs grew here and there. He regretted coming clear of the
   trees, since the slope was very precipitous and the whole thing rather
   dizzying. At length he began to discern all the countryside spread out
   beneath him whenever he looked about; the deserted huts of the
   image-makers, the groves of resin trees and the camps of those who
   gathered from them, the woods where prismatic magahs nest and sing, and
   even a hint very far away of the shores of Yath and of those forbidding
   ancient ruins whose name is forgotten. He found it best not to look
   around, and kept on climbing and climbing till the shrubs became very
   sparse and there was often nothing but the tough grass to cling to.

   Then the soil became meagre, with great patches of bare rock cropping out,
   and now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice. Finally there was
   nothing at all but the bare rock, and had it not been very rough and
   weathered, he could scarcely have ascended farther. Knobs, ledges, and
   pinnacles, however, helped greatly; and it was cheering to see
   occasionally the sign of some lava-gatherer scratched clumsily in the
   friable stone, and know that wholesome human creatures had been there
   before him. After a certain height the presence of man was further shewn
   by handholds and footholds hewn where they were needed, and by little
   quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of lava had been
   found. In one place a narrow ledge had been chopped artificially to an
   especially rich deposit far to the right of the main line of ascent. Once
   or twice Carter dared to look around, and was almost stunned by the spread
   of landscape below. All the island betwixt him and the coast lay open to
   his sight, with Baharna's stone terraces and the smoke of its chimneys
   mystical in the distance. And beyond that the illimitable Southern Sea
   with all its curious secrets.

   Thus far there had been much winding around the mountain, so that the
   farther and carven side was still hidden. Carter now saw a ledge running
   upward and to the left which seemed to head the way he wished, and this
   course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous. After ten
   minutes he saw it was indeed no cul-de-sac, but that it led steeply on in
   an arc which would, unless suddenly interrupted or deflected, bring him
   after a few hours' climbing to that unknown southern slope overlooking the
   desolate crags and the accursed valley of lava. As new country came into
   view below him he saw that it was bleaker and wilder than those seaward
   lands he had traversed. The mountain's side, too, was somewhat different;
   being here pierced by curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter
   route he had left. Some of these were above him and some beneath him, all
   opening on sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the feet
   of man. The air was very cold now, but so hard was the climbing that he
   did not mind it. Only the increasing rarity bothered him, and he thought
   that perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers
   and excited those absurd tales of night-gaunts whereby they explained the
   loss of such climbers as fell from these perilous paths. He was not much
   impressed by travellers' tales, but had a good curved scimitar in case of
   any trouble. All lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see that carven
   face which might set him on the track of the gods atop unknown Kadath.

   At last, in the fearsome iciness of upper space, he came round fully to
   the hidden side of Ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the lesser
   crags and sterile abysses of lava which marked olden wrath of the Great
   Ones. There was unfolded, too, a vast expanse of country to the south; but
   it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage chimneys, and seemed
   to have no ending. No trace of the sea was visible on this side, for Oriab
   is a great island. Black caverns and odd crevices were still numerous on
   the sheer vertical cliffs, but none of them was accessible to a climber.
   There now loomed aloft a great beetling mass which hampered the upward
   view, and Carter was for a moment shaken with doubt lest it prove
   impassable. Poised in windy insecurity miles above earth, with only space
   and death on one side and only slippery walls of rock on the other, he
   knew for a moment the fear that makes men shun Ngranek's hidden side. He
   could not turn round, yet the sun was already low. If there were no way
   aloft, the night would find him crouching there still, and the dawn would
   not find him at all.

   But there was a way, and he saw it in due season. Only a very expert
   dreamer could have used those imperceptible footholds, yet to Carter they
   were sufficient. Surmounting now the outward-hanging rock, he found the
   slope above much easier than that below, since a great glacier's melting
   had left a generous space with loam and ledges. To the left a precipice
   dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown depths, with a cave's
   dark mouth just out of reach above him. Elsewhere, however, the mountain
   slanted back strongly, and even gave him space to lean and rest.

   He felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line, and looked up
   to see what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy
   sunlight. Surely enough, there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet
   above, and below it a great beetling crag like that. he had just climbed;
   hanging there forever in bold outline. And when he saw that crag he gasped
   and cried out aloud, and clutched at the jagged rock in awe; for the titan
   bulge had not stayed as earth's dawn had shaped it, but gleamed red and
   stupendous in the sunset with the carved and polished features of a god.

   Stern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire. How vast
   it was no mind can ever measure, but Carter knew at once that man could
   never have fashioned it. It was a god chiselled by the hands of the gods,
   and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker. Rumour had said
   it was strange and not to be mistaken, and Carter saw that it was indeed
   so; for those long narrow eyes and long-lobed ears, and that thin nose and
   pointed chin, all spoke of a race that is not of men but of gods.

   He clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie, even though it was
   this which he had expected and come to find; for there is in a god's face
   more of marvel than prediction can tell, and when that face is vaster than
   a great temple and seen looking downward at sunset in the scyptic silences
   of that upper world from whose dark lava it was divinely hewn of old, the
   marvel is so strong that none may escape it.

   Here, too, was the added marvel of recognition; for although he had
   planned to search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this face
   might mark them as the god's children, he now knew that he need not do so.
   Certainly, the great face carven on that mountain was of no strange sort,
   but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns of the seaport
   Celephais which lies in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills and is ruled
   over by that King Kuranes whom Carter once knew in waking life. Every year
   sailors with such a face came in dark ships from the north to trade their
   onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of
   Celephais, and it was clear that these could be no others than the
   hall-gods he sought. Where they dwelt, there must the cold waste lie
   close, and within it unknown Kadath and its onyx castle for the Great
   Ones. So to Celephais he must go, far distant from the isle of Oriab, and
   in such parts as would take him back to Dylath-Teen and up the Skai to the
   bridge by Nir, and again into the enchanted wood of the Zoogs, whence the
   way would bend northward through the garden lands by Oukranos to the
   gilded spires of Thran, where he might find a galleon bound over the
   Cerenarian Sea.

   But dusk was now thick, and the great carven face looked down even sterner
   in shadow. Perched on that ledge night found the seeker; and in the
   blackness he might neither go down nor go up, but only stand and cling and
   shiver in that narrow place till the day came, praying to keep awake lest
   sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles of air to the crags
   and sharp rocks of the accursed valley. The stars came out, but save for
   them there was only black nothingness in his eyes; nothingness leagued
   with death, against whose beckoning he might do no more than cling to the
   rocks and lean back away from an unseen brink. The last thing of earth
   that he saw in the gloaming was a condor soaring close to the westward
   precipice beside him, and darting screaming away when it came near the
   cave whose mouth yawned just out of reach.

   Suddenly, without a warning sound in the dark, Carter felt his curved
   scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand. Then he
   heard it clatter down over the rocks below. And between him and the Milky
   Way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin
   and horned and tailed and bat-winged. Other things, too, had begun to blot
   out patches of stars west of him, as if a flock of vague entities were
   flapping thickly and silently out of that inaccessible cave in the face of
   the precipice. Then a sort of cold rubbery arm seized his neck and
   something else seized his feet, and he was lifted inconsiderately up and
   swung about in space. Another minute and the stars were gone, and Carter
   knew that the night-gaunts had got him.

   They bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous
   labyrinths beyond. When he struggled, as at first he did by instinct, they
   tickled him with deliberation. They made no sound at all themselves, and
   even their membranous wings were silent. They were frightfully cold and
   damp and slippery, and their paws kneaded one detestably. Soon they were
   plunging hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling,
   giddying, sickening rush of dank, tomb-like air; and Carter felt they were
   shooting into the ultimate vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness. He
   screamed again and again, but whenever he did so the black paws tickled
   him with greater subtlety. Then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence
   about, and guessed they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene
   horror of which dim legends tell, and which is litten only by the pale
   death-fire wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the
   pits at earth's core.

   At last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles
   which he knew must be the fabled Peaks of Throk. Awful and sinister they
   stand in the haunted disc of sunless and eternal depths; higher than man
   may reckon, and guarding terrible valleys where the Dholes crawl and
   burrow nastily. But Carter preferred to look at them than at his captors,
   which were indeed shocking and uncouth black things with smooth, oily,
   whale-like surfaces, unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each
   other, bat wings whose beating made no sound, ugly prehensile paws, and
   barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly. And worst of all,
   they never spoke or laughed, and never smiled because they had no faces at
   all to smile with, but only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to
   be. All they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle; that was the way of
   night-gaunts.

   As the band flew lower the Peaks of Throk rose grey and towering on all
   sides, and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and
   impressive granite of the endless twilight. At still lower levels the
   death-fires in the air gave out, and one met only the primal blackness of
   the void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out goblin-like. Soon the
   peaks were very far away, and nothing about but great rushing winds with
   the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them. Then in the end the
   night-gaunts landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers of
   bones, and left Carter all alone in that black valley. To bring him
   thither was the duty of the night-gaunts that guard Ngranek; and this
   done, they flapped away silently. When Carter tried to trace their flight
   he found he could not, since even the Peaks of Throk had faded out of
   sight. There was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and silence and
   bones.

   Now Carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of Pnoth,
   where crawl and burrow the enormous Dholes; but he did not know what to
   expect, because no one has ever seen a Dhole or even guessed what such a
   thing may be like. Dholes are known only by dim rumour, from the rustling
   they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they have when
   they wriggle past one. They cannot be seen because they creep only in the
   dark. Carter did not wish to meet a Dhole, so listened intently for any
   sound in the unknown depths of bones about him. Even in this fearsome
   place he had a plan and an objective, for whispers of Pnoth were not
   unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the old days. In brief, it
   seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into which all the ghouls of
   the waking world cast the refuse of their feastings; and that if he but
   had good luck he might stumble upon that mighty crag taller even than
   Throk's peaks which marks the edge of their domain. Showers of bones would
   tell him where to look, and once found he could call to a ghoul to let
   down a ladder; for strange to say, he had a very singular link with these
   terrible creatures.

   A man he had known in Boston - a painter of strange pictures with a secret
   studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyard - had actually
   made friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand the simpler
   part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering. This man had vanished at
   last, and Carter was not sure but that he might find him now, and use for
   the first time in dreamland that far-away English of his dim waking life.
   In any case, he felt he could persuade a ghoul to guide him out of Pnoth;
   and it would be better to meet a ghoul, which one can see, than a Dhole,
   which one cannot see.

   So Carter walked in the dark, and ran when he thought he heard something
   among the bones underfoot. Once he bumped into a stony slope, and knew it
   must be the base of one of Throk's peaks. Then at last he heard a
   monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air, and became
   sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls. He was not sure he could be
   heard from this valley miles below, but realised that the inner world has
   strange laws. As he pondered he was struck by a flying bone so heavy that
   it must have been a skull, and therefore realising his nearness to the
   fateful crag he sent up as best he might that meeping cry which is the
   call of the ghoul.

   Sound travels slowly, so it was some time before he heard an answering
   glibber. But it came at last, and before long he was told that a rope
   ladder would be lowered. The wait for this was very tense, since there was
   no telling what might not have been stirred up among those bones by his
   shouting. Indeed, it was not long before he actually did hear a vague
   rustling afar off. As this thoughtfully approached, he became more and
   more uncomfortable; for he did not wish to move away from the spot where
   the ladder would come. Finally the tension grew almost unbearable, and he
   was about to flee in panic when the thud of something on the newly heaped
   bones nearby drew his notice from the other sound. It was the ladder, and
   after a minute of groping he had it taut in his hands. But the other sound
   did not cease, and followed him even as he climbed. He had gone fully five
   feet from the ground when the rattling beneath waxed emphatic, and was a
   good ten feet up when something swayed the ladder from below. At a height
   which must have been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole side brushed
   by a great slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave with
   wriggling; and hereafter he climbed desperately to escape the unendurable
   nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed Dhole whose form no man might see.

   For hours he climbed with aching and blistered hands, seeing again the
   grey death-fire and Throk's uncomfortable pinnacles. At last he discerned
   above him the projecting edge of the great crag of the ghouls, whose
   vertical side he could not glimpse; and hours later he saw a curious face
   peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet of Notre Dame. This
   almost made him lose his hold through faintness, but a moment later he was
   himself again; for his vanished friend Richard Pickman had once introduced
   him to a ghoul, and he knew well their canine faces and slumping forms and
   unmentionable idiosyncrasies. So he had himself well under control when
   that hideous thing pulled him out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of
   the crag, and did not scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one
   side or at the squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched
   curiously.

   He was now on a dim-litten plain whose sole topographical features were
   great boulders and the entrances of burrows. The ghouls were in general
   respectful, even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others eyed
   his leanness speculatively. Through patient glibbering he made inquiries
   regarding his vanished friend, and found he had become a ghoul of some
   prominence in abysses nearer the waking world. A greenish elderly ghoul
   offered to conduct him to Pickman's present habitation, so despite a
   natural loathing he followed the creature into a capacious burrow and
   crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould. They emerged
   on a dim plain strewn with singular relics of earth - old gravestones,
   broken urns, and grotesque fragments of monuments - and Carter realised
   with some emotion that he was probably nearer the waking world than at any
   other time since he had gone down the seven hundred steps from the cavern
   of flame to the Gate of Deeper Slumber.

   There, on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the Granary Burying Ground in
   Boston, sat a ghoul which was once the artist Richard Upton Pickman. It
   was naked and rubbery, and had acquired so much of the ghoulish
   physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure. But it still
   remembered a little English, and was able to converse with Carter in
   grunts and monosyllables, helped out now and then by the glibbering of
   ghouls. When it learned that Carter wished to get to the enchanted wood
   and from there to the city Celephais in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian
   Hills, it seemed rather doubtful; for these ghouls of the waking world do
   no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland (leaving that to the
   red-footed wamps that are spawned in dead cities), and many things
   intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood, including the
   terrible kingdom of the Gugs.

   The Gugs, hairy and gigantic, once reared stone circles in that wood and
   made strange sacrifices to the Other Gods and the crawling chaos
   Nyarlathotep, until one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears of
   earth's gods and they were banished to caverns below. Only a great trap
   door of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the earth-ghouls
   with the enchanted wood, and this the Gugs are afraid to open because of a
   curse. That a mortal dreamer could traverse their cavern realm and leave
   by that door is inconceivable; for mortal dreamers were their former food,
   and they have legends of the toothsomeness of such dreamers even though
   banishment has restricted their diet to the ghasts, those repulsive beings
   which die in the light, and which live in the vaults of Zin and leap on
   long hind legs like kangaroos.

   So the ghoul that was Pickman advised Carter either to leave the abyss at
   Sarkomand, that deserted city in the valley below Leng where black nitrous
   stairways guarded by winged diarote lions lead down from dreamland to the
   lower gulfs, or to return through a churchyard to the waking world and
   begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light slumber to the cavern
   of flame and the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber and the
   enchanted wood. This, however, did not suit the seeker; for he knew
   nothing of the way from Leng to Ooth-Nargai, and was likewise reluctant to
   awake lest he forget all he had so far gained in this dream. It was
   disastrous to his quest to forget the august and celestial faces of those
   seamen from the north who traded onyx in Celephais, and who, being the
   sons of gods, must point the way to the cold waste and Kadath where the
   Great Ones dwell.

   After much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the
   great wall of the Gugs' kingdom. There was one chance that Carter might be
   able to steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers at an
   hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors, and reach
   the central tower with the sign of Koth upon it, which has the stairs
   leading up to that stone trap door in the enchanted wood. Pickman even
   consented to lend three ghouls to help with a tombstone lever in raising
   the stone door; for of ghouls the Gugs are somewhat afraid, and they often
   flee from their own colossal graveyards when they see them feasting there.

   He also advised Carter to disguise as a ghoul himself; shaving the beard
   he had allowed to grow (for ghouls have none), wallowing naked in the
   mould to get the correct surface, and loping in the usual slumping way,
   with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice morsel from a
   tomb. They would reach the city of Gugs - which is coterminous with the
   whole kingdom - through the proper burrows, emerging in a cemetery not far
   from the stair-containing Tower of Koth. They must beware, however, of a
   large cave near the cemetery; for this is the mouth of the vaults of Zin,
   and the vindictive ghasts are always on watch there murderously for those
   denizens of the upper abyss who hunt and prey on them. The ghasts try to
   come out when the Gugs sleep and they attack ghouls as readily as Gugs,
   for they cannot discriminate. They are very primitive, and eat one
   another. The Gugs have a sentry at a narrow in the vaults of Zin, but he
   is often drowsy and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts. Though
   ghasts cannot live in real light, they can endure the grey twilight of the
   abyss for hours.

   So at length Carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful
   ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of Col. Nepemiah Derby, obit 1719,
   from the Charter Street Burying Ground in Salem. When they came again into
   open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching
   nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest gravestones of
   the Gugs. On the right of the hole out of which they wriggled, and seen
   through aisles of monoliths, was a stupendous vista of cyclopean round
   towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of inner earth. This was
   the great city of the Gugs, whose doorways are thirty feet high. Ghouls
   come here often, for a buried Gug will feed a community for almost a year,
   and even with the added peril it is better to burrow for Gugs than to
   bother with the graves of men. Carter now understood the occasional titan
   bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of Pnoth.

   Straight ahead, and just outside the cemetery, rose a sheer perpendicular
   cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern yawned. This the
   ghouls told Carter to avoid as much as possible, since it was the entrance
   to the unhallowed vaults of Zin where Gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness.
   And truly, that warning was soon well justified; for the moment a ghoul
   began to creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the Gugs' resting
   had been rightly timed, there glowed in the gloom of that great cavern's
   mouth first one pair of yellowish-red eyes and then another, implying that
   the Gugs were one sentry less, and that ghasts have indeed an excellent
   sharpness of smell. So the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his
   companions to be silent. It was best to leave the ghasts to their own
   devices, and there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw, since
   they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a Gug sentry in the
   black vaults. After a moment something about the size of a small horse
   hopped out into the grey twilight, and Carter turned sick at the aspect of
   that scabrous and unwholesome beast, whose face is so curiously human
   despite the absence of a nose, a forehead, and other important
   particulars.

   Presently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow, and a ghoul
   glibbered softly at Carter that their absence of battle-scars was a bad
   sign. It proved that theY had not fought the Gug sentry at all, but had
   merely slipped past him as he slept, so that their strength and savagery
   were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found and disposed
   of a victim. It was very unpleasant to see those filthy and
   disproportioned animals which soon numbered about fifteen, grubbing about
   and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan towers
   and monoliths arose, but it was still more unpleasant when they spoke
   among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts. And yet, horrible as
   they were, they were not so horrible as what presently came out of the
   cave after them with disconcerting suddenness.

   It was a paw, fully two feet and a half across, and equipped with
   formidable talons. Alter it came another paw, and after that a great
   black-furred arm to which both of the paws were attached by short
   forearms. Then two pink eyes shone, and the head of the awakened Gug
   sentry, large as a barrel, wabbled into view. The eyes jutted two inches
   from each side, shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs.
   But the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth. That mouth had
   great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of the head, opening
   vertically instead of horizontally.

   But before that unfortunate Gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his
   full twenty feet, the vindictive ghasts were upon him. Carter feared for a
   moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin, till a ghoul
   softly glibbered that Gugs have no voice but talk by means of facial
   expression. The battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one. From
   all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at the creeping Gug,
   nipping and tearing with their muzzles, and mauling murderously with their
   hard pointed hooves. All the time they coughed excitedly, screaming when
   the great vertical mouth of the Gug would occasionally bite into one of
   their number, so that the noise of the combat would surely have aroused
   the sleeping city had not the weakening of the sentry begun to transfer
   the action farther and farther within the cavern. As it was, the tumult
   soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness, with only occasional
   evil echoes to mark its continuance.

   Then the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance, and
   Carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into
   the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers of
   cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight. Silently they shambled over
   that rough rock pavement, hearing with disgust the abominable muffled
   snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of the Gugs.
   Apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour, the ghouls set a somewhat
   rapid pace; but even so the journey was no brief one, for distances in
   that town of giants are on a great scale. At last, however, they came to a
   somewhat open space before a tower even vaster than the rest; above whose
   colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous symbol in bas-relief which made one
   shudder without knowing its meaning. This was the central tower with the
   sign of Koth, and those huge stone steps just visible through the dusk
   within were the beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland
   and the enchanted wood.

   There now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness: made
   almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps, which were fashioned
   for Gugs, and were therefore nearly a yard high. Of their number Carter
   could form no just estimate, for he soon became so worn out that the
   tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him. All through the
   endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit; for though
   no Gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the Great One's
   curse, there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps,
   and escaped ghasts are often chased, even to the very top. So sharp are
   the ears of Gugs, that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might
   readily be heard when the city awoke; and it would of course take but
   little time for the striding giants, accustomed from their ghast-hunts in
   the vaults of Zin to seeing without light, to overtake their smaller and
   slower quarry on those cyclopean steps. It was very depressing to reflect
   that the silent pursuing Gugs would not be heard at all, but would come
   very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers. Nor could the
   traditional fear of Gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar
   place where the advantages lay so heavily with the Gugs. There was also
   some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts, which frequently hopped
   up onto the tower during the sleep hour of the Gugs. If the Gugs slept
   long, and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern, the
   scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and
   ill-disposed things; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten
   by a Gug.

   Then, after aeons of climbing, there came a cough from the darkness above;
   and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn.

   It was clear that a ghast, or perhaps even more, had strayed into that
   tower before the coming of Carter and his guides; and it was equally clear
   that this peril was very close. Alter a breathless second the leading
   ghoul pushed Carter to the wall and arranged his kinfolk in the best
   possible way, with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow
   whenever the enemy might come in sight. Ghouls can see in the dark, so the
   party was not as badly off as Carter would have been alone. In another
   moment the clatter of hooves revealed the downward hopping of at least one
   beast, and the slab-bearing ghouls poised their weapon for a desperate
   blow. Presently two yellowish-red eyes flashed into view, and the panting
   of the ghast became audible above its clattering. As it hopped down to the
   step above the ghouls, they wielded the ancient gravestone with prodigious
   force, so that there was only a wheeze and a choking before the victim
   collapsed in a noxious heap. There seemed to be only this one animal, and
   after a moment of listening the ghouls tapped Carter as a signal to
   proceed again. As before, they were obliged to aid him; and he was glad to
   leave that place of carnage where the ghast's uncouth remains sprawled
   invisible in the blackness.

   At last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt; and feeling above
   him, Carter realised that the great stone trap door was reached at last.
   To open so vast a thing completely was not to be thought of, but the
   ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under as a
   prop, and permit Carter to escape through the crack. They themselves
   planned to descend again and return through the city of the Gugs, since
   their elusiveness was great, and they did not know the way overland to
   spectral Sarkomand with its lion-guarded gate to the abyss.

   Mighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door
   above them, and Carter helped push with as much strength as he had. They
   judged the edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one, and to
   this they bent all the force of their disreputably nourished muscles.
   Alter a few moments a crack of light appeared; and Carter, to whom that
   task had been entrusted, slipped the end of the old gravestone in the
   aperture. There now ensued a mighty heaving; but progress was very slow,
   and they had of course to return to their first position every time they
   failed to turn the slab and prop the portal open.

   Suddenly their desperation was magnified a thousand fold by a sound on the
   steps below them. It was only the thumping and rattling of the slain
   ghast's hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels; but of all the
   possible causes of that body's dislodgement and rolling, none was in the
   least reassuring. Therefore, knowing the ways of Gugs, the ghouls set to
   with something of a frenzy; and in a surprisingly short time had the door
   so high that they were able to hold it still whilst Carter turned the slab
   and left a generous opening. They now helped Carter through, letting him
   climb up to their rubbery shoulders and later guiding his feet as he
   clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland outside. Another
   second and they were through themselves, knocking away the gravestone and
   closing the great trap door while a panting became audible beneath.
   Because of the Great One's curse no Gug might ever emerge from that
   portal, so with a deep relief and sense of repose Carter lay quietly on
   the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted
   near in the manner that ghouls rest.

   Weird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago,
   it was verily a haven and a delight after those gulfs he had now left
   behind. There was no living denizen about, for Zoogs shun the mysterious
   door in fear and Carter at once consulted with his ghouls about their
   future course. To return through the tower they no longer dared, and the
   waking world did not appeal to them when they learned that they must pass
   the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in the cavern of flame. So at length they
   decided to return through Sarkomand and its gate of the abyss, though of
   how to get there they knew nothing. Carter recalled that it lies in the
   valley below Leng, and recalled likewise that he had seen in Dylath-Leen a
   sinister, slant-eyed old merchant reputed to trade on Leng, therefore he
   advised the ghouls to seek out Dylath-Leen, crossing the fields to Nir and
   the Skai and following the river to its mouth. This they at once resolved
   to do, and lost no time in loping off, since the thickening of the dusk
   promised a full night ahead for travel. And Carter shook the paws of those
   repulsive beasts, thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude
   to the beast which once was Pickman; but could not help sighing with
   pleasure when they left. For a ghoul is a ghoul, and at best an unpleasant
   companion for man. After that Carter sought a forest pool and cleansed
   himself of the mud of nether earth, thereupon reassuming the clothes he
   had so carefully carried.

   It was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees, but because
   of the phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day; wherefore
   Carter set out upon the well-known route toward Celephais, in Ooth-Nargai
   beyond the Tanarian Hills. And as he went he thought of the zebra he had
   left tethered to an ash-tree on Ngranek in far-away Oriab so many aeons
   ago, and wondered if any lava-gatherers had fed and released it. And he
   wondered, too, if he would ever return to Baharna and pay for the zebra
   that was slain by night in those ancient ruins by Yath's shore, and if the
   old tavernkeeper would remember him. Such were the thoughts that came to
   him in the air of the regained upper dreamland.

   But presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow
   tree. He had avoided the great circle of stones, since he did not care to
   speak with Zoogs just now; but it appeared from the singular fluttering in
   that huge tree that important councils were in session elsewhere. Upon
   drawing nearer he made out the accents of a tense and heated discussion;
   and before long became conscious of matters which he viewed with the
   greatest concern. For a war on the cats was under debate in that sovereign
   assembly of Zoogs. It all came from the loss of the party which had
   sneaked after Carter to Ulthar, and which the cats had justly punished for
   unsuitable intentions. The matter had long rankled; and now, or at least
   within a month, the marshalled Zoogs were about to strike the whole feline
   tribe in a series of surprise attacks, taking individual cats or groups of
   cats unawares, and giving not even the myriad cats of Ulthar a proper
   chance to drill and mobilise. This was the plan of the Zoogs, and Carter
   saw that he must foil it before leaving upon his mighty quest.

   Very quietly therefore did Randolph Carter steal to the edge of the wood
   and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields. And a great grimalkin
   in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across leagues of
   rolling meadow to warriors large and small, black, grey, tiger, white,
   yellow, and mixed, and it echoed through Nir and beyond the Skai even into
   Ulthar, and Ulthar's numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line
   of march. It was fortunate that the moon was not up, so that all the cats
   were on earth. Swiftly and silently leaping, they sprang from every hearth
   and housetop and poured in a great furry sea across the plains to the edge
   of the wood. Carter was there to greet them, and the sight of shapely,
   wholesome cats was indeed good for his eyes after the things he had seen
   and walked with in the abyss. He was glad to see his venerable friend and
   one-time rescuer at the head of Ulthar's detachment, a collar of rank
   around his sleek neck, and whiskers bristling at a martial angle. Better
   still, as a sub-lieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who
   proved to be none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom
   Carter had given a saucer of rich cream on that long-vanished morning in
   Ulthar. He was a strapping and promising cat now, and purred as he shook
   hands with his friend. His grandfather said he was doing very well in the
   army, and that he might well expect a captaincy after one more campaign.

   Carter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe, and was rewarded by
   deep-throated purrs of gratitude from all sides. Consulting with the
   generals, he prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching at
   once upon the Zoog council and other known strongholds of Zoogs;
   forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before the
   mobilization of their army of invasion. Thereupon without a moment's loss
   that great ocean of cats flooded the enchanted wood and surged around the
   council tree and the great stone circle. Flutterings rose to panic pitch
   as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was very little resistance among
   the furtive and curious brown Zoogs. They saw that they were beaten in
   advance, and turned from thoughts of vengeance to thoughts of present
   self-preservation.

   Half the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the
   captured Zoogs in the centre, leaving open a lane down which were marched
   the additional captives rounded up by the other cats in other parts of the
   wood. Terms were discussed at length, Carter acting as interpreter, and it
   was decided that the Zoogs might remain a free tribe on condition of
   rendering to the cats a large tribute of grouse, quail, and pheasants from
   the less fabulous parts of the forest. Twelve young Zoogs of noble
   families were taken as hostages to be kept in the Temple of Cats at
   Ulthar, and the victors made it plain that any disappearances of cats on
   the borders of the Zoog domain would be followed by consequences highly
   disastrous to Zoogs. These matters disposed of, the assembled cats broke
   ranks and permitted the Zoogs to slink off one by one to their respective
   homes, which they hastened to do with many a sullen backward glance.

   The old cat general now offered Carter an escort through the forest to
   whatever border he wished to reach, deeming it likely that the Zoogs would
   harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike
   enterprise. This offer he welcomed with gratitude; not only for the safety
   it afforded, but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats. So
   in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment, relaxed after the
   successful performance of its duty, Randolph Carter walked with dignity
   through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees, talking of
   his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band
   indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove
   among the fungi of that primeval floor. And the old cat said that he had
   heard much of unknown Kadath in the cold waste, but did not know where it
   was. As for the marvellous sunset city, he had not even heard of that, but
   would gladly relay to Carter anything he might later learn.

   He gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of
   dreamland, and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in
   Celephais, whither he was bound. That old cat, already slightly known to
   Carter, was a dignified maltese; and would prove highly influential in any
   transaction. It was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood,
   and Carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell. The young sub-lieutenant
   he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old
   general forbidden it, but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of
   duty lay with the tribe and the army. So Carter set out alone over the
   golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willow-fringed river, and
   the cats went back into the wood.

   Well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood
   of the Cerenerian Sea, and blithely did he follow the singing river
   Oukianos that marked his course. The sun rose higher over gentle slopes of
   grove and lawn, and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that
   starred each knoll and dangle. A blessed haze lies upon all this region,
   wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold, and
   a little more of the summer's humming music of birds and bees; so that men
   walk through it as through a faery place, and feel greater joy and wonder
   than they ever afterward remember.

   By noon Carter reached the jasper terraces of Kiran which slope down to
   the river's edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the King of
   Ilek-Vad comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a
   golden palanqnin to pray to the god of Oukianos, who sang to him in youth
   when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks. All of jasper is that temple, and
   covering an acre of ground with its walls and courts, its seven pinnacled
   towers, and its inner shrine where the river enters through hidden
   channels and the god sings softly in the night. Many times the moon hears
   strange music as it shines on those courts and terraces and pinnacles, but
   whether that music be the song of the god or the chant of the cryptical
   priests, none but the King of Ilek-Vad may say; for only he had entered
   the temple or seen the priests. Now, in the drowsiness of day, that carven
   and delicate fane was silent, and Carter heard only the murmur of the
   great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walked onward under
   the enchanted sun.

   All that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and in
   the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages and
   the shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl. Sometimes
   he walked close to the bank of Oukianos and whistled to the sprightly and
   iridescent fish of that crystal stream, and at other times he paused
   amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great dark wood on the
   farther side, whose trees came down clear to the water's edge. In former
   dreams he had seen quaint lumbering buopoths come shyly out of that wood
   to drink, but now he could not glimpse any. Once in a while he paused to
   watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing bird, which it lured to the water
   by showing its tempting scales in the sun, and grasped by the beak with
   its enormous mouth as the winged hunter sought to dart down upon it.

   Toward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in
   the sunset the thousand gilded spires of Thran. Lofty beyond belief are
   the alabaster walls of that incredible city, sloping inward toward the top
   and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows, for they are
   more ancient than memory. Yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates
   and two hundred turrets, the clustered towers within, all white beneath
   their golden spires, are loftier still; so that men on the plain around
   see them soaring into the sky, sometimes shining clear, sometimes caught
   at the top in tangles of cloud and mist, and sometimes clouded lower down
   with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above the vapours. And where
   Thran's gates open on the river are great wharves of marble, with ornate
   galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander riding gently at anchor, and
   strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of
   far places. Landward beyond the walls lies the farm country, where small
   white cottages dream between little hills, and narrow roads with many
   stone bridges wind gracefully among streams and gardens.

   Down through this verdant land Carter walked at evening, and saw twilight
   float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of Thran. And just
   at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate, and was stopped by a
   red-robed sentry till he had told three dreams beyond belief, and proved
   himself a dreamer worthy to walk up Thran's steep mysterious streets and
   linger in the bazaars where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold.
   Then into that incredible city he walked; through a wall so thick that the
   gate was a tunnel, and thereafter amidst curved and undulant ways winding
   deep and narrow between the heavenward towers. Lights shone through grated
   and balconied windows, and,the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from
   inner courts where marble fountains bubbled. Carter knew his way, and
   edged down through darker streets to the river, where at an old sea tavern
   he found the captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams.
   There he bought his passage to Celephais on a great green galleon, and
   there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat
   of that inn, who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of
   old wars and forgotten gods.

   In the morning Carter boarded the galleon bound for Celephais, and sat in
   the prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the
   Cerenerian Sea begun. For many leagues the banks were much as they were
   above Thran, with now and then a curious temple rising on the farther
   hills toward the right, and a drowsy village on the shore, with steep red
   roofs and nets spread in the sun. Mindful of his search, Carter questioned
   all the mariners closely about those whom they had met in the taverns of
   Celephais, asking the names and ways of the strange men with long, narrow
   eyes, long-lobed ears, thin noses, and pointed chins who came in dark
   ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and
   little red singing birds of Celephais. Of these men the sailors knew not
   much, save that they talked but seldom and spread a kind of awe about
   them.

   Their land, very far away, was called Inquanok, and not many people cared
   to go thither because it was a cold twilight land, and said to be close to
   unpleasant Leng; although high impassable mountains towered on the side
   where Leng was thought to lie, so that none might say whether this evil
   plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable monastery were
   really there, or whether the rumour were only a fear that timid people
   felt in the night when those formidable barrier peaks loomed black against
   a rising moon. Certainly, men reached Leng from very different oceans. Of
   other boundaries of Inquanok those sailors had no notion, nor had they
   heard of the cold waste and unknown Kadath save from vague unplaced
   report. And of the marvellous sunset city which Carter sought they knew
   nothing at all. So the traveller asked no more of far things, but bided
   his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and twilight
   Inquanok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on
   Ngranek.

   Late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which
   traverse the perfumed jungles of Kied. Here Carter wished he might
   disembark, for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory,
   lone and unbroken, where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name
   is forgotten. Spells of the Elder Ones keep those places unharmed and
   undecayed, for it is written that there may one day be need of them again;
   and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight, though
   none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to which their
   wholeness is due. But the ship swept on, and dusk hushed the hum of the
   day, and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies on
   the banks as that jungle fell far behind, leaving only its fragrance as a
   memory that it had been. And all through the night that galleon floated on
   past mysteries unseen and unsuspected. Once a lookout reported fires on
   the hills to the east, but the sleepy captain said they had better not be
   looked at too much, since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit
   them.

   In the morning the river had broadened out greatly, and Carter saw by the
   houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of
   Hlanith on the Cerenerian Sea. Here the walls are of rugged granite, and
   the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables. The men of
   Hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in
   dreamland; so that the city is not sought except for barter, but is prized
   for the solid work of its artisans. The wharves of Hlanith are of oak, and
   there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns.
   Carter also went ashore, and looked curiously upon the rutted streets
   where wooden ox carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares
   vacuously in the bazaars. The sea taverns were all close to the wharves on
   cobbled lanes salted with the spray of high tides, and seemed exceedingly
   ancient with their low black-beamed ceilings and casements of greenish
   bull's-eye panes. Ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant
   ports, and told many stories of the curious men from twilight Inquanok,
   but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told. Then at
   last, after much unloading and loading, the ship set sail once more over
   the sunset sea, and the high walls and gables of Hlanith grew less as the
   last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men
   had given them.

   Two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the Cerenerian Sea,
   sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel. Then near sunset of
   the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of Aran with its
   gingko-trees swaying on the lower slope, and Carter knew that they were
   come to the land of Ooth-Nargai and the marvellous city of Celephais.
   Swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous
   town, and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues, and the
   great stone bridge where Naraxa joins the sea. Then rose the gentle hills
   behind the town, with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small
   shrines and cottages upon them; and far in the background the purple ridge
   of the Tanarians, potent and mystical, behind which lay forbidden ways
   into the waking world and toward other regions of dream.

   The harbour was full of painted galleys, some of which were from the
   marble cloud-city of Serannian, that lies in ethereal space beyond where
   the sea meets the sky, and some of which were from more substantial parts
   of dreamland. Among these the steersman threaded his way up to the
   spice-fragrant wharves, where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the
   city's million lights began to twinkle out over the water. Ever new seemed
   this deathless city of vision, for here time has no power to tarnish or
   destroy. As it has always been is still the turquoise of Nath-Horthath,
   and the eighty orchid-wreathed priests are the same who builded it ten
   thousand years ago. Shining still is the bronze of the great gates, nor
   are the onyx pavements ever worn or broken. And the great bronze statues
   on the walls look down on merchants and camel drivers older than fable,
   yet without one grey hair in their forked beards.

   Carter did not once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel, but
   stayed by the seaward wall among traders and sailors. And when it was too
   late for rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he knew well,
   and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown Kadath whom he sought. The
   next day he searched all along the quays for some of the strange mariners
   of Inquanok, but was told that none were now in port, their galley not
   being due from the north for full two weeks. He found, however, one
   Thorabonian sailor who had been to Inquanok and had worked in the onyx
   quarries of that twilight place; and this sailor said there was certainly
   a descent to the north of the peopled region, which everybody seemed to
   fear and shun. The Thorabonian opined that this desert led around the
   utmost rim of impassable peaks into Leng's horrible plateau, and that this
   was why men feared it; though he admitted there were other vague tales of
   evil presences and nameless sentinels. Whether or not this could be the
   fabled waste wherein unknown Kadath stands he did not know; but it seemed
   unlikely that those presences and sentinels, if indeed they existed, were
   stationed for nought.

   On the following day Carter walked up the Street of the Pillars to the
   turquoise temple and talked with the High-Priest. Though Nath-Horthath is
   chiefly worshipped in Celephais, all the Great Ones are mentioned in
   diurnal prayers; and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods. Like
   Atal in distant Ulthar, he strongly advised against any attempts to see
   them; declaring that they are testy and capricious, and subject to strange
   protection from the mindless Other Gods from Outside, whose soul and
   messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Their jealous hiding of the
   marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did not wish Carter to
   reach it, and it was doubtful how they would regard a guest whose object
   was to see them and plead before them. No man had ever found Kadath in the
   past, and it might be just as well if none ever found it in the future.
   Such rumours as were told about that onyx castle of the Great Ones were
   not by any means reassuring.

   Having thanked the orchid-crowned High-Priest, Carter left the temple and
   sought out the bazaar of the sheep-butchers, where the old chief of
   Celephais' cats dwelt sleek and contented. That grey and dignified being
   was sunning himself on the onyx pavement, and extended a languid paw as
   his caller approached. But when Carter repeated the passwords and
   introductions furnished him by the old cat general of Ulthar, the furry
   patriarch became very cordial and communicative; and told much of the
   secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of Ooth-Nargai. Best of
   all, he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid waterfront
   cats of Celephais about the men of Inquanok, on whose dark ships no cat
   will go.

   It seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them, though that
   is not the reason why no cat will sail on their ships. The reason for this
   is that Inquanok holds shadows which no cat can endure, so that in all
   that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or a homely mew.
   Whether it be because of things wafted over the impassable peaks from
   hypothetical Leng, or because of things filtering down from the chilly
   desert to the north, none may say; but it remains a fact that in that far
   land there broods a hint of outer space which cats do not like, and to
   which they are more sensitive than men. Therefore they will not go on the
   dark ships that seek the basalt quays of Inquanok.

   The old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend King
   Kuranes, who in Carter's latter dreams had reigned alternately in the
   rose-crystal Palace of the Seventy Delights at Celephais and in the
   turreted cloud-castle of sky-floating Serannian. It seemed that he could
   no more find content in those places, but had formed a mighty longing for
   the English cliffs and downlands of his boyhood; where in little dreaming
   villages England's old songs hover at evening behind lattice windows, and
   where grey church towers peep lovely through the verdure of distant
   valleys. He could not go back to these things in the waking world because
   his body was dead; but he had done the next best thing and dreamed a small
   tract of such countryside in the region east of the city where meadows
   roll gracefully up from the sea-cliffs to the foot of the Tanarian Hills.
   There he dwelt in a grey Gothic manor-house of stone looking on the sea,
   and tried to think it was ancient Trevor Towers, where he was born and
   where thirteen generations of his forefathers had first seen the light.
   And on the coast nearby he had built a little Cornish fishing village with
   steep cobbled ways, settling therein such people as had the most English
   faces, and seeking ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of old
   Cornwall fishers. And in a valley not far off he had reared a great Norman
   Abbey whose tower he could see from his window, placing around it in the
   churchyard grey stones with the names of his ancestors carved thereon, and
   with a moss somewhat like Old England's moss. For though Kuranes was a
   monarch in the land of dream, with all imagined pomps and marvels,
   splendours and beauties, ecstasies and delights, novelties and excitements
   at his command, he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his
   power and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that
   pure and quiet England, that ancient, beloved England which had moulded
   his being and of which he must always be immutably a part.

   So when Carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu, he did not seek
   the terraced palace of rose crystal but walked out the eastern gate and
   across the daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he glimpsed through
   the oaks of a park sloping up to the sea-cliffs. And in time he came to a
   great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge, and when he rang the
   bell there hobbled to admit him no robed and annointed lackey of the
   palace, but a small stubby old man in a smock who spoke as best he could
   in the quaint tones of far Cornwall. And Carter walked up the shady path
   between trees as near as possible to England's trees, and clumbed the
   terraces among gardens set out as in Queen Anne's time. At the door,
   flanked by stone cats in the old way, he was met by a whiskered butler in
   suitable livery; and was presently taken to the library where Kuranes,
   Lord of Ooth-Nargai and the Sky around Serannian, sat pensive in a chair
   by the window looking on his little seacoast village and wishing that his
   old nurse would come in and scold him because he was not ready for that
   hateful lawn-party at the vicar's, with the carriage waiting and his
   mother nearly out of patience.

   Kuranes, clad in a dressing gown of the sort favoured by London tailors in
   his youth, rose eagerly to meet his guest; for the sight of an Anglo-Saxon
   from the waking world was very dear to him, even if it was a Saxon from
   Boston, Massachusetts, instead of from Cornwall. And for long they talked
   of old times, having much to say because both were old dreamers and well
   versed in the wonders of incredible places. Kuranes, indeed, had been out
   beyond the stars in the ultimate void, and was said to be the only one who
   had ever returned sane from such a voyage.

   At length Carter brought up the subject of his quest, and asked of his
   host those questions he had asked of so many others. Kuranes did not know
   where Kadath was, or the marvellous sunset city; but he did know that the
   Great Ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out, and that the Other
   Gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent curiosity. He
   had learned much of the Other Gods in distant parts of space, especially
   in that region where form does not exist, and coloured gases study the
   innermost secrets. The violet gas S'ngac had told him terrible things of
   the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep, and had warned him never to approach the
   central void where the daemon sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark.

   Altogether, it was not well to meddle with the Elder Ones; and if they
   persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city, it were
   better not to seek that city.

   Kuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by coming
   to the city even were he to gain it. He himself had dreamed and yearned
   long years for lovely Celephais and the land of Ooth-Nargai, and for the
   freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of its chains, and
   conventions, and stupidities. But now that he was come into that city and
   that land, and was the king thereof, he found the freedom and the
   vividness all too soon worn out, and monotonous for want of linkage with
   anything firm in his feelings and memories. He was a king in Ooth-Nargai,
   but found no meaning therein, and drooped always for the old familiar
   things of England that had shaped his youth. All his kingdom would he give
   for the sound of Cornish church bells over the downs, and all the thousand
   minarets of Celephais for the steep homely roofs of the village near his
   home. So he told his guest that the unknown sunset city might not hold
   quite that content he sought, and that perhaps it had better remain a
   glorious and half-remembered dream. For he had visited Carter often in the
   old waking days, and knew well the lovely New England slopes that had
   given him birth.

   At the last, he was very certain, the seeker would long only for the early
   remembered scenes; the glow of Beacon Hill at evening, the tall steeples
   and winding hill streets of quaint Kingsport, the hoary gambrel roofs of
   ancient and witch-haunted Arkham, and the blessed meads and valleys where
   stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables peeped out from bowers of
   verdure. These things he told Randolph Carter, but still the seeker held
   to his purpose. And in the end they parted each with his own conviction,
   and Carter went back through the bronze gate into Celephais and down the
   Street of Pillars to the old sea wall, where he talked more with the
   mariners of far ports and waited for the dark ship from cold and twilight
   Inquanok, whose strange-faced sailors and onyx-traders had in them the
   blood of the Great Ones.

   One starlit evening when the Pharos shone splendid over the harbour the
   longed-for ship put in, and strange-faced sailors and traders appeared one
   by one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the sea wall. It
   was very exciting to see again those living faces so like the godlike
   features of Ngranek, but Carter did not hasten to speak with the silent
   seamen. He did not know how much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal
   memory might fill those children of the Great Ones, and was sure it would
   not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask too closely of that cold
   desert stretching north of their twilight land. They talked little with
   the other folk in those ancient sea taverns; but would gather in groups in
   remote comers and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown
   places, or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of
   dreamland. And so rare and moving were those airs and tales that one might
   guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened, even though the
   words came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melody.

   For a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the
   bazaars of Celephais, and before they sailed Carter had taken passage on
   their dark ship, telling them that he was an old onyx miner and wishful to
   work in their quarries. That ship was very lovey and cunningly wrought,
   being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold, and the cabin
   in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet. One morning
   at the turn of the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lilted, and
   as Carter stood on the high stern he saw the sunrise-blazing walls and
   bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless Celephais sink into the
   distance, and the snowy peak of Mount Man grow smaller and smaller. By
   noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the Cerenerian
   Sea, with one painted galley afar off bound for that realm of Serannian
   where the sea meets the sky.

   And the night came with gorgeous stars, and the dark ship steered for
   Charles' Wain and the Little Bear as they swung slowly round the pole. And
   the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places, and they stole off one
   by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants
   and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers
   beneath the sea. Carter went to sleep at midnight, and rose in the glow of
   a young morning, marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its
   wont. And all through that second day he made progress in knowing the men
   of the ship, getting them little by little to talk of their cold twilight
   land, of their exquisite onyx city, and of their fear of the high and
   impassable peaks beyond which Leng was said to be. They told him how sorry
   they were that no cats would stay in the land of Inquanok, and how they
   thought the hidden nearness of Leng was to blame for it. Only of the stony
   desert to the north they would not talk. There was something disquieting
   about that desert, and it was thought expedient not to admit its
   existence.

   On later days they talked of the quarries in which Carter said he was
   going to work. There were many of them, for all the city of Inquanok was
   builded of onyx, whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in Rinar,
   Ogrothan, and Celephais and at home with the merchants of Thraa, Flarnek,
   and Kadatheron, for the beautiful wares of those fabulous ports. And far
   to the north, almost in the cold desert whose existence the men of
   Inquanok did not care to admit, there was an unused quarry greater than
   all the rest; from which had been hewn in forgotten times such prodigious
   lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled vacancies struck terror
   to all who beheld. Who had mined those incredible blocks, and whither they
   had been transported, no man might say; but it was thought best not to
   trouble that quarry, around which such inhuman memories might conceivably
   cling. So it was left all alone in the twilight, with only the raven and
   the rumoured Shantak-bird to brood on its immensities. when Carter heard
   of this quarry he was moved to deep thought, for he knew from old tales
   that the Great Ones' castle atop unknown Kadath is of onyx.

   Each day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky, and the mists
   overhead grew thicker and thicker. And in two weeks there was not any
   sunlight at all, but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome of
   eternal cloud by day, and a cold starless phosphorescence from the under
   side of that cloud by night. On the twentieth day a great jagged rock in
   the sea was sighted from afar, the first land glimpsed since Man's snowy
   peak had dwindled behind the ship. Carter asked the captain the name of
   that rock, but was told that it had no name and had never been sought by
   any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night. And when,
   after dark, a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged granite
   place, the traveller was glad that no stop had been made, and that the
   rock had no name. The seamen prayed and chanted till the noise was out of
   earshot, and Carter dreamed terrible dreams within dreams in the small
   hours.

   Two mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of
   great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that
   twilight world. And at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs, and
   some knelt down on the deck to pray, so that Carter knew they were come to
   the land of Inquanok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the
   great town bearing that land's name. Toward noon a dark coastline
   appeared, and before three o'clock there stood out against the north the
   bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx city. Rare and curious did
   that archaic city rise above its walls and quays, all of delicate black
   with scrolls, flutings, and arabesques of inlaid gold. Tall and
   many-windowed were the houses, and carved on every side with flowers and
   patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant
   than light. Some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point, others
   in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every
   phase of strangeness and imagination. The walls were low, and pierced by
   frequent gates, each under a great arch rising high above the general
   level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill
   displayed in the monstrous face on distant Ngranek. On a hill in the
   centre rose a sixteen-angled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a
   high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome. This, the seamen said,
   was the Temple of the Elder Ones, and was ruled by an old High-Priest sad
   with inner secrets.

   At intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city,
   answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns, viols, and
   chanting voices. And from a row of tripods on a galley round the high dome
   of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments; for the
   priests and people of that city were wise in the primal mysteries, and
   faithful in keeping the rhythms of the Great Ones as set forth in scrolls
   older than the Pnakotic Manuscripts. As the ship rode past the great
   basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of the city grew
   manifest, and Carter saw the slaves, sailors, and merchants on the docks.
   The sailors and merchants were of the strange-faced race of the gods, but
   the slaves were squat, slant-eyed folk said by rumour to have drifted
   somehow across or around the impassable peaks from the valleys beyond
   Leng. The wharves reached wide outside the city wall and bore upon them
   all manner of merchandise from the galleys anchored there, while at one
   end were great piles of onyx both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to
   the far markets of Rinar, Ograthan and Celephais.

   It was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting quay
   of stone, and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through the
   arched gate into the city. The streets of that city were paved with onyx
   and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were crooked and
   narrow. The houses near the water were lower than the rest, and bore above
   their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said to be in honour
   of the respective small gods that favoured each. The captain of the ship
   took Carter to an old sea tavern where flocked the mariners of quaint
   countries, and promised that he would next day shew him the wonders of the
   twilight city, and lead him to the taverns of the onyx-miners by the
   northern wall. And evening fell, and little bronze lamps were lighted, and
   the sailors in that tavern sang songs of remote places. But when from its
   high tower the great bell shivered over the city, and the peal of the
   horns and viols and voices rose cryptical in answer thereto, all ceased
   their songs or tales and bowed silent till the. last echo died away. For
   there is a wonder and a strangeness on the twilight city of Inquanok, and
   men fear to be lax in its rites lest a doom and a vengeance lurk
   unsuspectedly close.

   Far in the shadows of that tavern Carter saw a squat form he did not like,
   for it was unmistakably that of the old slant-eyed merchant he had seen so
   long before in the taverns of Dylath-Leen, who was reputed to trade with
   the horrible stone villages of Leng which no healthy folk visit and whose
   evil fires are seen at night from afar, and even to have dealt with that
   High-Priest Not To Be Described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its
   face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery. This man had
   seemed to shew a queer gleam of knowing when Carter asked the traders of
   DylathLeen about the cold waste and Kadath; and somehow his presence in
   dark and haunted Inquanok, so close to the wonders of the north, was not a
   reassuring thing. He slipped wholly out of sight before Carter could speak
   to him, and sailors later said that he had come with a yak caravan from
   some point not well determined, bearing the colossal and rich-flavoured
   eggs of the rumoured Shantak-bird to trade for the dextrous jade goblets
   that merchants brought from Ilarnek.

   On the following morning the ship-captain led Carter through the onyx
   streets of Inquanok, dark under their twilight sky. The inlaid doors and
   figured house-fronts, carven balconies and crystal-paned oriels all
   gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness; and now and then a plaza
   would open out with black pillars, colonades, and the statues of curious
   beings both human and fabulous. Some of the vistas down long and unbending
   streets, or through side alleys and over bulbous domes, spires, and
   arabesqued roofs, were weird and beautiful beyond words; and nothing was
   more splendid than the massive heights of the great central Temple of the
   Elder Ones with its sixteen carven sides, its flattened dome, and its
   lofty pinnacled belfry, overtopping all else, and majestic whatever its
   foreground. And always to the east, far beyond the city walls and the
   leagues of pasture land, rose the gaunt grey sides of those topless and
   impassable peaks across which hideous Leng was said to lie.

   The captain took Carter to the mighty temple, which is set with its walled
   garden in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes from a
   wheel's hub. The seven arched gates of that garden, each having over it a
   carven face like those on the city's gates, are always open, and the
   people roam reverently at will down the tiled paths and through the little
   lanes lined with grotesque termini and the shrines of modest gods. And
   there are fountains, pools, and basins there to reflect the frequent blaze
   of the tripods on the high balcony, all of onyx and having in them small
   luminous fish taken by divers from the lower bowers of ocean. When the
   deep clang from the temple belfry shivers over the garden and the city,
   and the answer of the horns and viols and voices peals out from the seven
   lodges by the garden gates, there issue from the seven doors of the temple
   long columns of masked and hooded priests in black, bearing at arm's
   length before them great golden bowls from which a curious steam rises.
   And all the seven columns strut peculiarly in single file, legs thrown far
   forward without bending the knees, down the walks that lead to the seven
   lodges, wherein they disappear and do not appear again. It is said that
   subterrene paths connect the lodges with the temple, and that the long
   files of priests return through them; nor is it unwhispered that deep
   flights of onyx steps go down to mysteries that are never told. But only a
   few are those who hint that the priests in the masked and hooded columns
   are not human beings.

   Carter did not enter the temple, because none but the Veiled King is
   permitted to do that. But before he left the garden the hour of the bell
   came, and he heard the shivering clang deafening above him, and the
   wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges by the
   gates. And down the seven great walks stalked the long files of
   bowl-bearing priests in their singular way, giving to the traveller a fear
   which human priests do not often give. When the last of them had vanished
   he left that garden, noting as he did so a spot on the pavement over which
   the bowls had passed. Even the ship-captain did not like that spot, and
   hurried him on toward the hill whereon the Veiled King's palace rises
   many-domed and marvellous.

   The ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow, all but the broad
   curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in yak-drawn
   chariots. Carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps,
   between inlaid walls hearing strange signs in gold, and under balconies
   and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of
   exotic fragrance. Always ahead loomed those titan walls, mighty
   buttresses, and clustered and bulbous domes for which the Veiled King's
   palace is famous; and at length they passed under a great black arch and
   emerged in the gardens of the monarch's pleasure. There Carter paused in
   faintness at so much beauty, for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks,
   the gay porterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden
   lattices, the brazen urns and tripods with cunning bas-reliefs, the
   pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black marble, the
   basalt-bottomed lagoon's tiled fountains with luminous fish, the tiny
   temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven columns, the marvellous
   scrollwork of the great bronze gates, and the blossoming vines trained
   along every inch of the polished walls all joined to form a sight whose
   loveliness was beyond reality, and half-fabulous even in the land of
   dreams. There it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky,
   with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead, and the
   fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right. And
   ever the small birds and the fountains sang, while the perfume of rare
   blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden. No other human
   presence was there, and Carter was glad it was so. Then they turned and
   descended again the onyx alley of steps, for the palace itself no visitor
   may enter; and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great
   central dome, since it is said to house the archaic father of all the
   rumoured Shantak-birds, and to send out queer dreams to the curious.

   After that the captain took Carter to the north quarter of the town, near
   the Gate of the Caravans, where are the taverns of the yak-merchants and
   the onyx-miners. And there, in a low-ceiled inn of quarrymen, they said
   farewell; for business called the captain whilst Carter was eager to talk
   with miners about the north. There were many men in that inn, and the
   traveller was not long in speaking to some of them; saying that he was an
   old miner of onyx, and anxious to know somewhat of Inquanok's quarries.
   But all that he learned was not much more than he knew before, for the
   miners were timid and evasive about the cold desert to the north and the
   quarry that no man visits. They had fears of fabled emissaries from around
   the mountains where Leng is said to lie, and of evil presences and
   nameless sentinels far north among the scattered rocks. And they whispered
   also that the rumoured Shantak-birds are no wholesome things; it being.
   indeed for the best that no man has ever truly seen one (for that fabled
   father of Shantaks in the king's dome is fed in the dark).

   The next day, saying that he wished to look over all the various mines for
   himself and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages of
   Inquanok, Carter hired a yak and stuffed great leathern saddle-bags for a
   journey. Beyond the Gate of the Caravans the road lay straight betwixt
   tilled fields, with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes. At some of
   these houses the seeker stopped to ask questions; once finding a host so
   austere and reticent, and so full of an unplaced majesty like to that in
   the huge features on Ngranek, that he felt certain he had come at last
   upon one of the Great Ones themselves, or upon one with full nine-tenths
   of their blood, dwelling amongst men. And to that austere and reticent
   cotter he was careful to speak very well of the gods, and to praise all
   the blessings they had ever accorded him.

   That night Carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great lygath-tree
   to which he tied his yak, and in the morning resumed his northward
   pilgrimage. At about ten o'clock he reached the small-domed village of
   Urg, where traders rest and miners tell their tales, and paused in its
   taverns till noon. It is here that the great caravan road turns west
   toward Selarn, but Carter kept on north by the quarry road. All the
   afternoon he followed that rising road, which was somewhat narrower than
   the great highway, and which now led through a region with more rocks than
   tilled fields. And by evening the low hills on his left had risen into
   sizable black cliffs, so that he knew he was close to the mining country.
   All the while the great gaunt sides of the impassable mountains towered
   afar off at his right, and the farther he went, the worse tales he heard
   of them from the scattered farmers and traders and drivers of lumbering
   onyx-carts along the way.

   On the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag,
   tethering his yak to a stake driven in the ground. He observed the greater
   phosphorescence of the clouds at his northerly point, and more than once
   thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them. And on the third morning
   he came in sight of the first onyx quarry, and greeted the men who there
   laboured with picks and chisels. Before evening he had passed eleven
   quarries; the land being here given over altogether to onyx cliffs and
   boulders, with no vegetation at all, but only great rocky fragments
   scattered about a floor of black earth, with the grey impassable peaks
   always rising gaunt and sinister on his right. The third night he spent in
   a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the
   polished cliffs to the west. And they sang many songs and told many tales,
   shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the habits of gods
   that Carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the
   Great Ones. They asked him whither he went, and cautioned him not to go
   too far to the north; but he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of
   onyx, and would take no more risks than were common among prospectors. In
   the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the darkening north, where
   they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence
   hands older than men's hands had wrenched prodigious blocks. But he did
   not like it when, turning back to wave a last farewell, he thought he saw
   approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting
   eyes, whose conjectured traffick with Leng was the gossip of distant
   Dylath-Leen.

   After two more quarries the inhabited part of Inquanok seemed to end, and
   the road narrowed to a steeply rising yak-path among forbidding black
   cliffs. Always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks, and as
   Carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm he found it
   grew darker and colder. Soon he perceived that there were no prints of
   feet or hooves on the black path beneath, and realised that he was indeed
   come into strange and deserted ways of elder time. Once in a while a raven
   would croak far overhead, and now and then a flapping behind some vast
   rock would make him think uncomfortably of the rumoured Shantak-bird. But
   in the main he was alone with his shaggy steed, and it troubled him to
   observe that this excellent yak became more and more reluctant to advance,
   and more and more disposed to snort affrightedly at any small noise along
   the route.

   The path now contracted between sable and glistening walls, and began to
   display an even greater steepness than before. It was a bad footing, and
   the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strewn thickly about. In two
   hours Carter saw ahead a definite crest, beyond which was nothing but dull
   grey sky, and blessed the prospect of a level or downward course. To reach
   this crest, however, was no easy task; for the way had grown nearly
   perpendicular, and was perilous with loose black gravel and small stones.
   Eventually Carter dismounted and led his dubious yak; pulling very hard
   when the animal balked or stumbled, and keeping his own footing as best he
   might. Then suddenly he came to the top and saw beyond, and gasped at what
   he saw.

   The path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down, with the same lines
   of high natural walls as before; but on the left hand there opened out a
   monstrous space, vast acres in extent, where some archaic power had riven
   and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a giant's quarry. Far
   back into the solid precipice ran that cyclopean gouge, and deep down
   within earth's bowels its lower delvings yawned. It was no quarry of man,
   and the concave sides were scarred with great squares, yards wide, which
   told of the size of the blocks once hewn by nameless hands and chisels.
   High over its jagged rim huge ravens flapped and croaked, and vague
   whirrings in the unseen depths told of bats or urhags or less mentionable
   presences haunting the endless blackness. There Carter stood in the narrow
   way amidst the twilight with the rocky path sloping down before him; tall
   onyx cliffs on his right that led on as far as he could see and tall
   cliffs on the left chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and
   unearthly quarry.

   All at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control, leaping past
   him and darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow slope
   toward the north. Stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over the brink
   of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any sound of
   striking bottom; but Carter ignored the perils of that scanty path as he
   raced breathlessly after the flying steed. Soon the left-behind cliffs
   resumed their course, making the way once more a narrow lane; and still
   the traveller leaped on after the yak whose great wide prints told of its
   desperate flight.

   Once he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast, and
   doubled his speed from this encouragement. He was covering miles, and
   little by little the way was broadening in front till he knew he must soon
   emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north. The gaunt grey flanks
   of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the right-hand
   crags, and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open space which was
   clearly a foretaste of the dark arid limitless plain. And once more those
   hoofbeats sounded in his ears, plainer than before, but this time giving
   terror instead of encouragement because he realised that they were not the
   frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak. The beats were ruthless and
   purposeful, and they were behind him.

   Carter's pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing, for
   though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence
   behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable. His yak must have
   heard or felt it first, and he did not like to ask himself whether it had
   followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up out of that black
   quarry pit. Meanwhile the cliffs had been left behind, so that the
   oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and spectral rocks wherein
   all paths were lost. He could not see the hoofprints of his yak, but
   always from behind him there came that detestable clopping; mingled now
   and then with what he fancied were titanic flappings and whirrings. That
   he was losing ground seemed unhappily clear to him, and he knew he was
   hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and
   untravelled sands. Only those remote and impassable peaks on the right
   gave him any sense of direction, and even they were less clear as the grey
   twilight waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its
   place.

   Then dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible
   thing. He had thought it for some moments a range of black mountains, but
   now he saw it was something more. The phosphorescence of the brooding
   clouds shewed it plainly, and even silhouetted parts of it as vapours
   glowed behind. How distant it was he could not tell, but it must have been
   very far. It was thousands of feet high, stretching in a great concave arc
   from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces, and had
   once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills. But now these hills were
   hills no more, for some hand greater than man's had touched them. Silent
   they squatted there atop the world like wolves or ghouls, crowned with
   clouds and mists and guarding the secrets of the north forever. All in a
   great half circle they squatted, those dog-like mountains carven into
   monstrous watching statues, and their right hands were raised in menace
   against mankind.

   It was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred
   double heads seem to move, but as Carter stumbled on he saw arise from
   their shadowy caps great forms whose motions were no delusion. Winged and
   whirring, those forms grew larger each moment, and the traveller knew his
   stumbling was at an end. They were not any birds or bats known elsewhere
   on earth or in dreamland, for they were larger than elephants and had
   heads like a horse's. Carter knew that they must be the Shantak-birds of
   ill rumour, and wondered no more what evil guardians and nameless
   sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert. And as he stopped in
   final resignation he dared at last to look behind him, where indeed was
   trotting the squat slant-eyed trader of evil legend, grinning astride a
   lean yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering Shantaks to whose wings
   still clung the rime and nitre of the nether pits.

   Trapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares that
   pressed around in great unholy circles, Randolph Carter did not lose
   consciousness. Lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered above him,
   while the slant-eyed merchant leaped down from his yak and stood grinning
   before the captive. Then the man motioned Carter to mount one of the
   repugnant Shantaks, helping him up as his judgement struggled with his
   loathing. It was hard work ascending, for the Shantak-bird has scales
   instead of feathers, and those scales are very slippery. Once he was
   seated, the slant-eyed man hopped up behind him, leaving the lean yak to
   be led away northward toward the ring of carven mountains by one of the
   incredible bird colossi.

   There now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space, endlessly up and
   eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond
   which Leng was said to be. Far above the clouds they flew, till at last
   there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of Inquanok
   have never seen, and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist.
   Carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below, and saw upon their
   topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of those on Ngranek; but
   he did not question his captor about these things when he noticed that
   both the man and the horse-headed Shantak appeared oddly fearful of them,
   hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they were left far
   in the rear.

   The Shantak now flew lower, revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey
   barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires. As they
   descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone
   villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light. And there came from
   those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of
   crotala which proved at once that Inquanok's people are right in their
   geographic rumours. For travellers have heard such sounds before, and know
   that they float only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never
   visit; that haunted place of evil and mystery which is Leng.

   Around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing, and Carter was curious as
   to what manner of beings they might be; for no healthy folk have ever been
   to Leng, and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen
   from afar. Very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap, and with an
   insane twisting and bending not good to behold; so that Carter did not
   wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend, or the fear
   in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau. As the
   Shantak flew lower, the repulsiveness of the dancers became tinged with a
   certain hellish familiarity; and the prisoner kept straining his eyes and
   racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures before.

   They leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet, and seemed to wear
   a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns. Of other clothing they had
   none, but most of them were quite furry. Behind they had dwarfish tails,
   and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width of their mouths.
   Then he knew what they were, and that they did not wear any wigs or
   headpieces after all. For the cryptic folk of Leng were of one race with
   the uncomfortable merchants of the black galleys that traded rubies at
   Dylath-Leen; those not quite human merchants who are the slaves of the
   monstrous moon-things! They were indeed the same dark folk who had
   shanghaied Carter on their noisome galley so long ago, and whose kith he
   had seen driven in herds about the unclean wharves of that accursed lunar
   city, with the leaner ones toiling and the fatter ones taken away in
   crates for other needs of their polypous and amorphous masters. Now he saw
   where such ambiguous creatures came from, and shuddered at the thought
   that Leng must be known to these formless abominations from the moon.

   But the Shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less
   than human dancers, and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and dim
   wastes of rock and ice and snow. Day came, and the phosphorescence of low
   clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern world, and still
   the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence. At times the
   slant-eyed man talked with his steed in a hateful and guttural language,
   and the Shantak would answer with tittering tones that rasped like the
   scratching of ground glass. AlI this while the land was getting higher,
   and finally they came to a wind-swept table-land which seemed the very
   roof of a blasted and tenantless world. There, all alone in the hush and
   the dusk and the cold, rose the uncouth stones of a squat windowless
   building, around which a circle of crude monoliths stood. In all this
   arrangement there was nothing human, and Carter surmised from old tales
   that he was indeed come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places,
   the remote and prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the
   High-Priest Not To Be Described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its
   face and prays to the Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.

   The loathsome bird now settled to the ground, and the slant-eyed man
   hopped down and helped his captive alight. Of the purpose of his seizure
   Carter now felt very sure; for clearly the slant-eyed merchant was an
   agent of the darker powers, eager to drag before his masters a mortal
   whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown Kadath and the
   saying of a prayer before the faces of the Great Ones in their onyx
   castle. It seemed likely that this merchant had caused his former capture
   by the slaves of the moon-things in Dylath-Leen, and that he now meant to
   do what the rescuing cats had baffled; taking the victim to some dread
   rendezvous with monstrous Nyarlathotep and telling with what boldness the
   seeking of unknown Kadath had been tried. Leng and the cold waste north of
   Inquanok must be close to the Other Gods, and there the passes to Kadath
   are well guarded.

   The slant-eyed man was small, but the great hippocephalic bird was there
   to see he was obeyed; so Carter followed where he led, and passed within
   the circle of standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of that
   windowless stone monastery. There were no lights inside, but the evil
   merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid bas-reliefs and prodded his
   prisoner on through mazes of narrow winding corridors. On the walls of the
   corridors were printed frightful scenes older than history, and in a style
   unknown to the archaeologists of earth. After countless aeons their
   pigments were brilliant still, for the cold and dryness of hideous Leng
   keep alive many primal things. Carter saw them fleetingly in the rays of
   that dim and moving lamp, and shuddered at the tale they told.

   Through those archaic frescoes Leng's annals stalked; and the horned,
   hooved, and wide-mouthed almost-humans danced evilly amidst forgotten
   cities. There were scenes of old wars, wherein Leng's almost-humans fought
   with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales; and there were
   scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon, and of the
   submission of Leng's people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that
   hopped and floundered and wriggled out of them. Those slippery
   greyish-white blasphemies they worshipped as gods, nor ever complained
   when scores of their best and fatted males were taken away in the black
   galleys. The monstrous moon-beasts made their camp on a jagged isle in the
   sea, and Carter could tell from the frescoes that this was none other than
   the lone nameless rock he had seen when sailing to Inquanok; that grey
   accursed rock which Inquanok's seamen shun, and from which vile howlings
   reverberate all through the night.

   And in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the
   almost-humans; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt
   wharves, and wondrous with high fanes and carven places. Great gardens and
   columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six
   sphinx-crowned gates to a vast central plaza, and in that plaza was a pair
   of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase. Again
   and again were those huge winged lions shewn, their mighty flanks of
   diarite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and the cloudy
   phosphorescence of the night. And as Carter stumbled past their frequent
   and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed they were, and
   what city it was that the almost-humans had ruled so anciently before the
   coming of the black galleys. There could be no mistake, for the legends of
   dreamland are generous and profuse. Indubitably that primal city was no
   less a place than storied Sarkomand, whose ruins had bleached for a
   million years before the first true human saw the light, and whose twin
   titan lions guard eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the
   Great Abyss.

   Other views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing Leng from Inquanok, and
   the monstrous Shantak-birds that build nests on the ledges half way up.
   And they shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost
   pinnacles, and how even the boldest of the Shantaks fly screaming away
   from them. Carter had seen those caves when he passed over them, and had
   noticed their likeness to the caves on Ngranek. Now he knew that the
   likeness was more than a chance one, for in these pictures were shewn
   their fearsome denizens; and those bat-wings, curving horns, barbed tails,
   prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not strange to him. He had met
   those silent, flitting and clutching creatures before; those mindless
   guardians of the Great Abyss whom even the Great Ones fear, and who own
   not Nyarlathotep but hoary Nodens as their lord. For they were the dreaded
   night-gaunts, who never laugh or smile because they have no faces, and who
   flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the Vale of Pnath and the passes to
   the outer world.

   The slant-eyed merchant had now prodded Carter into a great domed space
   whose walls were carved in shocking bas-reliefs, and whose centre held a
   gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars in a
   ring. There was no light in this vast evil-smelling crypt, and the small
   lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp details
   only little by little. At the farther end was a high stone dais reached by
   five steps; and there on a golden throne sat a lumpish figure robed in
   yellow silk figured with red and having a yellow silken mask over its
   face. To this being the slant-eyed man made certain signs with his hands,
   and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly carven flute
   of ivory in silk-covered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds from
   beneath its flowing yellow mask. This colloquy went on for some time, and
   to Carter there was something sickeningly familiar in the sound of that
   flute and the stench of the malodorous place. It made him think of a
   frightful red-litten city and of the revolting procession that once filed
   through it; of that, and of an awful climb through lunar countryside
   beyond, before the rescuing rush of earth's friendly cats. He knew that
   the creature on the dais was without doubt the High-Priest Not To Be
   Described, of which legend whispers such fiendish and abnormal
   possibilities, but he feared to think just what that abhorred High-Priest
   might be.

   Then the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyish-white paws,
   and Carter knew what the noisome High-Priest was. And in that hideous
   second, stark fear drove him to something his reason would never have
   dared to attempt, for in all his shaken consciousness there was room only
   for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that golden throne.
   He knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold
   table-land outside, and that even on that table-land the noxious Shantek
   still waited; yet in spite of all this there was in his mind only the
   instant need to get away from that wriggling, silk-robed monstrosity.

   The slant-eyed man had set the curious lamp upon one of the high and
   wickedly stained altar-stones by the pit, and had moved forward somewhat
   to talk to the High-Priest with his hands. Carter, hitherto wholly
   passive, now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild strength of
   fear, so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping well which
   rumour holds to reach down to the hellish Vaults of Zin where Gugs hunt
   ghasts in the dark. In almost the same second he seized the lamp from the
   altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths, racing this way and
   that as chance determined and trying not to think of the stealthy padding
   of shapeless paws on the stones behind him, or of the silent wrigglings
   and crawlings which must be going on back there in lightless corridors.

   After a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste, and wished he had
   tried to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in. True,
   they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have done him
   much good, but he wished none the less he had made the attempt. Those he
   now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then, and he knew
   he was not in the corridors leading outside. In time he became quite sure
   he was not followed, and slackened his pace somewhat; but scarce had he
   breathed in half relief when a new peril beset him. His lamp was waning,
   and he would soon be in pitch blackness with no means of sight or
   guidance.

   When the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark, and prayed to
   the Great Ones for such help as they might afford. At times he felt the
   stone floor sloping up or down, and once he stumbled over a step for which
   no reason seemed to exist. The farther he went the damper it seemed to be,
   and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he
   always chose the way which sloped downward the least. He believed, though,
   that his general course was down; and the vault-like smell and
   incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike warned him he was
   burrowing deep in Leng's unwholesome table-land. But there was not any
   warning of the thing which came at last; only the thing itself with its
   terror and shock and breath-taking chaos. One moment he was groping slowly
   over the slippery floor of an almost level place, and the next he was
   shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have
   been well-nigh vertical.

   Of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure, but it
   seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy. Then he
   realized he was still, with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night
   shining sickly above him. All around were crumbling walls and broken
   columns, and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass
   and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots. Behind him a basalt
   cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side sculptured into
   repellent scenes, and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the
   inner blacknesses out of which he had come. Ahead stretched double rows of
   pillars, and the fragments and pedestals of pillars, that spoke of a broad
   and bygone street; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it
   had been a great street of gardens. Far off at its end the pillars spread
   to mark a vast round plaza, and in that open circle there loomed gigantic
   under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things. Huge winged lions
   of diarite they were, with blackness and shadow between them. Full twenty
   feet they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads, and snarled derisive
   on the ruins around them. And Carter knew right well what they must be,
   for legend tells of only one such twain. They were the changeless
   guardians of the Great Abyss, and these dark ruins were in truth
   primordial Sarkomand.

   Carter's first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff
   with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around. He wished no follower
   from Leng's hateful monastery, for along the way ahead would lurk enough
   of other dangers. Of how to get from Sarkomand to the peopled parts of
   dreamland he knew nothing at all; nor could he gain much by descending to
   the grottoes of the ghouls, since he knew they were no better informed
   than he. The three ghouls which had helped him through the city of Gugs to
   the outer world had not known how to reach Sarkomand in their journey
   back, but had planned to ask old traders in Dylath-Leen. He did not like
   to think of going again to the subterrene world of Gugs and risking once
   more that hellish tower of Koth with its Cyclopean steps leading to the
   enchanted wood, yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else
   failed. Over Leng's plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go
   unaided; for the High-Priest's emissaries must be many, while at the
   journey's end there would no doubt be the Shantaks and perhaps other
   things to deal with. If he could get a boat he might sail back to Inquanok
   past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea, for the primal frescoes in
   the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far
   from Sarkomand's basalt quays. But to find a boat in this aeon-deserted
   city was no probable thing, and it did not appear likely that he could
   ever make one.

   Such were the thoughts of Randolph Carter when a new impression began
   beating upon his mind. All this while there had stretched before him the
   great corpse-like width of fabled Sarkomand with its black broken pillars
   and crumbling sphinx-crowned gates and titan stones and monstrous winged
   lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds. Now he saw
   far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for, and
   knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city. The glow rose and
   fell fitfully, flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the
   watcher. And when he crept closer, down the littered street and through
   some narrow gaps between tumbled walls, he perceived that it was a
   campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around
   it; and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all. Beyond was the oily
   lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor, and
   Carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of
   the dreaded black galleys from the moon.

   Then, just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame, he
   saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and
   unmistakable sound. It was the frightened meeping of a ghoul, and in a
   moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish. Secure as he was
   in the shadow of monstrous ruins, Carter allowed his curiosity to conquer
   his fear, and crept forward again instead of retreating. Once in crossing
   an open street he wriggled worm-like on his stomach, and in another place
   he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among heaps of fallen
   marble. But always he succeeded in avoiding discovery, so that in a short
   time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar where he could watch the
   whole green-litten scene of action. There around a hideous fire fed by the
   obnoxious stems of lunar fungi, there squatted a stinking circle of the
   toadlike moonbeasts and their almost-human slaves. Some of these slaves
   were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames, and at intervals
   applying their white-hot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that
   lay writhing before the leaders of the party. From the motions of their
   tentacles Carter could see that the blunt-snouted moonbeasts were enjoying
   the spectacle hugely, and vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised
   the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than
   the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss, and had
   thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to find Sarkomand and the gate
   to their native deeps.

   The number of malodorous moonbeasts about that greenish fire was very
   great, and Carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former
   allies. Of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess; but
   fancied that the grey toadlike blasphemies had heard them inquire in
   Dylath-Leen concerning the way to Sarkomand and had not wished them to
   approach so closely the hateful plateau of Leng and the High-Priest Not To
   Be Described. For a moment he pondered on what he ought to do, and
   recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls' black kingdom. Clearly
   it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and descend at once
   to the gulf, where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those
   above, and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren
   and perhaps to wipe out the moonbeasts from the black galley. It occurred
   to him that the portal, like other gates to the abyss, might be guarded by
   flocks of night-gaunts; but he did not fear these faceless creatures now.
   He had learned that they are bound by solemn treaties with the ghouls, and
   the ghoul which was Pickman had taught him how to glibber a password they
   understood.

   So Carter began another silent crawl through the ruins, edging slowly
   toward the great central plaza and the winged lions. It was ticklish work,
   but the moonbeasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the slight noises
   which he twice made by accident among the scattered stones. At last he
   reached the open space and picked his way among the stunned trees and
   vines that had grown up therein. The gigantic lions loomed terrible above
   him in the sickly glow of the phosphorescent night clouds, but he manfully
   persisted toward them and presently crept round to their faces, knowing it
   was on that side he would find the mighty darkness which they guard. Ten
   feet apart crouched the mocking-faced beasts of diarite, brooding on
   cyclopean pedestals whose sides were chiselled in fearsome bas-reliefs.
   Betwixt them was a tiled court with a central space which had once been
   railed with balusters of onyx. Midway in this space a black well opened,
   and Carter soon saw that he had indeed reached the yawning gulf whose
   crusted and mouldy stone steps lead down to the crypts of nightmare.

   Terrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore themselves
   away whilst Carter wound sightlessly round and round down a fathomless
   spiral of steep and slippery stairs. So worn and narrow were the steps,
   and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth, that the climber never quite
   knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the ultimate
   pits; and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian
   night-gaunts would suddenly pounce upon him, if indeed there were any
   stationed in this primeval passage. All about him was a stifling odour of
   nether gulfs, and he felt that the air of these choking depths was not
   made for mankind. In time he became very numb and somnolent, moving more
   from automatic impulse than from reasoned will; nor did he realize any
   change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly seized him
   from behind. He was flying very rapidly through the air before a
   malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery night-gaunts had performed
   their duty.

   Awaked to the fact that he was in the cold, damp clutch of the faceless
   flutterers, Carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it
   as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight. Mindless though
   night-gaunts are said to be, the effect was instantaneous; for all
   tickling stopped at once, and the creatures hastened to shift their
   captive to a more comfortable position. Thus encouraged Carter ventured
   some explanations; telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls by
   the moonbeasts, and of the need of assembling a party to rescue them. The
   night-gaunts, though inarticulate, seemed to understand what was said; and
   shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight. Suddenly the dense
   blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth, and there opened
   up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat
   and gnaw. Scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens
   of that place; and as Carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons, a score
   of burrows emptied forth their leathery, dog-like tenants. The
   night-gaunts now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet, afterward
   withdrawing a little and forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while
   the ghouls greeted the newcomer.

   Carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque
   company, and four of them at once departed through different burrows to
   spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for
   a rescue. After a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared, and made
   significant signs to the night-gaunts, causing two of the latter to fly
   off into the dark. Thereafter there were constant accessions to the
   hunched flock of night-gaunts on the plain, till at length the slimy soil
   was fairly black with them. Meanwhile fresh ghouls crawled out of the
   burrows one by one, all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude battle
   array not far from the huddled night-gaunts. In time there appeared that
   proud and influential ghoul which was once the artist Richard Pickman of
   Boston, and to him Carter glibbered a very full account of what had
   occurred. The erstwhile Pickman, pleased to greet his ancient friend
   again, seemed very much impressed, and held a conference with other chiefs
   a little apart from the growing throng.

   Finally, after scanning the ranks with care, the assembled chiefs all
   meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and
   night-gaunts. A large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at once,
   while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees with extended
   forelegs, awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one. As each ghoul
   reached the pair of night-gaunts to which he was assigned, he was taken up
   and borne away into the blackness; till at last the whole throng had
   vanished save for Carter, Pickman, and the other chiefs, and a few pairs
   of night-gaunts. Pickman explained that night-gaunts are the advance guard
   and battle steeds of the ghouls, and that the army was issuing forth to
   Sarkomand to deal with the moonbeasts. Then Carter and the ghoulish chiefs
   approached the waiting bearers and were taken up by the damp, slippery
   paws. Another moment and all were whirling in wind and darkness; endlessly
   up, up, up to the gate of the winged and the special ruins of primal
   Sarkomand.

   When, after a great interval, Carter saw again the sickly light of
   Sarkomand's nocturnal sky, it was to behold the great central plaza
   swarming with militant ghouls and night-gaunts. Day, he felt sure, must be
   almost due; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would
   be needed. The greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly,
   though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the
   prisoners was over for the nonce. Softly glibbering directions to their
   steeds and to the flock of riderless night-gaunts ahead, the ghouls
   presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins
   toward the evil flame. Carter was now beside Pickman in the front rank of
   ghouls, and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the moonbeasts
   were totally unprepared. The three prisoners lay bound and inert beside
   the fire, while their toadlike captors slumped drowsily about in no
   certain order. The almost-human slaves were asleep, even the sentinels
   shirking a duty which in this realm must have seemed to them merely
   perfunctory.

   The final swoop of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden,
   each of the greyish toadlike blasphemies and their almost-human slaves
   being seized by a group of night-gaunts before a sound was made. The
   moonbeasts, of course, were voiceless; and even the slaves had little
   chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence. Horrible
   were the writhings of those great jellyfish abnormalities as the sardonic
   night-gaunts clutched them, but nothing availed against the strength of
   those black prehensile talons. When a moonbeast writhed too violently, a
   night-gaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles; which
   seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles. Carter
   expected to see much slaughter, but found that the ghouls were far subtler
   in their plans. They glibbered certain simple orders to the night-gaunts
   which held the captives, trusting the rest to instinct; and soon the
   hapless creatures were borne silently away into the Great Abyss, to be
   distributed impartially amongst the Dholes, Gugs, ghasts and other
   dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their
   chosen victims. Meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and
   consoled by their conquering kinsfolk, whilst various parties searched the
   neighborhood for possible remaining moonbeasts, and boarded the
   evil-smelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had
   escaped the general defeat. Surely enough, the capture had been thorough,
   for not a sign of further life could the victors detect. Carter, anxious
   to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland, urged them not to
   sink the anchored galley; and this request was freely granted out of
   gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio. On the
   ship were found some very curious objects and decorations, some of which
   Carter cast at once into the sea.

   Ghouls and night-gaunts now formed themselves in separate groups, the
   former questioning their rescued fellow anent past happenings. It appeared
   that the three had followed Carter's directions and proceeded from the
   enchanted wood to Dylath-Leen by way of Nir and the Skin, stealing human
   clothes at a lonely farmhouse and loping as closely as possible in the
   fashion of a man's walk. In Dylath-Leen's taverns their grotesque ways and
   faces had aroused much comment; but they had persisted in asking the way
   to Sarkomand until at last an old traveller was able to tell them. Then
   they knew that only a ship for Lelag-Leng would serve their purpose, and
   prepared to wait patiently for such a vessel.

   But evil spies had doubtless reported much; for shortly a black galley put
   into port, and the wide-mouthed ruby merchants invited the ghouls to drink
   with them in a tavern. Wine was produced from one of those sinister
   bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby, and after that the ghouls
   found themselves prisoners on the black galley as Carter had found
   himself. This time, however, the unseen rowers steered not for the moon
   but for antique Sarkomand; bent evidently on taking their captives before
   the High-Priest Not To Be Described. They had touched at the jagged rock
   in the northern sea which Inquanok's mariners shun, and the ghouls had
   there seen for the first time the red masters of the ship; being sickened
   despite their own callousness by such extremes of malign shapelessness and
   fearsome odour. There, too, were witnessed the nameless pastimes of the
   toadlike resident garrison-such pastimes as give rise to the
   night-howlings which men fear. After that had come the landing at ruined
   Sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures, whose continuance the present
   rescue had prevented.

   Future plans were next discussed, the three rescued ghouls suggesting a
   raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toadlike garrison
   there. To this, however, the night-gaunts objected; since the prospect of
   flying over water did not please them. Most of the ghouls favoured the
   design, but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the winged
   night-gaunts. Thereupon Carter, seeing that they could not navigate the
   anchored galley, offered to teach them the use of the great banks of oars;
   to which proposal they eagerly assented. Grey day had now come, and under
   that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of ghouls filed into the
   noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers' benches. Carter found
   them fairly apt at learning, and before night had risked several
   experimental trips around the harbour. Not till three days later, however,
   did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of conquest. Then, the rowers
   trained and the night-gaunts safely stowed in the forecastle, the party
   set sail at last; Pickman and the other chiefs gathering on deck and
   discussing models of approach and procedure.

   On the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard. Such was
   their timbre that all the galley's crew shook visibly; but most of all
   trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those howlings
   meant. It was not thought best to attempt an attack by night, so the ship
   lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn of a greyish
   day. when the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed
   their strokes, and the galley drew closer and closer to that jagged rock
   whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the dull sky. The sides of
   the rock were very steep; but on ledges here and there could be seen the
   bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings, and the low railings guarding
   travelled highroads. No ship of men had ever come so near the place, or at
   least, had never come so near and departed again; but Carter and the
   ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on, rounding the eastern face
   of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio described as
   being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlands.

   The headlands were prolongations of the island proper, and came so closely
   together that only one ship at a time might pass between them. There
   seemed to be no watchers on the outside, so the galley was steered boldly
   through the flume-like strait and into the stagnant putrid harbour beyond.
   Here, however, all was bustle and activity; with several ships lying at
   anchor along a forbidding stone quay, and scores of almost-human slaves
   and moonbeasts by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving
   nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering lorries. There was a
   small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the wharves, with
   the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher
   ledges of the rock. Of what lay inside that prodigious peak of granite
   none might say, but the things one saw on the outside were far from
   encouraging.

   At sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much
   eagerness; those with eyes staring intently, and those without eyes
   wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly. They did not, of course,
   realize that the black ship had changed hands; for ghouls look much like
   the horned and hooved almost-humans, and the night-gaunts were all out of
   sight below. By this time the leaders had fully formed a plan; which was
   to loose the night-gaunts as soon as the wharf was touched, and then to
   sail directly away, leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those
   almost-mindless creatures. Marooned on the rock, the horned flyers would
   first of all seize whatever living things they found there, and afterward,
   quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct, would
   forget their fears of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss; bearing
   their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark, from which not
   much would emerge alive.

   The ghoul that was Pickman now went below and gave the night-gaunts their
   simple instructions, while the ship drew very near to the ominous and
   malodorous wharves. Presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront, and
   Carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion.
   Evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock, and probably
   the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the
   almost-human slaves whose places they were taking. Some silent alarm must
   have been given, for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moonbeasts
   began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses and
   down the winding road at the right. A rain of curious javelins struck the
   galley as the prow hit the wharf felling two ghouls and slightly wounding
   another; but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a
   black cloud of whirring night-gaunts which swarmed over the town like a
   flock of horned and cyclopean bats.

   The jellyish moonbeasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push
   off the invading ship, but when the night-gaunts struck them they thought
   of such things no more. It was a very terrible spectacle to see those
   faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime, and tremendously
   impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and
   up the winding roadway to the reaches above. Sometimes a group of the
   black flutterers would drop a toadlike prisoner from aloft by mistake, and
   the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the
   sight and smell. When the last of the night-gaunts had left the galley the
   ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal, and the rowers pulled
   quietly out of the harbour between the grey headlands while still the town
   was a chaos of battle and conquest.

   The Pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the night-gaunts to make up
   their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea,
   and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he
   waited, and dressed the wounds of the injured men. Night fell, and the
   grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds, and
   all the while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed rock for
   signs of the night-gaunts' flight. Toward morning a black speck was seen
   hovering timidly over the top-most pinnacle, and shortly afterward the
   speck had become a swarm. Just before daybreak the swarm seemed to
   scatter, and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished wholly in the
   distance toward the northeast. Once or twice something seemed to fall from
   the thing swarm into the sea; but Carter did not worry, since he knew from
   observation that the toadlike moonbeasts cannot swim. At length, when the
   ghouls were satisfied that all the night-gaunts had left for Sarkomand and
   the Great Abyss with their doomed burdens, the galley put back into the
   harbour betwixt the grey headlands; and all the hideous company landed and
   roamed curiously over the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and
   fortresses chiselled from the solid stone.

   Frightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless crypts;
   for the remnants of unfinished pastimes were many, and in various stages
   of departure from their primal state. Carter put out of the way certain
   things which were after a fashion alive, and fled precipitately from a few
   other things about which he could not be very positive. The stench-filled
   houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from
   moon-trees, and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs.
   Countless weapons, implements, and ornaments lay about, including some
   large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not found on the
   earth. These latter did not, despite their material, invite either
   appropriation or long inspection; and Carter took the trouble to hammer
   five of them into very small pieces. The scattered spears and javelins he
   collected, and with Pickman's approval distributed among the ghouls. Such
   devices were new to the doglike lopers, but their relative simplicity made
   them easy to master after a few concise hints.

   The upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes, and in
   numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully
   stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more monstrous than
   the wild gods atop Kadath. From the rear of one great temple stretched a
   low black passage which Carter followed far into the rock with a torch
   till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast proportions, whose
   vaultings were covered with demoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a
   foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous monastery of Leng where
   broods alone the High-Priest Not To Be Described. On the distant shadowy
   side, beyond the noisome well, he thought he discerned a small door of
   strangely wrought bronze; but for some reason he felt an unaccountable
   dread of opening it or even approaching it, and hastened back through the
   cavern to his unlovely allies as they shambled about with an ease and
   abandon he could scarcely feel. The ghouls had observed the unfinished
   pastimes of the moonbeasts, and had profited in their fashion. They had
   also found a hogshead of potent moon-wine, and were rolling it down to the
   wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings, though the
   rescued trio, remembering its effect on them in Dylath-Leen, had warned
   their company to taste none of it. Of rubies from lunar mines there was a
   great store, both rough and polished, in one of the vaults near the water;
   but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest
   in them. Carter did not try to carry any away, since he knew too much
   about those which had mined them.

   Suddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the wharves,
   and all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to stare seaward
   and cluster round the waterfront. Betwixt the grey headlands a fresh black
   galley was rapidly advancing, and it would be but a moment before the
   almost-humans on deck would perceive the invasion of the town and give the
   alarm to the monstrous things below. Fortunately the ghouls still bore the
   spears and javelins which Carter had distributed amongst them; and at his
   command, sustained by the being that was Pickman, they now formed a line
   of battle and prepared to prevent the landing of the ship. Presently a
   burst of excitement on the galley told of the crew's discovery of the
   changed state of things, and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved
   that the superior numbers of the ghouls had been noted and taken into
   account. After a moment of hesitation the new comers silently turned and
   passed out between the headlands again, but not for an instant did the
   ghouls imagine that the conflict was averted. Either the dark ship would
   seek reinforcements or the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island;
   hence a party of scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see
   what the enemy's course would be.

   In a very few minutes the ghoul returned breathless to say that the
   moonbeasts and almost-humans were landing on the outside of the more
   easterly of the rugged grey headlands, and ascending by hidden paths and
   ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety. Almost immediately
   afterward the galley was sighted again through the flume-like strait, but
   only for a second. Then a few moments later, a second messenger panted
   down from aloft to say that another party was landing on the other
   headland; both being much more numerous than the size of the galley would
   seem to allow for. The ship itself, moving slowly with only one sparsely
   manned tier of oars, soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs, and lay to in
   the foetid harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for any
   possible use.

   By this time Carter and Pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties,
   one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain in the
   town. The first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their respective
   directions, while the third was subdivided into a land party and a sea
   party. The sea party, commanded by Carter, boarded the anchored galley and
   rowed out to meet the under-manned galley of the newcomers; whereat the
   latter retreated through the strait to the open sea. Carter did not at
   once pursue it, for he knew he might be needed more acutely near the town.

   Meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moonbeasts and almost-humans
   had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly
   silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky. The thin hellish
   flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine, and the general effect of
   those hybrid, half-amorphous processions was as nauseating as the actual
   odour given off by the toadlike lunar blasphemies. Then the two parties of
   the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted panorama.
   Javelins began to fly from both sides, and the swelling meeps of the
   ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost-humans gradually joined the
   hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of
   daemon cacophony. Now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the
   headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside, in the latter case
   being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was
   indicated only by prodigious bubbles.

   For half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky, till upon the west
   cliff the invaders were completely annihilated. On the east cliff,
   however, where the leader of the moonbeast party appeared to be present,
   the ghouls had not fared so well; and were slowly retreating to the slopes
   of the pinnacle proper. Pickman had quickly ordered reinforcements for
   this front from the party in the town, and these had helped greatly in the
   earlier stages of the combat. Then, when the western battle was over, the
   victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of their hard-pressed
   fellows; turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again along the
   narrow ridge of the headland. The almost-humans were by this time all
   slain, but the last of the toadlike horrors fought desperately with the
   great spears clutched in their powerful and disgusting paws. The time for
   javelins was now nearly past, and the fight became a hand-to-hand contest
   of what few spearmen could meet upon that narrow ridge.

   As fury and recklessness increased, the number falling into the sea became
   very great. Those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the
   unseen bubblers, but of those striking the open sea some were able to swim
   to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks, while the hovering
   galley of the enemy rescued several moonbeasts. The cliffs were unscalable
   except where the monsters had debarked, so that none of the ghouls on the
   rocks could rejoin their battle-line. Some were killed by javelins from
   the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts above, but a few survived to be
   rescued. When the security of the land parties seemed assured, Carter's
   galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove the hostile ship far
   out to sea; pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks or still
   swimming in the ocean. Several moonbeasts washed on rocks or reefs were
   speedily put out of the way.

   Finally, the moonbeast galley being safely in the distance and the
   invading land army concentrated in one place, Carter landed a considerable
   force on the eastern headland in the enemy's rear; after which the fight
   was short-lived indeed. Attacked from both sides, the noisome flounderers
   were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea, till by evening the
   ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them. The
   hostile galley, meanwhile, had disappeared; and it was decided that the
   evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any overwhelming horde of
   lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victors.

   So by night Pickman and Carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them
   with care, finding that over a fourth had been lost in the day's battles.
   The wounded were placed on bunks in the galley, for Pickman always
   discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating one's own
   wounded, and the able-bodied troops were assigned to the oars or to such
   other places as they might most usefully fill. Under the low
   phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed, and Carter was not sorry
   to be departing from the island of unwholesome secrets, whose lightless
   domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door lingered
   restlessly in his fancy. Dawn found the ship in sight of Sarkomand's
   ruined quays of basalt, where a few night-gaunt sentries still waited,
   squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken columns and crumbling
   sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and died before the years of
   man.

   The ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of Sarkomand, despatching a
   messenger for enough night-gaunts to serve them as steeds. Pickman and the
   other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude for the aid Carter had lent
   them. Carter now began to feel that his plans were indeed maturing well,
   and that he would be able to command the help of these fearsome allies not
   only in quitting this part of dreamland, but in pursuing his ultimate
   quest for the gods atop unknown Kadath, and the marvellous sunset city
   they so strangely withheld from his slumbers. Accordingly he spoke of
   these things to the ghoulish leaders; telling what he knew of the cold
   waste wherein Kadath stands and of the monstrous Shantaks and the
   mountains carven into double-headed images which guard it. He spoke of the
   fear of Shantaks for night-gaunts, and of how the vast hippocephalic birds
   fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that
   divide Inquanok from hateful Leng. He spoke, too, of the things he had
   learned concerning night-gaunts from the frescoes in the windowless
   monastery of the High-Priest Not To Be Described; how even the Great Ones
   fear them, and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep at
   all, but hoary and immemorial Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss.

   All these things Carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls, and presently
   outlined that request which he had in mind and which he did not think
   extravagant considering the services he had so lately rendered the rubbery
   doglike lopers. He wished very much, he said, for the services of enough
   night-gaunts to bear him safely through the aft past the realm of Shantaks
   and carven mountains, and up into the old waste beyond the returning
   tracks of any other mortal. He desired to fly to the onyx castle atop
   unknown Kadath in the cold waste to plead with the Great Ones for the
   sunset city they denied him, and felt sure that the night-gaunts could
   take him thither without trouble; high above the perils of the plain, and
   over the hideous double heads of those carven sentinel mountains that
   squat eternally in the grey dusk. For the horned and faceless creatures
   there could be no danger from aught of earth since the Great Ones
   themselves dread them. And even were unexpected things to come from the
   Other Gods, who are prone to oversee the affairs of earth's milder gods,
   the night-gaunts need not fear; for the outer hells are indifferent
   matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not Nyarlathotep for
   their master, but bow only to potent and archaic Nodens.

   A flock of ten or fifteen night-gaunts, Carter glibbered, would surely be
   enough to keep any combination of Shantaks at a distance, though perhaps
   it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures,
   their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than to men. The
   party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that
   fabulous onyx citadel might have, waiting in the shadows for his return or
   his signal whilst he ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods
   of earth. If any ghouls chose to escort him into the throne-room of the
   Great Ones, he would be thankful, for their presence would add weight and
   importance to his plea. He would not, however, insist upon this but merely
   wished transportation to and from the castle atop unknown Kadath; the
   final journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself, in case
   of gods proved favourable, or back to the earthward Gate of Deeper Slumber
   in the Enchanted Wood in case his prayers were fruitless.

   Whilst Carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention,
   and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds of those
   night-gaunts for which messengers had been sent. The winged steeds settled
   in a semicircle around the ghoulish army, waiting respectfully as the
   doglike chieftains considered the wish of the earthly traveller. The ghoul
   that was Pickman glibbered gravely with his fellows and in the end Carter
   was offered far more than he had at most expected. As he had aided the
   ghouls in their conquest of the moonbeasts, so would they aid him in his
   daring voyage to realms whence none had ever returned; lending him not
   merely a few of their allied night-gaunts, but their entire army as then
   encamped, veteran fighting ghouls and newly assembled night-gaunts alike,
   save only a small garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils
   as had come from the jagged rock in the sea. They would set out through
   the aft whenever he might wish, and once arrived on Kadath a suitable
   train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before
   earth's gods in their onyx castle.

   Moved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words, Carter made plans with
   the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage. The army would fly high,
   they decided, over hideous Leng with its nameless monastery and wicked
   stone villages; stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer with the
   Shantak-frightening night-gaunts whose burrows honeycombed their summits.
   They would then, according to what advice they might receive from those
   denizens, choose their final course; approaching unknown Kadath either
   through the desert of carven mountains north of Inquanok, or through the
   more northerly reaches of repulsive Leng itself. Doglike and soulless as
   they are, the ghouls and night-gaunts had no dread of what those untrodden
   deserts might reveal; nor did they feel any deterring awe at the thought
   of Kadath towering lone with its onyx castle of mystery.

   About midday the ghouls and night-gaunts prepared for flight, each ghoul
   selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him. Carter was placed
   well up toward the head of the column beside Pickman, and in front of the
   whole a double line of riderless night-gaunts was provided as a vanguard.
   At a brisk meep from Pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare
   cloud above the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial
   Sarkomand; higher and higher, till even the great basalt cliff behind the
   town was cleared, and the cold, sterile table-land of Leng's outskirts
   laid open to sight. Still higher flew the black host, till even this
   table-land grew small beneath them; and as they worked northward over the
   wind-swept plateau of horror Carter saw once again with a shudder the
   circle of crude monoliths and the squat windowless building which he knew
   held that frightful silken-masked blasphemy from whose clutches he had so
   narrowly escaped. This time no descent was made as the army swept batlike
   over the sterile landscape, passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome
   stone villages at a great altitude, and pausing not at all to mark the
   morbid twistings of the hooved, horned almost-humans that dance and pipe
   eternally therein. Once they saw a Shantak-bird flying low over the plain,
   but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in
   grotesque panic.

   At dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of
   Inquanok, and hovered about these strange caves near the summits which
   Carter recalled as so frightful to the Shantaks. At the insistent meeping
   of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty burrow a stream
   of horned black flyers with which the ghouls and night-gaunts of the party
   conferred at length by means of ugly gestures. It soon became clear that
   the best course would be that over the cold waste north of Inquanok, for
   Leng's northward reaches are full of unseen pitfalls that even the
   night-gaunts dislike; abysmal influences centering in certain white
   hemispherical buildings on curious knolls, which common folklore
   associates unpleasantly with the Other Gods and their crawling chaos
   Nyarlathotep.

   Of Kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing, save that there
   must be some mighty marvel toward the north, over which the Shantaks and
   the carven mountains stand guard. They hinted at rumoured abnormalities of
   proportion in those trackless leagues beyond, and recalled vague whispers
   of a realm where night broods eternally; but of definite data they had
   nothing to give. So Carter and his party thanked them kindly; and,
   crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies of Inquanok, dropped
   below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the
   distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were mountains till some
   titan hand carved fright into their virgin rock.

   There they squatted in a hellish half-circle, their legs on the desert
   sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds; sinister, wolflike,
   and double-headed, with faces of fury and right hands raised, dully and
   malignly watching the rim of man's world and guarding with horror the
   reaches of a cold northern world that is not man's. From their hideous
   laps rose evil Shantaks of elephantine bulk, but these all fled with
   insane titters as the vanguard of night-gaunts was sighted in the misty
   sky. Northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew, and over
   leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose. Less and less luminous
   grew the clouds, till at length Carter could see only blackness around
   him; but never did the winged steeds falter, bred as they were in earth's
   blackest crypts, and seeing not with any eyes, but with the whole dank
   surface of their slippery forms. On and on they flew, past winds of
   dubious scent and sounds of dubious import; ever in thickest darkness, and
   covering such prodigious spaces that Carter wondered whether or not they
   could still be within earth's dreamland.

   Then suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above. All
   below was still black, but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive
   with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere. It
   was not that the figures of the constellations were different, but that
   the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly
   failed to make plain. Everything focussed toward the north; every curve
   and asterism of the glittering sky became part of a vast design whose
   function was to hurry first the eye and then the whole observer onward to
   some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that
   stretched endlessly ahead. Carter looked toward the east where the great
   ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of Inquanok and
   saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its continued
   presence. It was more broken now, with yawning clefts and fantastically
   erratic pinnacles; and Carter studied closely the suggestive turnings and
   inclinations of that grotesque outline, which seemed to share with the
   stars some subtle northward urge.

   They were flying past at a tremendous speed, so that the watcher had to
   strain hard to catch details; when all at once he beheld just above the
   line of the topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars,
   whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party. The ghouls
   had likewise glimpsed it, for he heard their low glibbering all about him,
   and for a moment he fancied the object was a gigantic Shantak, of a size
   vastly greater than that of the average specimen. Soon, however, he saw
   that this theory would not hold; for the shape of the thing above the
   mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird. Its outline against the
   stars, necessarily vague as it was, resembled rather some huge mitred
   head, or pair of heads infinitely magnified; and its rapid bobbing flight
   through the sky seemed most peculiarly a wingless one. Carter could not
   tell which side of the mountains it was on, but soon perceived that it had
   parts below the parts he had first seen, since it blotted out all the
   stars in places where the ridge was deeply cleft.

   Then came a wide gap in the range, where the hideous reaches of
   transmontane Leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass
   trough which the stars shone wanly. Carter watched this gap with intense
   care, knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond it the
   lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the pinnacles.
   The object had now floated ahead a trifle, and every eye of the party was
   fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in full-length
   silhouette. Gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared the gap,
   slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the
   ghoulish army. For another minute suspense was keen, and then the brief
   instant of full silhouette and revelation came; bringing to the lips of
   the ghouls an awed and half-choked meep of cosmic fear, and to the soul of
   the traveller a chill that never wholly left it. For the mammoth bobbing
   shape that overtopped the ridge was only a head - a mitred double head -
   and below it in terrible vastness loped the frightful swollen body that
   bore it; the mountain-high monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence;
   the hyaena-like distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted
   blackly against the sky, its repulsive pair of cone-capped heads reaching
   half way to the zenith.

   Carter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud, for he was an old
   dreamer; but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he saw that
   there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level of the peaks,
   bobbing along stealthily after the first one. And straight in the rear
   were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full against the southern
   stars, tiptoeing wolflike and lumberingly, their tall mitres nodding
   thousands of feet in the aft. The carven mountains, then, had not stayed
   squatting in that rigid semicircle north of Inquanok, with right hands
   uplifted. They had duties to perform, and were not remiss. But it was
   horrible that they never spoke, and never even made a sound in walking.

   Meanwhile the ghoul that was Pickman had glibbered an order to the
   night-gaunts, and the whole army soared higher into the air. Up toward the
   stars the grotesque column shot, till nothing stood out any longer against
   the sky; neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor the carven
   mitred mountains that walked. All was blackness beneath as the fluttering
   legion surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible laughter in the
   aether, and never a Shantak or less mentionable entity rose from the
   haunted wastes to pursue them. The farther they went, the faster they
   flew, till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of a rifle ball
   and approach that of a planet in its orbit. Carter wondered how with such
   speed the earth could still stretch beneath them, but knew that in the
   land of dream dimensions have strange properties. That they were in a
   realm of eternal night he felt certain, and he fancied that the
   constellations overhead had subtly emphasized their northward focus;
   gathering themselves up as it were to cast the flying army into the void
   of the boreal pole, as the folds of a bag are gathered up to cast out the
   last bits of substance therein.

   Then he noticed with terror that the wings of the night-gaunts were not
   flapping any more. The horned and faceless steeds had folded their
   membranous appendages, and were resting quite passive in the chaos of wind
   that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on. A force not of earth had
   seized on the army, and ghouls and night-gaunts alike were powerless
   before a current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the north whence
   no mortal had ever returned. At length a lone pallid light was seen on the
   skyline ahead, thereafter rising steadily as they approached, and having
   beneath it a black mass that blotted out the stars. Carter saw that it
   must be some beacon on a mountain, for only a mountain could rise so vast
   as seen from so prodigious a height in the air.

   Higher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it, till all
   the northern sky was obscured by the rugged conical mass. Lofty as the
   army was, that pale and sinister beacon rose above it, towering monstrous
   over all peaks and concernments of earth, and tasting the atomless aether
   where the cryptical moon and the mad planets reel. No mountain known of
   man was that which loomed before them. The high clouds far below were but
   a fringe for its foothills. The groping dizziness of topmost air was but a
   girdle for its loins. Scornful and spectral climbed that bridge betwixt
   earth and heaven, black in eternal night, and crowned with a pshent of
   unknown stars whose awful and significant outline grew every moment
   clearer. Ghouls meeped in wonder as they saw it, and Carter shivered in
   fear lest all the hurtling army be dashed to pieces on the unyielding onyx
   of that cyclopean cliff.

   Higher and higher rose the light, till it mingled with the loftiest orbs
   of the zenith and winked down at the flyers with lurid mockery. All the
   north beneath it was blackness now; dread, stony blackness from infinite
   depths to infinite heights, with only that pale winking beacon perched
   unreachably at the top of all vision. Carter studied the light more
   closely, and saw at last what lines its inky background made against the
   stars. There were towers on that titan mountaintop; horrible domed towers
   in noxious and incalculable tiers and clusters beyond any dreamable
   workmanship of man; battlements and terraces of wonder and menace, all
   limned tiny and black and distant against the starry pshent that glowed
   malevolently at the uppermost rim of sight. Capping that most measureless
   of mountains was a castle beyond all mortal thought, and in it glowed the
   daemon-light. Then Randolph Carter knew that his quest was done, and that
   he saw above him the goal of all forbidden steps and audacious visions;
   the fabulous, the incredible home of the Great Ones atop unknown Kadath.

   Even as he realised this thing, Carter noticed a change in the course of
   the helplessly wind-sucked party. They were rising abruptly now, and it
   was plain that the focus of their flight was the onyx castle where the
   pale light shone. So close was the great black mountain that its sides
   sped by them dizzily as they shot upward, and in the darkness they could
   discern nothing upon it. Vaster and vaster loomed the tenebrous towers of
   the nighted castle above, and Carter could see that it was well-nigh
   blasphemous in its immensity. Well might its stones have been quarried by
   nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out of the rock in the hill
   pass north of Inquanok, for such was its size that a man on its threshold
   stood even as air out on the steps of earth's loftiest fortress. The
   pshent of unknown stars above the myriad domed turrets glowed with a
   sallow, sickly flare, so that a kind of twilight hung about the murky
   walls of slippery onyx. The pallid beacon was now seen to be a single
   shining window high up in one of the loftiest towers, and as the helpless
   army neared the top of the mountain Carter thought he detected unpleasant
   shadows flitting across the feebly luminous expanse. It was a strangely
   arched window, of a design wholly alien to earth.

   The solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous
   castle, and it seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated.
   Vast walls shot up, and there was a glimpse of a great gate through which
   the voyagers were swept. All was night in the titan courtyard, and then
   came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched portal
   engulfed the column. Vortices of cold wind surged dankly through sightless
   labyrinths of onyx, and Carter could never tell what Cyclopean stairs and
   corridors lay silent along the route of his endless aerial twisting.
   Always upward led the terrible plunge in darkness, and never a sound,
   touch or glimpse broke the dense pall of mystery. Large as the army of
   ghouls and night-gaunts was, it was lost in the prodigious voids of that
   more than earthly castle. And when at last there suddenly dawned around
   him the lurid light of that single tower room whose lofty window had
   served as a beacon, it took Carter long to discern the far walls and high,
   distant ceiling, and to realize that he was indeed not again in the
   boundless air outside.

   Randolph Carter had hoped to come into the throne-room of the Great Ones
   with poise and dignity, flanked and followed by impressive lines of ghouls
   in ceremonial order, and offering his prayer as a free and potent master
   among dreamers. He had known that the Great Ones themselves are not beyond
   a mortal's power to cope with, and had trusted to luck that the Other Gods
   and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their
   aid at the crucial moment, as they had so often done before when men
   sought out earth's gods in their home or on their mountains. And with his
   hideous escort he had half hoped to defy even the Other Gods if need were,
   knowing as he did that ghouls have no masters, and that night-gaunts own
   not Nyarlathotep but only archaic Nodens for their lord. But now he saw
   that supernal Kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders
   and nameless sentinels, and that the Other Gods are of a surety vigilant
   in guarding the mild, feeble gods of earth. Void as they are of lordship
   over ghouls and night-gaunts, the mindless, shapeless blasphemies of outer
   space can yet control them when they must; so that it was not in state as
   a free and potent master of dreamers that Randolph Carter came into the
   Great Ones' throne-room with his ghouls. Swept and herded by nightmare
   tempests from the stars, and dogged by unseen horrors of the northern
   waste, all that army floated captive and helpless in the lurid light,
   dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by some voiceless order the winds
   of fright dissolved.

   Before no golden dais had Randolph Carter come, nor was there any august
   circle of crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes, long-lobed ears,
   thin nose, and pointed chin whose kinship to the carven face on Ngranek
   might stamp them as those to whom a dreamer might pray. Save for the one
   tower room the onyx castle atop Kadath was dark, and the masters were not
   there. Carter had come to unknown Kadath in the cold waste, but he had not
   found the gods. Yet still the lurid light glowed in that one tower room
   whose size was so little less than that of all outdoors, and whose distant
   walls and roof were so nearly lost to sight in thin, curling mists.
   Earth's gods were not there, it was true, but of subtler and less visible
   presences there could be no lack. Where the mild gods are absent, the
   Other Gods are not unrepresented; and certainly, the onyx castle of
   castles was far from tenantless. In what outrageous form or forms terror
   would next reveal itself Carter could by no means imagine. He felt that
   his visit had been expected, and wondered how close a watch had all along
   been kept upon him by the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. It is Nyarlathotep,
   horror of infinite shapes and dread soul and messenger of the Other Gods,
   that the fungous moonbeasts serve; and Carter thought of the black galley
   that had vanished when the tide of battle turned against the toadlike
   abnormalities on the jagged rock in the sea.

   Reflecting upon these things, he was staggering to his feet in the midst
   of his nightmare company when there rang without warning through that
   pale-litten and limitless chamber the hideous blast of a daemon trumpet.
   Three times pealed that frightful brazen scream, and when the echoes of
   the third blast had died chucklingly away Randolph Carter saw that he was
   alone. Whither, why and how the ghouls and night-gaunts had been snatched
   from sight was not for him to divine. He knew only that he was suddenly
   alone, and that whatever unseen powers lurked mockingly around him were no
   powers of earth's friendly dreamland. Presently from the chamber's
   uttermost reaches a new sound came. This, too, was a rhythmic trumpeting;
   but of a kind far removed from the three raucous blasts which had
   dissolved his goodly cohorts. In this low fanfare echoed all the wonder
   and melody of ethereal dream; exotic vistas of unimagined loveliness
   floating from each strange chord and subtly alien cadence. Odours of
   incense came to match the golden notes; and overhead a great light dawned,
   its colours changing in cycles unknown to earth's spectrum, and following
   the song of the trumpets in weird symphonic harmonies. Torches flared in
   the distance, and the beat of drums throbbed nearer amidst waves of tense
   expectancy.

   Out of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incenses filed twin
   columns of giant black slaves with loin-cloths of iridescent silk. Upon
   their heads were strapped vast helmet-like torches of glittering metal,
   from which the fragrance of obscure balsams spread in fumous spirals. In
   their right hands were crystal wands whose tips were carven into leering
   chimaeras, while their left hands grasped long thin silver trumpets which
   they blew in turn. Armlets and anklets of gold they had, and between each
   pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that held its wearer to a sober
   gait. That they were true black men of earth's dreamland was at once
   apparent, but it seemed less likely that their rites and costumes were
   wholly things of our earth. Ten feet from Carter the columns stopped, and
   as they did so each trumpet flew abruptly to its bearer's thick lips. Wild
   and ecstatic was the blast that followed, and wilder still the cry that
   chorused just after from dark throats somehow made shrill by strange
   artifice.

   Then down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode; a
   tall, slim figure with the young face of an antique Pharaoh, gay with
   prismatic robes and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with inherent
   light. Close up to Carter strode that regal figure; whose proud carriage
   and smart features had in them the fascination of a dark god or fallen
   archangel, and around whose eyes there lurked the languid sparkle of
   capricious humour. It spoke, and in its mellow tones there rippled the
   wild music of Lethean streams.

   "Randolph Carter," said the voice, "you have come to see the Great Ones
   whom it is unlawful for men to see. Watchers have spoken of this thing,
   and the Other Gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly to
   the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void where broods the
   daemon-sultan whose name no lips dare speak aloud.

   "When Barzai the Wise climbed Hatheg-Kia to see the Greater Ones dance and
   howl above the clouds in the moonlight he never returned. The Other Gods
   were there, and they did what was expected. Zenig of Aphorat sought to
   reach unknown Kadath in the cold waste, and his skull is now set in a ring
   on the little finger of one whom I need not name.

   "But you, Randolph Carter, have braved all things of earth's dreamland,
   and burn still with the flame of quest. You came not as one curious, but
   as one seeking his due, nor have you failed ever in reverence toward the
   mild gods of earth. Yet have these gods kept you from the marvellous
   sunset city of your dreams, and wholly through their own small
   covetousness; for verily, they craved the weird loveliness of that which
   your fancy had fashioned, and vowed that henceforward no other spot should
   be their abode.

   "They are gone from their castle on unknown Kadath to dwell in your
   marvellous city. All through its palaces of veined marble they revel by
   day, and when the sun sets they go out in the perfumed gardens and watch
   the golden glory on temples and colonnades, arched bridges and
   silver-basined fountains, and wide streets with blossom-laden urns and
   ivory statues in gleaming rows. And when night comes they climb tall
   terraces in the dew, and sit on carved benches of porphyry scanning the
   stars, or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at the town's steep northward
   slopes, where one by one the little windows in old peaked gables shine
   softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candles.

   "The gods love your marvellous city, and walk no more in the ways of the
   gods. They have forgotten the high places of earth, and the mountains that
   knew their youth. The earth has no longer any gods that are gods, and only
   the Other Ones from outer space hold sway on unremembered Kadath. Far away
   in a valley of your own childhood, Randolph Carter, play the heedless
   Great Ones. You have dreamed too well, O wise arch-dreamer, for you have
   drawn dream's gods away from the world of all men's visions to that which
   is wholly yours; having builded out of your boyhood's small fancies a city
   more lovely than all the phantoms that have gone before.

   "It is not well that earth's gods leave their thrones for the spider to
   spin on, and their realm for the Others to sway in the dark manner of
   Others. Fain would the powers from outside bring chaos and horror to you,
   Randolph Carter, who are the cause of their upsetting, but that they know
   it is by you alone that the gods may be sent back to their world. In that
   half-waking dreamland which is yours, no power of uttermost night may
   pursue; and only you can send the selfish Great Ones gently out of your
   marvellous sunset city, back through the northern twilight to their wonted
   place atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste.

   "So. Randolph Carter, in the name of the Other Gods I spare you and charge
   you to seek that sunset city which is yours, and to send thence the drowsy
   truant gods for whom the dream world waits. Not hard to find is that
   roseal fever of the gods, that fanfare of supernal trumpets and clash of
   immortal cymbals, that mystery whose place and meaning have haunted you
   through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming, and tormented you
   with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things awesome and
   momentous. Not hard to find is that symbol and relic of your days of
   wonder, for truly, it is but the stable and eternal gem wherein all that
   wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening path. Behold! It is not
   over unknown seas but back over well-known years that your quest must go;
   back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched
   glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes.

   "For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of
   what you have seen and loved in youth. It is the glory of Boston's
   hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset, of the
   flower-fragrant Common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of
   gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged Charles
   flows drowsily. These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse
   first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last things
   you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love. And there is antique
   Salem with its brooding years, and spectral Marblehead scaling its rocky
   precipices into past centuries! And the glory of Salem's towers and spires
   seen afar from Marblehead's pastures across the harbour against the
   setting sun.

   "There is Providence quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue
   harbour, with terraces of green leading up to steeples and citadels of
   living antiquity, and Newport climbing wraithlike from its dreaming
   breakwater. Arkham is there, with its moss-grown gambrel roofs and the
   rocky rolling meadows behind it; and antediluvian Kingsport hoary with
   stacked chimneys and deserted quays and overhanging gables, and the marvel
   of high cliffs and the milky-misted ocean with tolling buoys beyond.

   "Cool vales in Concord, cobbled lands in Portsmouth, twilight bends of
   rustic New Hampshire roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse
   walls and creaking well-sweeps. Gloucester's salt wharves and Truro's
   windy willows. Vistas of distant steepled towns and hills beyond hills
   along the North Shore, hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in the
   lee of huge boulders in Rhode Island's back country. Scent of the sea and
   fragrance of the fields; spell of the dark woods and joy of the orchards
   and gardens at dawn. These, Randolph Carter, are your city; for they are
   yourself. New England bore you, and into your soul she poured a liquid
   loveliness which cannot die. This loveliness, moulded, crystallised, and
   polished by years of memory and dreaming, is your terraced wonder of
   elusive sunsets; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and
   carven rail, and descend at last these endless balustraded steps to the
   city of broad squares and prismatic fountains, you need only to turn back
   to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood.

   "Look! through that window shine the stars of eternal night. Even now they
   are shining above the scenes you have known and cherished, drinking of
   their charm that they may shine more lovely over the gardens of dream.
   There is Antares-he is winking at this moment over the roofs of Tremont
   Street, and you could see him from your window on Beacon Hill. Out beyond
   those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my mindless masters have sent me.
   Some day you too may traverse them, but if you are wise you will beware
   such folly; for of those mortals who have been and returned, only one
   preserves a mind unshattered by the pounding, clawing horrors of the void.
   Terrors and blasphemies gnaw at one another for space, and there is more
   evil in the lesser ones than in the greater; even as you know from the
   deeds of those who sought to deliver you into my hands, whilst I myself
   harboured no wish to shatter you, and would indeed have helped you hither
   long ago had I not been elsewhere busy,and certain that you would yourself
   find the way. Shun then, the outer hells, and stick to the calm, lovely
   things of your youth. Seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the
   recreant Great Ones, sending them back gently to those scenes which are of
   their own youth, and which wait uneasy for their return.

   "Easier even then the way of dim memory is the way I will prepare for you.
   See! There comes hither a monstrous Shantak, led by a slave who for your
   peace of mind had best keep invisible. Mount and be ready - there! Yogash
   the Black will help you on the scaly horror. Steer for that brightest star
   just south of the zenith - it is Vega, and in two hours will be just above
   the terrace of your sunset city. Steer for it only till you hear a far-off
   singing in the high aether. Higher than that lurks madness, so rein your
   Shantak when the first note lures. Look then back to earth, and you will
   see shining the deathless altar-flame of Ired-Naa from the sacred roof of
   a temple. That temple is in your desiderate sunset city, so steer for it
   before you heed the singing and are lost.

   "When you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of old
   you scanned the outspread glory, prodding the Shantak till he cry aloud.
   That cry the Great Ones will hear and know as they sit on their perfumed
   terraces, and there will come upon them such a homesickness that all of
   your city's wonders will not console them for the absence of Kadath's grim
   castle and the pshent of eternal stars that crowns it.

   "Then must you land amongst them with the Shantak, and let them see and
   touch that noisome and hippocephalic bird; meanwhile discoursing to them
   of unknown Kadath, which you will so lately have left, and telling them
   how its boundless halls are lovely and unlighted, where of old they used
   to leap and revel in supernal radiance. And the Shantak will talk to them
   in the manner of Shantaks, but it will have no powers of persuasion beyond
   the recalling of elder days.

   "Over and over must you speak to the wandering Great Ones of their home
   and youth, till at last they will weep and ask to be shewn the returning
   path they have forgotten. Thereat can you loose the waiting Shantak,
   sending him skyward with the homing cry of his kind; hearing which the
   Great Ones will prance and jump with antique mirth, and forthwith stride
   after the loathly bird in the fashion of gods, through the deep gulfs of
   heaven to Kadath's familiar towers and domes.

   "Then will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit for
   ever, and once more will earth's gods rule the dreams of men from their
   accustomed seat. Go now - the casement is open and the stars await
   outside. Already your Shantak wheezes and titters with impatience. Steer
   for Vega through the night, but turn when the singing sounds. Forget not
   this warning, lest horrors unthinkable suck you into the gulf of shrieking
   and ululant madness. Remember the Other Gods; they are great and mindless
   and terrible, and lurk in the outer voids. They are good gods to shun.

   "Hei! Aa-shanta 'nygh! You are off! Send back earth's gods to their haunts
   on unknown Kadath, and pray to all space that you may never meet me in my
   thousand other forms. Farewell, Randolph Carter, and beware; for I am
   Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos."

   And Randolph Carter, gasping and dizzy on his hideous Shantak, shot
   screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal Vega; looking
   but once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the onyx
   nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window above
   the air and the clouds of earth's dreamland. Great polypous horrors slid
   darkly past, and unseen bat wings beat multitudinous around him, but still
   he clung to the unwholesome mane of that loathly and hippocephalic scaled
   bird. The stars danced mockingly, almost shifting now and then to form
   pale signs of doom that one might wonder one had not seen and feared
   before; and ever the winds of nether howled of vague blackness and
   loneliness beyond the cosmos.

   Then through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent, and
   all the winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away before the
   dawn. Trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made weirdly visible,
   there rose a timid hint of far-off melody, droning in faint chords that
   our own universe of stars knows not. And as that music grew, the Shantak
   raised its ears and plunged ahead, and Carter likewise bent to catch each
   lovely strain. It was a song, but not the song of any voice. Night and the
   spheres sang it, and it was old when space and Nyarlathotep and the Other
   Gods were born.

   Faster flew the Shantak, and lower bent the rider, drunk with the marvel
   of strange gulfs, and whirling in the crystal coils of outer magic. Then
   came too late the warning of the evil one, the sardonic caution of the
   daemon legate who had bidden the seeker beware the madness of that song.
   Only to taunt had Nyarlathotep marked out the way to safety and the
   marvellous sunset city; only to mock had that black messenger revealed the
   secret of these truant gods whose steps he could so easily lead back at
   will. For madness and the void's wild vengeance are Nyarlathotep's only
   gifts to the presumptuous; and frantick though the rider strove to turn
   his disgusting steed, that leering, tittering Shantak coursed on impetuous
   and relentless, flapping its great slippery wings in malignant joy and
   headed for those unhallowed pits whither no dreams reach; that last
   amorphous blight of nether-most confusion where bubbles and blasphemes at
   infinity's centre the mindless daemon-sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips
   dare speak aloud.

   Unswerving and obedient to the foul legate's orders, that hellish bird
   plunged onward through shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in
   darkness, and vacuous herds of drifting entities that pawed and groped and
   groped and pawed; the nameless larvae of the Other Gods, that are like
   them blind and without mind, and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts

   Onward unswerving and relentless, and tittering hilariously to watch the
   chuckling and hysterics into which the risen song of night and the spheres
   had turned, that eldritch scaly monster bore its helpless rider; hurtling
   and shooting, cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning the outermost
   abysses; leaving behind the stars and the realms of matter, and darting
   meteor-like through stark formlessness toward those inconceivable,
   unlighted chambers beyond time wherein Azathoth gnaws shapeless and
   ravenous amidst the muffled, maddening beat of vile drums and the thin,
   monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

   Onward - onward - through the screaming, cackling, and blackly populous
   gulfs - and then from some dim blessed distance there came an image and a
   thought to Randolph Carter the doomed. Too well had Nyarlathotep planned
   his mocking and his tantalising, for he had brought up that which no gusts
   of icy terror could quite efface. Home - New England - Beacon Hill - the
   waking world.

   "For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of
   what you have seen and loved in youth... the glory of Boston's hillside
   roofs and western windows aflame with sunset; of the flower-fragrant
   Common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and
   chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged Charles flows
   drowsily... this loveliness, moulded, crystallised, and polished by years
   of memory and dreaming, is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets; and to
   find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail, and descend at
   last those endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and
   prismatic fountains, you need only to turn back to the thoughts and
   visions of your wistful boyhood."

   Onward - onward - dizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness
   where sightless feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless things
   tittered and tittered and tittered. But the image and the thought had
   come, and Randolph Carter knew clearly that he was dreaming and only
   dreaming, and that somewhere in the background the world of waking and the
   city of his infancy still lay. Words came again - "You need only turn back
   to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood." Turn - turn -
   blackness on every side, but Randolph Carter could turn.

   Thick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses, Randolph
   Carter could turn and move. He could move, and if he chose he could leap
   off the evil Shantak that bore him hurtlingly doomward at the orders of
   Nyarlathotep. He could leap off and dare those depths of night that yawned
   interminably down, those depths of fear whose terrors yet could not exceed
   the nameless doom that lurked waiting at chaos' core. He could turn and
   move and leap - he could - he would - he would - he would.

   Off that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate
   dreamer, and down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell.
   Aeons reeled, universes died and were born again, stars became nebulae and
   nebulae became stars, and still Randolph Carter fell through those endless
   voids of sentient blackness.

   Then in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the
   cosmos churned itself into another futile completion, and all things
   became again as they were unreckoned kalpas before. Matter and light were
   born anew as space once had known them; and comets, suns and worlds sprang
   flaming into life, though nothing survived to tell that they had been and
   gone, been and gone, always and always, back to no first beginning.

   And there was a firmament again, and a wind, and a glare of purple light
   in the eyes of the falling dreamer. There were gods and presences and
   wills; beauty and evil, and the shrieking of noxious night robbed of its
   prey. For through the unknown ultimate cycle had lived a thought and a
   vision of a dreamer's boyhood, and now there were remade a waking world
   and an old cherished city to body and to justify these things. Out of the
   void S'ngac the violet gas had pointed the way, and archaic Nodens was
   bellowing his guidance from unhinted deeps.

   Stars swelled to dawns, and dawns burst into fountains of gold, carmine,
   and purple, and still the dreamer fell. Cries rent the aether as ribbons
   of light beat back the fiends from outside. And hoary Nodens raised a howl
   of triumph when Nyarlathotep, close on his quarry, stopped baffled by a
   glare that seared his formless hunting-horrors to grey dust. Randolph
   Carter had indeed descended at last the wide marmoreal flights to his
   marvellous city, for he was come again to the fair New England world that
   had wrought him.

   So to the organ chords of morning's myriad whistles, and dawn's blaze
   thrown dazzling through purple panes by the great gold dome of the State
   House on the hill, Randolph Carter leaped shoutingly awake within his
   Boston room. Birds sang in hidden gardens and the perfume of trellised
   vines came wistful from arbours his grandfather had reared. Beauty and
   light glowed from classic mantel and carven cornice and walls grotesquely
   figured, while a sleek black cat rose yawning from hearthside sleep that
   his master's start and shriek had disturbed. And vast infinities away,
   past the Gate of Deeper Slumber and the enchanted wood and the garden
   lands and the Cerenarian Sea and the twilight reaches of Inquanok, the
