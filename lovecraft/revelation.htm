				<p>In a vale of light and laughter,
				<br>Shining 'neath the friendly sun,
				<br>Where fulfilment follow'd after
				<br>Ev'ry hope or dream begun;
				<br>Where an Aidenn gay and glorious,
				<br>Beckon'd down the winsome way;
				<br>There my soul, o'er pain victorious,
				<br>Laugh'd and lingered - yesterday.
				<p>Green and narrow was my valley,
				<br>Temper'd with a verdant shade;
				<br>Sun deck'd brooklets musically
				<br>Sparkled thro' each glorious glade;
				<br>And at night the stars serenely
				<br>Glow'd betwixt the boughs o'erhead,
				<br>While Astarte, calm and queenly,
				<br>Floods of fairy radiance shed.
				<p>There amid the tinted bowers,
				<br>Raptur'd with the opiate spell
				<br>Of the grasses, ferns and flowers,
				<br>Poppy, Phlox and Pimpernel,
				<br>Long I lay, entranc'd and dreaming,
				<br>Pleas'd with Nature's bounteous store,
				<br>Till I mark'd the shaded gleaming
				<br>Of the sky, and yearn'd for more.
				<p>Eagerly the branches tearing,
				<br>Clear'd I all the space above,
				<br>Till the bolder gaze, high faring,
				<br>Scann'd the naked skies of Jove;
				<br>Deeps unguess'd now shone before me,
				<br>Splendid beam'd the solar car;
				<br>Wings of fervid fancy bore me
				<br>Out beyond the farthest star.
				<p>Reaching, gasping, wishing, longing
				<br>For the pageant brought to sight,
				<br>Vain I watch'd the gold orbs thronging
				<br>Round the celestial poles of light.
				<br>Madly on a moonbeam ladder
				<br>Heav'ns abyss I sought to scale,
				<br>Ever wiser, ever sadder,
				<br>As the fruitless task would fail.
				<p>Then, with futile striving sated,
				<br>Veer'd my soul to earth again,
				<br>Well content that I was fated
				<br>For a fair, yet low domain;
				<br>Pleasing thoughts of glad tomorrows,
				<br>Like the blissful moments past,
				<br>Lull'd to rest my transient sorrows,
				<br>Stil'd my godless greed at last.
				<p>But my downward glance, returning,
				<br>Shrank in fright from what it spy'd;
				<br>Slopes in hideous torment burning,
				<br>Terror in the brooklet's tide:
				<br>For the dell, of shade denuded
				<br>By my desecrating hand,
				<br>'Neath the bare sky blaz'd and brooded
				<br>As a lost, accursed land.
