				<h4 align="center">A Fable</h4>
				<p align="center"><i>Luxus tumultus semper causa est.</i>
				<p>Lucullus Languish, student of the skies,
				<br>And connoisseur of rarebits and mince pies,
				<br>A bard by choice, a grocer's clerk by trade,
				<br>(Grown pessimist through honours long delay'd)
				<br>A secret yearning bore, that he might shine
				<br>In breathing numbers, and in song divine.
				<br>Each day his fountain pen was wont to drop
				<br>An ode or dirge or two about the shop,
				<br>Yet naught could strike the chord within his heart
				<br>That throbb'd for poesy, and cry'd for art.
				<br>Each eve he sought his bashful Muse to wake
				<br>With overdoses of ice cream and cake,
				<br>But though th'ambitious youth a dreamer grew,
				<br>Th' Aonian Nymph delcin'd to come to view.
				<p>Something at dusk he scour'd the heav'ns afar
				<br>Searching for raptures in the evening star;
				<br>One night he strove to catch a tale untold
				<br>In crystal deeps - but only caught a cold.
				<br>So pin'd Lucullus with his lofty woe,
				<br>Till one drear day he bought a set of Poe:
				<br>Charm'd with the cheerful horrors there display's,
				<br>He vow'd with gloom to woo the Heav'nly Maid.
				<br>Of Auber's Tarn and Yaanek's slope he dreams,
				<br>And weaves an hundred Ravens in his schemes.
				<br>Not far from our young hero's peaceful home,
				<br>Lies the fair grove wherein he loves to roam.
				<br>Though but a stunted copse in vacant lot,
				<br>He dubs it Temp-e, and adores the spot;
				<br>When shallow puddles dot the wooded plain,
				<br>And brim o'er muddy banks with muddy rain,
				<br>He calls them limpid lakes or poison pools,
				<br>(Depending on which bard his fancy rules.)
				<br>'Tis here he comes with Heliconian fire
				<br>On Sundays when he smites the Attic lyre;
				<br>And here one afternoon he brought his gloom,
				<br>Resolv'd to chant a poet's lay of doom.
				<br>Roget's Thesaurus, and a book of rhymes,
				<br>Provide the rungs whereon his spirit climbs:
				<br>With this grave retinue he trod the grove
				<br>And pray'd the Fauns he might a Poe-et prove.
				<br>But sad to tell, ere Pegasus flew high,
				<br>The not unrelish'd supper hour drew nigh;
				<br>Our tuneful swain th'imperious call attends,
				<br>And soon above the groaning table bends.
				<br>Though it were too prosaic to relate
				<br>Th' exact particulars of what he ate,
				<br>(Such long-drawn lists the hasty reader skips,
				<br>Like Homer's well-known catalogue of ships)
				<br>This much we swear: that as adjournment near'd,
				<br>A monstrous lot of cake had disappear'd!
				<br>Soon to his chamber the young bard repairs,
				<br>And courts soft Somnus with sweet Lydian airs;
				<br>Through open casement scans the star-strown deep,
				<br>And 'neath Orion's beams sinks off to sleep.
				<p>Now start from airy dell the elfin train
				<br>That dance each midnight o'er the sleeping plain,
				<br>To bless the just, or cast a warning spell
				<br>On those who dine not wisely, but too well.
				<br>First Deacon Smith they plague, whose nasal glow
				<br>Comes from what Holmes hath call'd "Elixir Pro";
				<br>Group'd round the couch his visage they deride,
				<br>Whilst through his dreams unnumber'd serpents glide.
				<br>Next troop the little folk into the room
				<br>Where snore our young Endymion, swath'd in gloom:
				<br>A smile lights up his boyish face, whilst he
				<br>Dreams of the moon - or what he ate at tea.
				<br>The chieftain elf th' unconscious youth surveys,
				<br>and on his form a strange enchantment lays:
				<br>Those lips, that lately trill'd with frosted cake,
				<br>Uneasy sounds in slumbrous fashion make;
				<br>At length their owner's fancies they rehearse,
				<br>And lisp this awesome Poe-em in blank verse:

				<h4 align="center">Aletheia Phrikodes</h4>
				<p align="center"><i>Omnia risus et omnia pulvis et omnia nihil.</i>
				<p>Demoniac clouds, up-pil'd in chasmy reach
				<br>Of soundless heav'n, smother'd the brooding night;
				<br>Nor came the wonted whisp'rings of the swamp,
				<br>Nor voice of autumn wind along the moor,
				<br>Nor mutter'd noises of th' insomnious grove
				<br>Whose black recesses never saw the sun.
				<br>Within that grove a hideous hollow lies,
				<br>Half bare of trees; a pool in centre lurks
				<br>That none dares sound; a tarn of murky face,
				<br>(Though naught can prove its hue, since light of day,
				<br>Affrighted, shuns the forest-shadow's banks.)
				<br>Hard by, a yawning hillside grotto breathes
				<br>From deeps unvisited, a dull, dank air
				<br>That sears the leaves on certain stunted trees
				<br>Which stand about, clawing the spectral gloom
				<br>With evil boughs.  To this accursed dell
				<br>Come woodland creatures, seldom to depart:
				<br>Once I behold, upon a crumbling stone
				<br>Set altar-like before the cave, a thing
				<br>I saw not clearly, yet from glimpsing, fled.
				<br>In this half-dusk I meditate alone
				<br>At many a weary noontide, when without
				<br>A world forgets me in its sun-blest mirth.
				<br>Here howls by night the werewolves, and the souls
				<br>Of those that knew me well in other days.
				<br>Yet on this night the grove spake not to me;
				<br>Nor spake the swamp, nor wind along the moor
				<br>Nor moan'd the wind about the lonely eaves
				<br>Of the bleak, haunted pile wherein I lay.
				<br>I was afraid to sleep, or quench the spark
				<br>Of the low-burning taper by my couch.
				<br>I was afraid when through the vaulted space
				<br>Of the old tow'r, the clock-ticks died away
				<br>Into a silence so profound and chill
				<br>That my teeth chatter'd - giving yet no sound.
				<br>Then flicker'd low the light, and all dissolv'd
				<br>Leaving me floating in the hellish grasp
				<br>Of body'd blackness, from whose beating wings
				<br>Came ghoulish blasts of charnel-scented mist.
				<br>things vague, unseen, unfashion'd, and unnam'd
				<br>Jostled each other in the seething void
				<br>That gap'd, chaotic, downward to a sea
				<br>Of speechless horror, foul with writhing thoughts.
				<br>All this I felt, and felt the mocking eyes
				<br>Of the curs's universe upon my soul;
				<br>Yet naught I saw nor heard, till flash'd a beam
				<br>Of lurid lustre through the rotting heav'ns,
				<br>Playing on scenes I labour'd not to see.
				<br>Methought the nameless tarn, alight at last,
				<br>Reflected shapes, and more reveal'd within
				<br>Those shocking depths that ne'er were seen before;
				<br>Methought from out the cave a demon train,
				<br>Grinning and smirking, reel'd in fiendish rout;
				<br>Bearing within their reeking paws a load
				<br>Of carrion viands for an impious feast.
				<br>Methought the stunted trees with hungry arms
				<br>Grop'd greedily for things I dare not name;
				<br>The while a stifling, wraith-like noisomeness
				<br>Fill'd all the dale, and spoke a larger life
				<br>Of uncorporeal hideousness awake
				<br>In the half-sentient wholeness of the spot.
				<br>Now glow'd the ground, and tarn, and cave, and trees,
				<br>And moving forms, and things not spoken of,
				<br>With such a phosphorescence as men glimpse
				<br>In the putrescent thickets of the swamp
				<br>Where logs decaying lie, and rankness reigns.
				<br>Methought a fire-mist drap'd with lucent fold
				<br>The well-remember'd features of the grove,
				<br>Whilst whirling ether bore in eddying streams
				<br>The hot, unfinish'd stuff of nascent worlds
				<br>Hither and thither through infinity
				<br>Of light and darkness, strangely intermix'd;
				<br>Wherein all entity had consciousness,
				<br>Without th' accustom'd outward shape of life.
				<br>Of these swift circling currents was my soul,
				<br>Free from the flesh, a true constituent part;
				<br>Nor felt I less myself, for want of form.
				<br>Then clear'd the mist, and o'er a star-strown scene
				<br>Divine and measureless, I gaz'd in awe.
				<br>Alone in space, I view'd a feeble fleck
				<br>Of silvern light, marking the narrow ken
				<br>Which mortals call the boundless universe.
				<br>On ev'ry side, each as a tiny star,
				<br>Shone more creations, vaster than our own,
				<br>And teeming with unnumber'd forms of life;
				<br>Though we as life would recognize it not,
				<br>Being bound to earthy thoughts of human mould.
				<br>As on a moonless night the Milky Way
				<br>In solid sheen displays its countless orbs
				<br>To weak terrestrial eyes, each orb a sun;
				<br>So beam'd the prospect on my wond'ring soul;
				<br>A spangled curtain, rich with twinkling gems,
				<br>Yet each a mighty universe of suns.
				<br>But as I gaz'd, I sens'd a spirit voice
				<br>In speech didactic, though no voice it was,
				<br>Save as it carried thought.  It bade me mark
				<br>That all the universes in my view
				<br>Form'd but an atom in infinity;
				<br>Whose reaches pass the ether-laden realms
				<br>Of heat and light, extending to far fields
				<br>Where flourish worlds invisible and vague,
				<br>Fill'd with strange wisdom and uncanny life,
				<br>And yet beyond; to myriad spheres of light,
				<br>To spheres of darkness, to abysmal voids
				<br>That know the pulses of disorder'd force.
				<br>Big with these musings, I survey'd the surge
				<br>Of boundless being, yet I us'd not eyes,
				<br>For spirit leans not on the props of sense.
				<br>The docent presence swell'd my strength of soul;
				<br>All things I knew, but knew with mind alone.
				<br>Time's endless vista spread before my thought
				<br>With its vast pageant of unceasing change
				<br>And sempiternal strife of force and will;
				<br>I saw the ages flow in stately stream
				<br>Past rise and fall of universe and life;
				<br>I saw the birth of suns and worlds, their death,
				<br>Their transmutation into limpid flame,
				<br>Their second birth and second death, their course
				<br>Perpetual through the aeons' termless flight,
				<br>Never the same, yet born again to serve
				<br>The varying purpose of omnipotence.
				<br>And whilst I watch'd, I knew each second's space
				<br>Was greater than the lifetime of our world.
				<br>Then turn'd my musings to that speck of dust
				<br>Whereon my form corporeal took its rise;
				<br>That speck, born but a second, which must die
				<br>In one brief second more; that fragile earth;
				<br>That crude experiment; that cosmic sport
				<br>Which holds our proud, aspiring race of mites
				<br>And moral vermin; those presuming mites
				<br>Whom ignorance with empty pomp adorns,
				<br>And misinstructs in specious dignity;
				<br>Those mites who, reas'ning outward, vaunt themselves
				<br>As the chief work of Nature, and enjoy
				<br>In fatuous fancy the particular care
				<br>Of all her mystic, super-regnant pow'r.
				<br>And as I strove to vision the sad sphere
				<br>Which lurk'd, lost in ethereal vortices;
				<br>Methough my soul, tun'd to the infinite,
				<br>Refus'd to glimpse that poor atomic blight;
				<br>That misbegotten accident of space;
				<br>That globe of insignificance, whereon
				<br>(My guide celestial told me) dwells no part
				<br>Of empyreal virtue, but where breed
				<br>The coarse corruptions of divine disease;
				<br>The fest'ring ailments of infinity;
				<br>The morbid matter by itself call'd man:
				<br>Such matter (said my guide) as oft breaks forth
				<br>On broad Creation's fabric, to annoy
				<br>For a brief instant, ere assuaging death
				<br>Heal up the malady its birth provok'd.
				<br>Sicken'd, I turn'd my heavy thoughts away.
				<br>Then spake th' ethereal guide with mocking mien,
				<br>Upbraiding me for searching after Truth;
				<br>Visiting on my mind the searing scorn
				<br>Of mind superior; laughing at the woe
				<br>Which rent the vital essence of my soul.
				<br>Methought he brought remembrance of the time
				<br>When from my fellows to the grove I stray'd,
				<br>In solitude and dusk to meditate
				<br>On things forbidden, and to pierce the veil
				<br>Of seeming good and seeming beauteousness
				<br>That covers o'er the tragedy of Truth,
				<br>Helping mankind forget his sorry lot,
				<br>And raising Hope where Truth would crush it down.
				<br>He spake, and as he ceas'd, methought the flames
				<br>Of fuming Heav'n revolv'd in torments dire;
				<br>Whirling in maelstroms of revellious might,
				<br>Yet ever bound by laws I fathom'd not.
				<br>Cycles and epicycles of such girth
				<br>That each a cosmos seem'd, dazzled my gaze
				<br>Till all a wild phantasmal flow became.
				<br>Now burst athwart the fulgent formlessness
				<br>A rift of purer sheen, a sight supernal,
				<br>Broader that all the void conceiv'd by man,
				<br>Yet narrow here.  A glimpse of heav'ns beyond;
				<br>Of weird creations so remote and great
				<br>That ev'n my guide assum'd a tone of awe.
				<br>Borne on the wings of stark immensity,
				<br>A touch of rhythm celestial reach'd my soul;
				<br>Thrilling me more with horror than with joy.
				<br>Again the spirit mock'd my human pangs,
				<br>And deep revil'd me for presumptuous thoughts;
				<br>Yet changing now his mien, he bade me scan
				<br>The wid'ning rift that clave the walls of space;
				<br>He bade me search it for the ultimate;
				<br>He bade me find the truth I sought so long;
				<br>He bade me brave th' unutterable Thing,
				<br>The final Truth of moving entity.
				<br>All this he bade and offer'd - but my soul,
				<br>Clinging to life, fled without aim or knowledge,
				<br>Shrieking in silence through the gibbering deeps.

				<h4 align="center">* * * * * *</h4>
				<p>Thus shriek'd the young Lucullus, as he fled
				<br>Through gibbering deeps - and tumbled out of bed;
				<br>Within the room the morning sunshine gleams,
				<br>Whilst the poor youth recalls his troubled dreams.
				<br>He feels his aching limbs, whose woeful pain
				<br>Informs his soul his body lives again,
				<br>And thanks his stars - or cosmoses - or such -
				<br>That he survives the noxious nightmare's clutch.
				<br>Thrill'd with the music of th' eternal spheres,
				<br>(Or is it the alarm-clock that he hears?)
				<br>He vows to all the Pantheon, high and low,
				<br>No more to feed on cake, or pie, or Poe.
				<br>And now his gloomy spirits seem to rise,
				<br>As he the world beholds with clearer eyes;
				<br>The cup he thought too full of dregs to quaff,
				<br>Affords him wine enough to raise a laugh.
				<br>(All this is metaphor - you must not think
				<br>Our late Endymion prone to stronger drink!)
				<br>With brighter visage and with lighter heart,
				<br>He turns his fancies to the grocer's mart;
				<br>And strange to say, at last he seems to find
				<br>His daily duties worthy of his mind.
				<br>Since Truth prov'd such a high and dang'rous goal,
				<br>Our bard seeks one less trying to his soul;
				<br>With deep-drawn breath he flouts his dreary woes,
				<br>And a good clerk from a bad poet grows!
				<br>Now close attend my lay, ye scribbling crew
				<br>That bay the moon in numbers strange and new;
				<br>That madly for the spark celestial bawl
				<br>In metres short or long, or none at all;
				<br>Curb your rash force, in numbers or at tea,
				<br>Nor over-zealous for high fancies be;
				<br>Reflect, ere ye the draught Pierian take,
				<br>What worthy clerks or plumbers ye might make;
				<br>Wax not too frenzied in the leaping line
				<br>That neither sense nor measure can confine,
				<br>Lest ye, like young Lucullus Launguish, groan
				<br>Beneath Poe-etic nightmares of your own!
