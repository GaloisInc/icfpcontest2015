	<p>I noiticed on your website you have some works by C.M. Eddy, Jr. <i>The Loved Dead</i>, <i>The Ghosteater</i>, <i>Ashes</i>, and <i>Deaf, Dumb, and Blind</i>. These stories were written by my grandfather. These stories are not in the public domain, my grandfather retained the rights to them after they were published in Weird Tales. Upon my grandfathers death in 1967 and grandmothers death in 1978 the rights were inherited by my mother and aunt. I am writing this on their behalf.  I would ask that you honor this under the copyright law. If you have any questions feel free to get in touch with me. Thank you.
