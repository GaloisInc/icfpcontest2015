                 There is snow on the ground,                   
                   And the valleys are cold,                    
                 And a midnight profound                        
                  Blackly squats o'er the wold;                 
                 But a light on the hilltops half-seen hints of 
                   feastings unhallowed and old.                
                                                                
                 There is death in the clouds,                  
                   There is fear in the night,                  
                 For the dead in their shrouds                  
                   Hail the sun's turning flight.               
                 And chant wild in the woods as they dance      
                   round a Yule-altar fungous and white.        
                                                                
                 To no gale of Earth's kind                     
                   Sways the forest of oak,                     
                 Where the thick boughs entwined                
                   By mad mistletoes choke,                     
                 For these pow'rs are the pow'rs of the dark,   
                   from the graves of the lost Druid-folk.      
                                                                
                 And mayst thou to such deeds                   
                   Be an abbot and priest,                      
                 Singing cannibal greeds                        
                   At each devil-wrought feast,                 
                 And to all the incredulous world               
                   shewing dimly the sign of the beast.
