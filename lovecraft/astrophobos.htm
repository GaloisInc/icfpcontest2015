				<p>In the Midnight heaven's burning
				<br>Through the ethereal deeps afar
				<br>Once I watch'd with restless yearning
				<br>An alluring aureate star;
				<br>Ev'ry eve aloft returning
				<br>Gleaming nigh the Arctic Car.
				<p>Mystic waves of beauty blended
				<br>With the gorgeous golden rays
				<br>Phantasies of bliss descended
				<br>In a myrrh'd Elysian haze.
				<br>In the lyre-born chords extended
				<br>Harmonies of Lydian lays.
				<p>And (thought I) lies scenes of pleasure,
				<br>Where the free and blessed dwell,
				<br>And each moment bears a treasure,
				<br>Freighted with the lotos-spell,
				<br>And there floats a liquid measure
				<br>From the lute of Israfel.
				<p>There (I told myself) were shining
				<br>Worlds of happiness unknown,
				<br>Peace and Innocence entwining
				<br>By the Crowned Virtue's throne;
				<br>Men of light, their thoughts refining
				<br>Purer, fairer, than my own.
				<p>Thus I mus'd when o'er the vision
				<br>Crept a red delirious change;
				<br>Hope dissolving to derision,
				<br>Beauty to distortion strange;
				<br>Hymnic chords in weird collision,
				<br>Spectral sights in endless range....
				<br>Crimson burn'd the star of madness
				<br>As behind the beams I peer'd;
				<br>All was woe that seem'd but gladness
				<br>Ere my gaze with Truth was sear'd;
				<br>Cacodaemons, mir'd with madness,
				<br>Through the fever'd flick'ring leer'd....
				<br>Now I know the fiendish fable
				<br>The the golden glitter bore;
				<br>Now I shun the spangled sable
				<br>That I watch'd and lov'd before;
				<br>But the horror, set and stable,
				<br>Haunts my soul forevermore!
