   On 16 July 1923, I moved into Exham Priory after the last workman had
   finished his labours. The restoration had been a stupendous task, for
   little had remained of the deserted pile but a shell-like ruin; yet
   because it had been the seat of my ancestors, I let no expense deter me.
   The place had not been inhabited since the reign of James the First, when
   a tragedy of intensely hideous, though largely unexplained, nature had
   struck down the master, five of his children, and several servants; and
   driven forth under a cloud of suspicion and terror the third son, my
   lineal progenitor and the only survivor of the abhorred line.

   With this sole heir denounced as a murderer, the estate had reverted to
   the crown, nor had the accused man made any attempt to exculpate himself
   or regain his property. Shaken by some horror greater than that of
   conscience or the law, and expressing only a frantic wish to exclude the
   ancient edifice from his sight and memory, Walter de la Poer, eleventh
   Baron Exham, fled to Virginia and there founded the family which by the
   next century had become known as Delapore.

   Exham Priory had remained untenanted, though later allotted to the estates
   of the Norrys family and much studied because of its peculiarly composite
   architecture; an architecture involving Gothic towers resting on a Saxon
   or Romanesque substructure, whose foundation in turn was of a still
   earlier order or blend of orders -- Roman, and even Druidic or native
   Cymric, if legends speak truly. This foundation was a very singular thing,
   being merged on one side with the solid limestone of the precipice from
   whose brink the priory overlooked a desolate valley three miles west of
   the village of Anchester.

   Architects and antiquarians loved to examine this strange relic of
   forgotten centuries, but the country folk hated it. They had hated it
   hundreds of years before, when my ancestors lived there, and they hated it
   now, with the moss and mould of abandonment on it. I had not been a day in
   Anchester before I knew I came of an accursed house. And this week workmen
   have blown up Exham Priory, and are busy obliterating the traces of its
   foundations. The bare statistics of my ancestry I had always known,
   together with the fact that my first American forebear had come to the
   colonies under a strange cloud. Of details, however, I had been kept
   wholly ignorant through the policy of reticence always maintained by the
   Delapores. Unlike our planter neighbours, we seldom boasted of crusading
   ancestors or other mediaeval and Renaissance heroes; nor was any kind of
   tradition handed down except what may have been recorded in the sealed
   envelope left before the Civil War by every squire to his eldest son for
   posthumous opening. The glories we cherished were those achieved since the
   migration; the glories of a proud and honourable, if somewhat reserved and
   unsocial Virginia line.

   During the war our fortunes were extinguished and our whole existence
   changed by the burning of Carfax, our home on the banks of the James. My
   grandfather, advanced in years, had perished in that incendiary outrage,
   and with him the envelope that had bound us all to the past. I can recall
   that fire today as I saw it then at the age of seven, with the federal
   soldiers shouting, the women screaming, and the negroes howling and
   praying. My father was in the army, defending Richmond, and after many
   formalities my mother and I were passed through the lines to join him.

   When the war ended we all moved north, whence my mother had come; and I
   grew to manhood, middle age, and ultimate wealth as a stolid Yankee.
   Neither my father nor I ever knew what our hereditary envelope had
   contained, and as I merged into the greyness of Massachusetts business
   life I lost all interest in the mysteries which evidently lurked far back
   in my family tree. Had I suspected their nature, how gladly I would have
   left Exham Priory to its moss, bats and cobwebs!

   My father died in 1904, but without any message to leave to me, or to my
   only child, Alfred, a motherless boy of ten. It was this boy who reversed
   the order of family information, for although I could give him only
   jesting conjectures about the past, he wrote me of some very interesting
   ancestral legends when the late war took him to England in 1917 as an
   aviation officer. Apparently the Delapores had a colourful and perhaps
   sinister history, for a friend of my son's, Capt. Edward Norrys of the
   Royal Flying Corps, dwelt near the family seat at Anchester and related
   some peasant superstitions which few novelists could equal for wildness
   and incredibility. Norrys himself, of course, did not take them so
   seriously; but they amused my son and made good material for his letters
   to me. It was this legendry which definitely turned my attention to my
   transatlantic heritage, and made me resolve to purchase and restore the
   family seat which Norrys showed to Alfred in its picturesque desertion,
   and offered to get for him at a surprisingly reasonable figure, since his
   own uncle was the present owner.

   I bought Exham Priory in 1918, but was almost immediately distracted from
   my plans of restoration by the return of my son as a maimed invalid.
   During the two years that he lived I thought of nothing but his care,
   having even placed my business under the direction of partners.

   In 1921, as I found myself bereaved and aimless, a retired manufacturer no
   longer young, I resolved to divert my remaining years with my new
   possession. Visiting Anchester in December, I was entertained by Capt.
   Norrys, a plump, amiable young man who had thought much of my son, and
   secured his assistance in gathering plans and anecdotes to guide in the
   coming restoration. Exham Priory itself I saw without emotion, a jumble of
   tottering mediaeval ruins covered with lichens and honeycombed with rooks'
   nests, perched perilously upon a precipice, and denuded of floors or other
   interior features save the stone walls of the separate towers.

   As I gradually recovered the image of the edifice as it had been when my
   ancestors left it over three centuries before, I began to hire workmen for
   the reconstruction. In every case I was forced to go outside the immediate
   locality, for the Anchester villagers had an almost unbelievable fear and
   hatred of the place. The sentiment was so great that it was sometimes
   communicated to the outside labourers, causing numerous desertions; whilst
   its scope appeared to include both the priory and its ancient family.

   My son had told me that he was somewhat avoided during his visits because
   he was a de la Poer, and I now found myself subtly ostracized for a like
   reason until I convinced the peasants how little I knew of my heritage.
   Even then they sullenly disliked me, so that I had to collect most of the
   village traditions through the mediation of Norrys. What the people could
   not forgive, perhaps, was that I had come to restore a symbol so abhorrent
   to them; for, rationally or not, they viewed Exham Priory as nothing less
   than a haunt of fiends and werewolves.

   Piecing together the tales which Norrys collected for me, and
   supplementing them with the accounts of several savants who had studied
   the ruins, I deduced that Exham Priory stood on the site of a prehistoric
   temple; a Druidical or ante-Druidical thing which must have been
   contemporary with Stonehenge. That indescribable rites had been celebrated
   there, few doubted, and there were unpleasant tales of the transference of
   these rites into the Cybele worship which the Romans had introduced.

   Inscriptions still visible in the sub-cellar bore such unmistakable
   letters as 'DIV... OPS ... MAGNA. MAT...', sign of the Magna Mater whose
   dark worship was once vainly forbidden to Roman citizens. Anchester had
   been the camp of the third Augustan legion, as many remains attest, and it
   was said that the temple of Cybele was splendid and thronged with
   worshippers who performed nameless ceremonies at the bidding of a Phrygian
   priest. Tales added that the fall of the old religion did not end the
   orgies at the temple, but that the priests lived on in the new faith
   without real change. Likewise was it said that the rites did not vanish
   with the Roman power, and that certain among the Saxons added to what
   remained of the temple, and gave it the essential outline it subsequently
   preserved, making it the centre of a cult feared through half the
   heptarchy. About 1000 A.D. the place is mentioned in a chronicle as being
   a substantial stone priory housing a strange and powerful monastic order
   and surrounded by extensive gardens which needed no walls to exclude a
   frightened populace. It was never destroyed by the Danes, though after the
   Norman Conquest it must have declined tremendously, since there was no
   impediment when Henry the Third granted the site to my ancestor, Gilbert
   de la Poer, First Baron Exham, in 1261.

   Of my family before this date there is no evil report, but something
   strange must have happened then. In one chronicle there is a reference to
   a de la Poer as "cursed of God in 1307", whilst village legendry had
   nothing but evil and frantic fear to tell of the castle that went up on
   the foundations of the old temple and priory. The fireside tales were of
   the most grisly description, all the ghastlier because of their frightened
   reticence and cloudy evasiveness. They represented my ancestors as a race
   of hereditary daemons beside whom Gilles de Retz and the Marquis de Sade
   would seem the veriest tyros, and hinted whisperingly at their
   responsibility for the occasional disappearances of villagers through
   several generations.

   The worst characters, apparently, were the barons and their direct heirs;
   at least, most was whispered about these. If of healthier inclinations, it
   was said, an heir would early and mysteriously die to make way for another
   more typical scion. There seemed to be an inner cult in the family,
   presided over by the head of the house, and sometimes closed except to a
   few members. Temperament rather than ancestry was evidently the basis of
   this cult, for it was entered by several who married into the family. Lady
   Margaret Trevor from Cornwall, wife of Godfrey, the second son of the
   fifth baron, became a favourite bane of children all over the countryside,
   and the daemon heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet
   extinct near the Welsh border. Preserved in balladry, too, though not
   illustrating the same point, is the hideous tale of Lady Mary de la Poer,
   who shortly after her marriage to the Earl of Shrewsfield was killed by
   him and his mother, both of the slayers being absolved and blessed by the
   priest to whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the world.

   These myths and ballads, typical as they were of crude superstition,
   repelled me greatly. Their persistence, and their application to so long a
   line of my ancestors, were especially annoying; whilst the imputations of
   monstrous habits proved unpleasantly reminiscent of the one known scandal
   of my immediate forebears -- the case of my cousin, young Randolph
   Delapore of Carfax who went among the negroes and became a voodoo priest
   after he returned from the Mexican War.

   I was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and howlings in the
   barren, windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff; of the graveyard
   stenches after the spring rains; of the floundering, squealing white thing
   on which Sir John Clave's horse had trod one night in a lonely field; and
   of the servant who had gone mad at what he saw in the priory in the full
   light of day. These things were hackneyed spectral lore, and I was at that
   time a pronounced sceptic. The accounts of vanished peasants were less to
   be dismissed, though not especially significant in view of mediaeval
   custom. Prying curiosity meant death, and more than one severed head had
   been publicly shown on the bastions -- now effaced -- around Exham Priory.

   A few of the tales were exceedingly picturesque, and made me wish I had
   learnt more of the comparative mythology in my youth. There was, for
   instance, the belief that a legion of bat-winged devils kept witches'
   sabbath each night at the priory -- a legion whose sustenance might
   explain the disproportionate abundance of coarse vegetables harvested in
   the vast gardens. And, most vivid of all, there was the dramatic epic of
   the rats -- the scampering army of obscene vermin which had burst forth
   from the castle three months after the tragedy that doomed it to desertion
   -- the lean, filthy, ravenous army which had swept all before it and
   devoured fowl, cats, dogs, hogs, sheep, and even two hapless human beings
   before its fury was spent. Around that unforgettable rodent army a whole
   separate cycle of myths revolves, for it scattered among the village homes
   and brought curses and horrors in its train.

   Such was the lore that assailed me as I pushed to completion, with an
   elderly obstinacy, the work of restoring my ancestral home. It must not be
   imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological
   environinent. On the other hand, I was constantly praised and encouraged
   by Capt. Norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me. When the
   task was done, over two years after its commencement, I viewed the great
   rooms, wainscoted walls, vaulted ceilings, mullioned windows, and broad
   staircases with a pride which fully compensated for the prodigious expense
   of the restoration.

   Every attribute of the Middle Ages was cunningly reproduced and the new
   parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations. The seat
   of my fathers was complete, and I looked forward to redeeming at last the
   local fame of the line which ended in me. I could reside here permanently,
   and prove that a de la Poer (for I had adopted again the original spelling
   of the name) need not be a fiend. My comfort was perhaps augmented by the
   fact that, although Exham Priory was mediaevally fitted, its interior was
   in truth wholly new and free from old vermin and old ghosts alike.

   As I have said, I moved in on 16 July 1923. My household consisted of
   seven servants and nine cats, of which latter species I am particularly
   fond. My eldest cat, "Nigger-Man", was seven years old and had come with
   me from my home in Bolton, Massachusetts; the others I had accumulated
   whilst living with Capt. Norrys' family during the restoration of the
   priory.

   For five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity, my time
   being spent mostly in the codification of old family data. I had now
   obtained some very circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and flight
   of Walter de la Poer, which I conceived to be the probable contents of the
   hereditary paper lost in the fire at Carfax. It appeared that my ancestor
   was accused with much reason of having killed all the other members of his
   household, except four servant confederates, in their sleep, about two
   weeks after a shocking discovery which changed his whole demeanour, but
   which, except by implication, he disclosed to no one save perhaps the
   servants who assisted him and afterwards fled beyond reach.

   This deliberate slaughter, which included a father, three brothers, and
   two sisters, was largely condoned by the villagers, and so slackly treated
   by the law that its perpetrator escaped honoured, unharmed, and
   undisguised to Virginia; the general whispered sentiment being that he had
   purged the land of an immemorial curse. What discovery had prompted an act
   so terrible, I could scarcely even conjecture. Walter de la Poer must have
   known for years the sinister tales about his family, so that this material
   could have given him no fresh impulse. Had he, then, witnessed some
   appalling ancient rite, or stumbled upon some frightful and revealing
   symbol in the priory or its vicinity? He was reputed to have been a shy,
   gentle youth in England. In Virginia he seemed not so much hard or bitter
   as harassed and apprehensive. He was spoken of in the diary of another
   gentleman adventurer, Francis Harley of Bellview, as a man of unexampled
   justice, honour, and delicacy.

   On 22 July occurred the first incident which, though lightly dismissed at
   the time, takes on a preternatural significance in relation to later
   events. It was so simple as to be almost negligible, and could not
   possibly have been noticed under the circumstances; for it must be
   recalled that since I was in a building practically fresh and new except
   for the walls, and surrounded by a well-balanced staff of servitors,
   apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality.

   What I afterward remembered is merely this -- that my old black cat, whose
   moods I know so well, was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an extent
   wholly out of keeping with his natural character. He roved from room to
   room, restless and disturbed, and sniffed constantly about the walls which
   formed part of the Gothic structure. I realize how trite this sounds --
   like the inevitable dog in the ghost story, which always growls before his
   master sees the sheeted figure -- yet I cannot consistently suppress it.

   The following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the cats
   in the house. He came to me in my study, a lofty west room on the second
   storey, with groined arches, black oak panelling, and a triple Gothic
   window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley; and even as he
   spoke I saw the jetty form of Nigger-Man creeping along the west wall and
   scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient stone.

   I told the man that there must be a singular odour or emanation from the
   old stonework, imperceptible to human senses, but affecting the delicate
   organs of cats even through the new woodwork. This I truly believed, and
   when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats, I mentioned that
   there had been no rats there for three hundred years, and that even the
   field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be found in these high
   walls, where they had never been known to stray. That afternoon I called
   on Capt. Norrys, and he assured me that it would be quite incredible for
   field mice to infest the priory in such a sudden and unprecedented
   fashion.

   That night, dispensing as usual with a valet, I retired in the west tower
   chamber which I had chosen as my own, reached from the study by a stone
   staircase and short gallery -- the former partly ancient, the latter
   entirely restored. This room was circular, very high, and without
   wainscoting, being hung with arras which I had myself chosen in London.

   Seeing that Nigger-Man was with me, I shut the heavy Gothic door and
   retired by the light of the electric bulbs which so cleverly counterfeited
   candles, finally switching off the light and sinking on the carved and
   canopied four-poster, with the venerable cat in his accustomed place
   across my feet. I did not draw the curtains, but gazed out at the narrow
   window which I faced. There was a suspicion of aurora in the sky, and the
   delicate traceries of the window were pleasantly silhouetted.

   At some time I must have fallen quietly asleep, for I recall a distinct
   sense of leaving strange dreams, when the cat started violently from his
   placid position. I saw him in the faint auroral glow, head strained
   forward, fore feet on my ankles, and hind feet stretched behind. He was
   looking intensely at a point on the wall somewhat west of the window, a
   point which to my eye had nothing to mark it, but toward which all my
   attention was now directed.

   And as I watched, I knew that Nigger-Man was not vainly excited. Whether
   the arras actually moved I cannot say. I think it did, very slightly. But
   what I can swear to is that behind it I heard a low, distinct scurrying as
   of rats or mice. In a moment the cat had jumped bodily on the screening
   tapestry, bringing the affected section to the floor with his weight, and
   exposing a damp, ancient wall of stone; patched here and there by the
   restorers, and devoid of any trace of rodent prowlers.

   Nigger-Man raced up and down the floor by this part of the wall, clawing
   the fallen arras and seemingly trying at times to insert a paw between the
   wall and the oaken floor. He found nothing, and after a time returned
   wearily to his place across my feet. I had not moved, but I did not sleep
   again that night.

   In the morning I questioned all the servants, and found that none of them
   had noticed anything unusual, save that the cook remembered the actions of
   a cat which had rested on her windowsill. This cat had howled at some
   unknown hour of the night, awaking the cook in time for her to see him
   dart purposefully out of the open door down the stairs. I drowsed away the
   noontime, and in the afternoon called again on Capt. Norrys, who became
   exceedingly interested in what I told him. The odd incidents -- so slight
   yet so curious -- appealed to his sense of the picturesque and elicited
   from him a number of reminiscenses of local ghostly lore. We were
   genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats, and Norrys lent me some traps
   and Paris green, which I had the servants place in strategic localities
   when I returned.

   I retired early, being very sleepy, but was harassed by dreams of the most
   horrible sort. I seemed to be looking down from an immense height upon a
   twilit grotto, knee-deep with filth, where a white-bearded daemon
   swineherd drove about with his staff a flock of fungous, flabby beasts
   whose appearance filled me with unutterable loathing. Then, as the
   swineherd paused and nodded over his task, a mighty swarm of rats rained
   down on the stinking abyss and fell to devouring beasts and man alike.

   From this terrific vision I was abruptly awakened by the motions of
   Nigger-Man, who had been sleeping as usual across my feet. This time I did
   not have to question the source of his snarls and hisses, and of the fear
   which made him sink his claws into my ankle, unconscious of their effect;
   for on every side of the chamber the walls were alive with nauseous sound
   -- the veminous slithering of ravenous, gigantic rats. There was now no
   aurora to show the state of the arras -- the fallen section of which had
   been replaced - but I was not too frightened to switch on the light.

   As the bulbs leapt into radiance I saw a hideous shaking all over the
   tapestry, causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular
   dance of death. This motion disappeared almost at once, and the sound with
   it. Springing out of bed, I poked at the arras with the long handle of a
   warming-pan that rested near, and lifted one section to see what lay
   beneath. There was nothing but the patched stone wall, and even the cat
   had lost his tense realization of abnormal presences. When I examined the
   circular trap that had been placed in the room, I found all of the
   openings sprung, though no trace remained of what had been caught and had
   escaped.

   Further sleep was out of the question, so lighting a candle, I opened the
   door and went out in the gallery towards the stairs to my study,
   Nigger-Man following at my heels. Before we had reached the stone steps,
   however, the cat darted ahead of me and vanished down the ancient flight.
   As I descended the stairs myself, I became suddenly aware of sounds in the
   great room below; sounds of a nature which could not be mistaken.

   The oak-panelled walls were alive with rats, scampering and milling whilst
   Nigger-Man was racing about with the fury of a baffled hunter. Reaching
   the bottom, I switched on the light, which did not this time cause the
   noise to subside. The rats continued their riot, stampeding with such
   force and distinctness that I could finally assign to their motions a
   definite direction. These creatures, in numbers apparently inexhaustible,
   were engaged in one stupendous migration from inconceivable heights to
   some depth conceivably or inconceivably below.

   I now heard steps in the corridor, and in another moment two servants
   pushed open the massive door. They were searching the house for some
   unknown source of disturbance which had thrown all the cats into a
   snarling panic and caused them to plunge precipitately down several
   flights of stairs and squat, yowling, before the closed door to the
   sub-cellar. I asked them if they had heard the rats, but they replied in
   the negative. And when I turned to call their attention to the sounds in
   the panels, I realized that the noise had ceased.

   With the two men, I went down to the door of the sub-cellar, but found the
   cats already dispersed. Later I resolved to explore the crypt below, but
   for the present I merely made a round of the traps. All were sprung, yet
   all were tenantless. Satisfying myself that no one had heard the rats save
   the felines and me, I sat in my study till morning, thinking profoundly
   and recalling every scrap of legend I had unearthed concerning the
   building I inhabited. I slept some in the forenoon, leaning back in the
   one comfortable library chair which my mediaeval plan of furnishing could
   not banish. Later I telephoned to Capt. Norrys, who came over and helped
   me explore the sub-cellar.

   Absolutely nothing untoward was found, although we could not repress a
   thrill at the knowledge that this vault was built by Roman hands. Every
   low arch and massive pillar was Roman -- not the debased Romanesque of the
   bungling Saxons, but the severe and harmonious classicism of the age of
   the Caesars; indeed, the walls abounded with inscriptions familiar to the
   antiquarians who had repeatedly explored the place -- things like "P.
   GETAE. PROP... TEMP... DONA..." and "L. PRAEG... VS... PONTIFI... ATYS..."

   The reference to Atys made me shiver, for I had read Catullus and knew
   something of the hideous rites of the Eastern god, whose worship was so
   mixed with that of Cybele. Norrys and I, by the light of lanterns, tried
   to interpret the odd and nearly effaced designs on certain irregularly
   rectangular blocks of stone generally held to be altars, but could make
   nothing of them. We remembered that one pattern, a sort of rayed sun, was
   held by students to imply a non-Roman origin suggesting that these altars
   had merely been adopted by the Roman priests from some older and perhaps
   aboriginal temple on the same site. On one of these blocks were some brown
   stains which made me wonder. The largest, in the centre of the room, had
   certain features on the upper surface which indicated its connection with
   fire -- probably burnt offerings.

   Such were the sights in that crypt before whose door the cats howled, and
   where Norrys and I now determined to pass the night. Couches were brought
   down by the servants, who were told not to mind any nocturnal actions of
   the cats, and Nigger-Man was admitted as much for help as for
   companionship. We decided to keep the great oak door -- a modern replica
   with slits for ventilation -- tightly closed; and, with this attended to,
   we retired with lanterns still burning to await whatever might occur.

   The vault was very deep in the foundations of the priory, and undoubtedly
   far down on the face of the beetling limestone cliff overlooking the waste
   valley. That it had been the goal of the scuffling and unexplainable rats
   I could not doubt, though why, I could not tell. As we lay there
   expectantly, I found my vigil occasionally mixed with half-formed dreams
   from which the uneasy motions of the cat across my feet would rouse me.

   These dreams were not wholesome, but horribly like the one I had had the
   night before. I saw again the twilit grotto, and the swineherd with his
   unmentionable fungous beasts wallowing in filth, and as I looked at these
   things they seemed nearer and more distinct -- so distinct that I could
   almost observe their features. Then I did observe the flabby features of
   one of them -- and awakened with such a scream that Nigger-Man started up,
   whilst Capt. Norrys, who had not slept, laughed considerably. Norrys might
   have laughed more -- or perhaps less -- had he known what it was that made
   me scream. But I did not remember myself till later. Ultimate horror often
   paralyses memory in a merciful way.

   Norrys waked me when the phenomena began. Out of the same frightful dream
   I was called by his gentle shaking and his urging to listen to the cats.
   Indeed, there was much to listen to, for beyond the closed door at the
   head of the stone steps was a veritable nightmare of feline yelling and
   clawing, whilst Nigger-Man, unmindful of his kindred outside, was running
   excitedly round the bare stone walls, in which I heard the same babel of
   scurrying rats that had troubled me the night before.

   An acute terror now rose within me, for here were anomalies which nothing
   normal could well explain. These rats, if not the creatures of a madness
   which I shared with the cats alone, must be burrowing and sliding in Roman
   walls I had thought to be solid limestone blocks ... unless perhaps the
   action of water through more than seventeen centuries had eaten winding
   tunnels which rodent bodies had worn clear and ample ... But even so, the
   spectral horror was no less; for if these were living vermin why did not
   Norrys hear their disgusting commotion? Why did he urge me to watch
   Nigger-Man and listen to the cats outside, and why did he guess wildly and
   vaguely at what could have aroused them?

   By the time I had managed to tell him, as rationally as I could, what I
   thought I was hearing, my ears gave me the last fading impression of
   scurrying; which had retreated still downward, far underneath this deepest
   of sub-cellars till it seemed as if the whole cliff below were riddled
   with questing rats. Norrys was not as sceptical as I had anticipated, but
   instead seemed profoundly moved. He motioned to me to notice that the cats
   at the door had ceased their clamour, as if giving up the rats for lost;
   whilst Nigger-Man had a burst of renewed restlessness, and was clawing
   frantically around the bottom of the large stone altar in the centre of
   the room, which was nearer Norrys' couch than mine.

   My fear of the unknown was at this point very great. Something astounding
   had occurred, and I saw that Capt. Norrys, a younger, stouter, and
   presumably more naturally materialistic man, was affected fully as much as
   myself -- perhaps because of his lifelong and intimate familiarity with
   local legend. We could for the moment do nothing but watch the old black
   cat as he pawed with decreasing fervour at the base of the altar,
   occasionally looking up and mewing to me in that persuasive manner which
   he used when he wished me to perform some favour for him.

   Norrys now took a lantern close to the altar and examined the place where
   Nigger-Man was pawing; silently kneeling and scraping away the lichens of
   the centuries which joined the massive pre-Roman block to the tessellated
   floor. He did not find anything, and was about to abandon his efforts when
   I noticed a trivial circumstance which made me shudder, even though it
   implied nothing more than I had already imagined.

   I told him of it, and we both looked at its almost imperceptible
   manifestation with the fixedness of fascinated discovery and
   acknowledgment. It was only this -- that the flame of the lantern set down
   near the altar was slightly but certainly flickering from a draught of air
   which it had not before received, and which came indubitably from the
   crevice between floor and altar where Norrys was scraping away the
   lichens.

   We spent the rest of the night in the brilliantly-lighted study, nervously
   discussing what we should do next. The discovery that some vault deeper
   than the deepest known masonry of the Romans underlay this accursed pile,
   some vault unsuspected by the curious antiquarians of three centuries,
   would have been sufficient to excite us without any background of the
   sinister. As it was, the fascination became two-fold; and we paused in
   doubt whether to abandon our search and quit the priory forever in
   superstitious caution, or to gratify our sense of adventure and brave
   whatever horrors might await us in the unknown depths.

   By morning we had compromised, and decided to go to London to gather a
   group of archaeologists and scientific men fit to cope with the mystery.
   It should be mentioned that before leaving the sub-cellar we had vainly
   tried to move the central altar which we now recognized as the gate to a
   new pit of nameless fear. What secret would open the gate, wiser men than
   we would have to find.

   During many days in London Capt. Norrys and I presented our facts,
   conjectures, and legendary anecdotes to five eminent authorities, all men
   who could be trusted to respect any family disclosures which future
   explorations might develop. We found most of them little disposed to scoff
   but, instead, intensely interested and sincerely sympathetic. It is hardly
   necessary to name them all, but I may say that they included Sir William
   Brinton, whose excavations in the Troad excited most of the world in their
   day. As we all took the train for Anchester I felt myself poised on the
   brink of frightful revelations, a sensation symbolized by the air of
   mourning among the many Americans at the unexpected death of the President
   on the other side of the world.

   On the evening of 7 August we reached Exham Priory, where the servants
   assured me that nothing unusual had occurred. The cats, even old
   Nigger-Man, had been perfectly placid, and not a trap in the house had
   been sprung. We were to begin exploring on the following dlay, awaiting
   which I assigned well-appointed rooms to all my guests.

   I myself retired in my own tower chamber, with Nigger-Man across my feet.
   Sleep came quickly, but hideous dreams assailed me. There was a vision of
   a Roman feast like that of Trimalchio, with a horror in a covered platter.
   Then came that damnable, recurrent thing about the swineherd and his
   filthy drove in the twilit grotto. Yet when I awoke it was full daylight,
   with normal sounds in the house below. The rats, living or spectral, had
   not troubled me; and Nigger-Man was still quietly asleep. On going down, I
   found that the same tranquillity had prevailed elsewhere; a condition
   which one of the assembled servants -- a fellow named Thornton, devoted to
   the psychic -- rather absurdly laid to the fact that I had now been shown
   the thing which certain forces had wished to show me.

   All was now ready, and at 11 A.M. our entire group of seven men, bearing
   powerful electric searchlights and implements of excavation, went down to
   the sub-cellar and bolted the door behind us. Nigger-Man was with us, for
   the investigators found no occasion to depise his excitability, and were
   indeed anxious that he be present in case of obscure rodent
   manifestations. We noted the Roman inscriptions and unknown altar designs
   only briefly, for three of the savants had already seen them, and all knew
   their characteristics. Prime attention was paid to the momentous central
   altar, and within an hour Sir William Brinton had caused it to tilt
   backward, balanced by some unknown species of counterweight.

   There now lay revealed such a horror as would have overwhelmed us had we
   not been prepared. Through a nearly square opening in the tiled floor,
   sprawling on a flight of stone steps so prodigiously worn that it was
   little more than an inclined plane at the centre, was a ghastly array of
   human or semi-human bones. Those which retained their collocation as
   skeletons showed attitudes of panic fear, and over all were the marks of
   rodent gnawing. The skulls denoted nothing short of utter idiocy,
   cretinism, or primitive semi-apedom.

   Above the hellishly littered steps arched a descending passage seemingly
   chiselled from the solid rock, and conducting a current of air. This
   current was not a sudden and noxious rush as from a closed vault, but a
   cool breeze with something of freshness in it. We did not pause long, but
   shiveringly began to clear a passage down the steps. It was then that Sir
   William, examining the hewn walls, made the odd observation that the
   passage, according to the direction of the strokes, must have been
   chiselled from beneath.

   I must be very deliberate now, and choose my words. After ploughing down a
   few steps amidst the gnawled bones we saw that there was light ahead; not
   any mystic phosphorescence, but a filtered daylight which could not come
   except from unknown fissures in the cliff that over-looked the waste
   valley. That such fissures had escaped notice from outside was hardly
   remarkable, for not only is the valley wholly uninhabited, but the cliff
   is so high and beetling that only an aeronaut could study its face in
   detail. A few steps more, and our breaths were literally snatched from us
   by what we saw; so literally that Thornton, the psychic investigator,
   actually fainted in the arms of the dazed mem who stood behind him.
   Norrys, his plump face utterly white and flabby, simply cried out
   inarticulately; whilst I think that what I did was to gasp or hiss, and
   cover my eyes.

   The man behind me -- the only one of the party older than I -- croaked the
   hackneyed "My God!" in the most cracked voice I ever heard. Of seven
   cultivated men, only Sir William Brinton retained his composure, a thing
   the more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the
   sight first.

   It was a twilit grotto of enormous height, stretching away farther than
   any eye could see; a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and horrible
   suggestion. There were buildings and other architectural remains -- in one
   terrified glance I saw a weird pattern of tumuli, a savage circle of
   monoliths, a low-domed Roman ruin, a sprawling Saxon pile, and an early
   English edifice of wood -- but all these were dwarfed by the ghoulish
   spectacle presented by the general surface of the ground. For yards about
   the steps extended an insane tangle of human bones, or bones at least as
   human as those on the steps. Like a foamy sea they stretched, some fallen
   apart, but others wholly or partly articulated as skeletons; these latter
   invariably in postures of daemoniac frenzy, either fighting off some
   menace or clutching other forms with cannibal intent.

   When Dr Trask, the anthropologist, stopped to classify the skulls, he
   found a degraded mixture which utterly baffled him. They were mostly lower
   than the Piltdown man in the scale of evolution, but in every case
   definitely human. Many were of higher grade, and a very few were the
   skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types. All the bones were
   gnawed, mostly by rats, but somewhat by others of the half-human drove.
   Mixed with them were many tiny hones of rats -- fallen members of the
   lethal army which closed the ancient epic.

   I wonder that any man among us lived and kept his sanity through that
   hideous day of discovery. Not Hoffman nor Huysmans could conceive a scene
   more wildly incredible, more frenetically repellent, or more Gothically
   grotesque than the twilit grotto through which we seven staggered; each
   stumbling on revelation after revelation, and trying to keep for the nonce
   from thinking of the events which must have taken place there three
   hundred, or a thousand, or two thousand or ten thousand years ago. It was
   the antechamber of hell, and poor Thornton fainted again when Trask told
   him that some of the skeleton things must have descended as quadrupeds
   through the last twenty or more generations.

   Horror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural remains.
   The quadruped things -- with their occasional recruits from the biped
   class -- had been kept in stone pens, out of which they must have broken
   in their last delirium of hunger or rat-fear. There had been great herds
   of them, evidently fattened on the coarse vegetables whose remains could
   be found as a sort of poisonous ensilage at the bottom of the huge stone
   bins older than Rome. I knew now why my ancestors had had such excessive
   gardens -- would to heaven I could forget! The purpose of the herds I did
   not have to ask.

   Sir William, standing with his searchlight in the Roman ruin, translated
   aloud the most shocking ritual I have ever known; and told of the diet of
   the antediluvian cult which the priests of Cybele found and mingled with
   their own. Norrys, used as he was to the trenches, could not walk straight
   when he came out of the English building. It was a butcher shop and
   kitchen -- he had expected that -- but it was too much to see familiar
   English implements in such a place, and to read familiar English graffiti
   there, some as recent as 1610. I could not go in that building -- that
   building whose daemon activities were stopped only by the dagger of my
   ancestor Walter de la Poer.

   What I did venture to enter was the low Saxon building whose oaken door
   had fallen, and there I found a terrible row of ten stone cells with rusty
   bars. Three had tenants, all skeletons of high grade, and on the bony
   forefinger of one I found a seal ring with my own coat-of-arms. Sir
   William found a vault with far older cells below the Roman chapel, but
   these cells were empty. Below them was a low crypt with cases of formally
   arranged bones, some of them bearing terrible parallel inscriptions carved
   in Latin, Greek, and the tongue of Phyrgia.

   Meanwhile, Dr Trask had opened one of the prehistoric tumuli, and brought
   to light skulls which were slightly more human than a gorilla's, and which
   bore indescribably ideographic carvings. Through all this horror my cat
   stalked unperturbed. Once I saw him monstrously perched atop a mountain of
   bones, and wondered at the secrets that might lie behind his yellow eyes.

   Having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this
   twilit area -- an area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent dream --
   we turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern where no
   ray of light from the cliff could penetrate. We shall never know what
   sightless Stygian worlds yawn beyond the little distance we went, for it
   was decided that such secrets are not good for mankind. But there was
   plenty to engross us close at hand, for we had not gone far before the
   searchlights showed that accursed infinity of pits in which the rats had
   feasted, and whose sudden lack of replenishment had driven the ravenous
   rodent army first to turn on the living herds of starving things, and then
   to burst forth from the priory in that historic orgy of devastation which
   the peasants will never forget.

   God! those carrion black pits of sawed, picked bones and opened skulls!
   Those nightmare chasms choked with the pithecanthropoid, Celtic, Roman,
   and English bones of countless unhallowed centuries! Some of them were
   full, and none can say how deep they had once been. Others were still
   bottomless to our searchlights, and peopled by unnamable fancies. What, I
   thought, of the hapless rats that stumbled into such traps amidst the
   blackness of their quests in this grisly Tartarus?

   Once my foot slipped near a horribly yawning brink, and I had a moment of
   ecstatic fear. I must have been musing a long time, for I could not see
   any of the party but plump Capt. Norrys. Then there came a sound from that
   inky, boundless, farther distance that I thought I knew; and I saw my old
   black cat dart past me like a winged Egyptian god, straight into the
   illimitable gulf of the unknown. But I was not far behind, for there was
   no doubt after another second. It was the eldritch scurrying of those
   fiend-born rats, always questing for new horrors, and determined to lead
   me on even unto those grinning caverns of earth's centre where
   Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god, howls blindly in the darkness to the
   piping of two amorphous idiot flute-players.

   My searchlight expired, but still I ran. I heard voices, and yowls, and
   echoes, but above all there gently rose that impious, insidious scurrying;
   gently rising, rising, as a stiff bloated corpse gently rises above an
   oily river that flows under the endless onyx bridges to a black, putrid
   sea.

   Something bumped into me -- something soft and plump. It must have been
   the rats; the viscous, gelatinous, ravenous army that feast on the dead
   and the living ... Why shouldn't rats eat a de la Poer as a de la Poer
   eats forbidden things? ... The war ate my boy, damn them all ... and the
   Yanks ate Carfax with flames and burnt Grandsire Delapore and the secret
   ... No, no, I tell you, I am not that daemon swineherd in the twilit
   grotto! It was not Edward Norrys' fat face on that flabby fungous thing!
   Who says I am a de la Poer? He lived, but my boy died! ... Shall a Norrys
   hold the land of a de la Poer? ... It's voodoo, I tell you ... that
   spotted snake ... Curse you, Thornton, I'll teach you to faint at what my
   family do! ... 'Sblood, thou stinkard, I'll learn ye how to gust ... wolde
   ye swynke me thilke wys?... Magna Mater! Magna Mater!... Atys... Dia ad
   aghaidh's ad aodaun... agus bas dunarch ort! Dhonas 's dholas ort, agus
   leat-sa!... Ungl unl... rrlh ... chchch...

   This is what they say I said when they found me in the blackness after
   three hours; found me crouching in the blackness over the plump,
   half-eaten body of Capt. Norrys, with my own cat leaping and tearing at my
   throat. Now they have blown up Exham Priory, taken my Nigger-Man away from
   me, and shut me into this barred room at Hanwell with fearful whispers
   about my heredity and experience. Thornton is in the next room, but they
   prevent me from talking to him. They are trying, too, to suppress most of
   the facts concerning the priory. When I speak of poor Norrys they accuse
   me of this hideous thing, but they must know that I did not do it. They
   must know it was the rats; the slithering scurrying rats whose scampering
   will never let me sleep; the daemon rats that race behind the padding in
   this room and beckon me down to greater horrors than I have ever known;
   the rats they can never hear; the rats, the rats in the walls.
