Despair

  by H.P. Lovecraft

                                 February 1919

                     O'er the midnight moorlands crying,    
                     Thro' the cypress forests sighing,     
                     In the night-wind madly flying,        
                       Hellish forms with streaming hair;   
                     In the barren branches creaking,       
                     By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking,  
                     Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking,  
                       Damn'd demons of despair.            
                                                            
                     Once, I think I half remember,         
                     Ere the grey skies of November         
                     Quench'd my youth's aspiring ember,    
                       Liv'd there such a thing as bliss;   
                     Skies that now are dark were beaming,  
                     Bold and azure, splendid seeming       
                     Till I learn'd it all was dreaming --  
                       Deadly drowsiness of Dis.            
                                                            
                     But the stream of Time, swift flowing, 
                     Brings the torment of half-knowing --  
                     Dimly rushing, blindly going           
                       Past the never-trodden lea;          
                     And the voyager, repining,             
                     Sees the wicked death-fires shining,   
                     Hears the wicked petrel's whining      
                       As he helpless drifts to sea.        
                                                            
                     Evil wings in ether beating;           
                     Vultures at the spirit eating;         
                     Things unseen forever fleeting         
                       Black against the leering sky.       
                     Ghastly shades of bygone gladness,     
                     Clawing fiends of future sadness,      
                     Mingle in a cloud of madness           
                       Ever on the soul to lie.             
                                                            
                     Thus the living, lone and sobbing,     
                     In the throes of anguish throbbing,    
                     With the loathsome Furies robbing      
                       Night and noon of peace and rest.    
                     But beyond the groans and grating      
                     Of abhorrent Life, is waiting          
                     Sweet Oblivion, culminating            
                       All the years of fruitless quest.
