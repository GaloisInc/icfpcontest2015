Christmastide

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                   The cottage hearth beams warm and bright, 
                      The candles gaily glow;                
                   The stars emit a kinder light             
                      Above the drifted snow.                
                                                             
                   Down from the sky a magic steals          
                      To glad the passing year,              
                   And belfries sing with joyous peals,      
                      For Christmastide is here!
