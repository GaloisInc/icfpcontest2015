   I am Basil Elton, keeper of the North Point light that my father and
   grandfather kept before me. Far from the shore stands the gray lighthouse,
   above sunken slimy rocks that are seen when the tide is low, but unseen
   when the tide is high. Past that beacon for a century have swept the
   majestic barques of the seven seas. In the days of my grandfather there
   were many; in the days of my father not so many; and now there are so few
   that I sometimes feel strangely alone, as though I were the last man on
   our planet.

   From far shores came those white-sailed argosies of old; from far Eastern
   shores where warm suns shine and sweet odors linger about strange gardens
   and gay temples. The old captains of the sea came often to my grandfather
   and told him of these things which in turn he told to my father, and my
   father told to me in the long autumn evenings when the wind howled eerily
   from the East. And I have read more of these things, and of many things
   besides, in the books men gave me when I was young and filled with wonder.

   But more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the
   secret lore of ocean. Blue, green, gray, white or black; smooth, ruffled,
   or mountainous; that ocean is not silent. All my days have I watched it
   and listened to it, and I know it well. At first it told to me only the
   plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with the years it
   grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things more strange and
   more distant in space and time. Sometimes at twilight the gray vapors of
   the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the ways beyond; and
   sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have grown clear and
   phosphorescent, to grant me glimpses of the ways beneath. And these
   glimpses have been as often of the ways that were and the ways that might
   be, as of the ways that are; for ocean is more ancient than the mountains,
   and freighted with the memories and the dreams of Time.

   Out of the South it was that the White Ship used to come when the moon was
   full and high in the heavens. Out of the South it would glide very
   smoothly and silently over the sea. And whether the sea was rough or calm,
   and whether the wind was friendly or adverse, it would always glide
   smoothly and silently, its sails distant and its long strange tiers of
   oars moving rhythmically. One night I espied upon the deck a man, bearded
   and robed, and he seemed to beckon me to embark for far unknown shores.
   Many times afterward I saw him under the full moon, and never did he
   beckon me.

   Very brightly did the moon shine on the night I answered the call, and I
   walked out over the waters to the White Ship on a bridge of moonbeams. The
   man who had beckoned now spoke a welcome to me in a soft language I seemed
   to know well, and the hours were filled with soft songs of the oarsmen as
   we glided away into a mysterious South, golden with the glow of that full,
   mellow moon.

   And when the day dawned, rosy and effulgent, I beheld the green shore of
   far lands, bright and beautiful, and to me unknown. Up from the sea rose
   lordly terraces of verdure, tree-studded, and shewing here and there the
   gleaming white roofs and colonnades of strange temples. As we drew nearer
   the green shore the bearded man told me of that land, the land of Zar,
   where dwell all the dreams and thoughts of beauty that come to men once
   and then are forgotten. And when I looked upon the terraces again I saw
   that what he said was true, for among the sights before me were many
   things I had once seen through the mists beyond the horizon and in the
   phosphorescent depths of ocean. There too were forms and fantasies more
   splendid than any I had ever known; the visions of young poets who died in
   want before the world could learn of what they had seen and dreamed. But
   we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of Zar, for it is told that
   he who treads them may nevermore return to his native shore.

   As the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of Zar,
   we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city; and
   the bearded man said to me, "This is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand
   Wonders, wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain
   to fathom." And I looked again, at closer range, and saw that the city was
   greater than any city I had known or dreamed of before. Into the sky the
   spires of its temples reached, so that no man might behold their peaks;
   and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim, gray walls, over which
   one might spy only a few roofs, weird and ominous, yet adorned with rich
   friezes and alluring sculptures. I yearned mightily to enter this
   fascinating yet repellent city, and besought the bearded man to land me at
   the stone pier by the huge carven gate Akariel; but he gently denied my
   wish, saying, "Into Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have
   passed but none returned. Therein walk only daemons and mad things that
   are no longer men, and the streets are white with the unburied bones of
   those who have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that reigns over the city."
   So the White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion, and followed for
   many days a southward-flying bird, whose glossy plumage matched the sky
   out of which it had appeared.

   Then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where as
   far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbors beneath
   a meridian sun. From bowers beyond our view came bursts of song and
   snatches of lyric harmony, interspersed with faint laughter so delicious
   that I urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the scene. And the
   bearded man spoke no word, but watched me as we approached the lily-lined
   shore. Suddenly a wind blowing from over the flowery meadows and leafy
   woods brought a scent at which I trembled. The wind grew stronger, and the
   air was filled with the lethal, charnel odor of plague-stricken towns and
   uncovered cemeteries. And as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast
   the bearded man spoke at last, saying, "This is Xura, the Land of
   Pleasures Unattained."

   So once more the White Ship followed the bird of heaven, over warm blessed
   seas fanned by caressing, aromatic breezes. Day after day and night after
   night did we sail, and when the moon was full we would listen to soft
   songs of the oarsmen, sweet as on that distant night when we sailed away
   from my far native land. And it was by moonlight that we anchored at last
   in the harbor of Sona-Nyl, which is guarded by twin headlands of crystal
   that rise from the sea and meet in a resplendent arch. This is the Land of
   Fancy, and we walked to the verdant shore upon a golden bridge of
   moonbeams.

   In the Land of Sona-Nyl there is neither time nor space, neither suffering
   nor death; and there I dwelt for many aeons. Green are the groves and
   pastures, bright and fragrant the flowers, blue and musical the streams,
   clear and cool the fountains, and stately and gorgeous the temples,
   castles, and cities of Sona-Nyl. Of that land there is no bound, for
   beyond each vista of beauty rises another more beautiful. Over the
   countryside and amidst the splendor of cities can move at will the happy
   folk, of whom all are gifted with unmarred grace and unalloyed happiness.
   For the aeons that I dwelt there I wandered blissfully through gardens
   where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing clumps of bushes, and where the
   white walks are bordered with delicate blossoms. I climbed gentle hills
   from whose summits I could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness, with
   steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys, and with the golden domes of
   gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon. And I viewed
   by moonlight the sparkling sea, the crystal headlands, and the placid
   harbor wherein lay anchored the White Ship.

   It was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of Tharp
   that I saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird, and felt the
   first stirrings of unrest. Then I spoke with the bearded man, and told him
   of my new yearnings to depart for remote Cathuria, which no man hath seen,
   but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars of the West. It is
   the Land of Hope, and in it shine the perfect ideals of all that we know
   elsewhere; or at least so men relate. But the bearded man said to me,
   "Beware of those perilous seas wherein men say Cathuria lies. In Sona-Nyl
   there is no pain or death, but who can tell what lies beyond the basalt
   pillars of the West?" Natheless at the next full moon I boarded the White
   Ship, and with the reluctant bearded man left the happy harbor for
   untraveled seas.

   And the bird of heaven flew before, and led us toward the basalt pillars
   of the West, but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under the full
   moon. In my mind I would often picture the unknown Land of Cathuria with
   its splendid groves and palaces, and would wonder what new delights there
   awaited me. "Cathuria," I would say to myself, "is the abode of gods and
   the land of unnumbered cities of gold. Its forests are of aloe and
   sandalwood, even as the fragrant groves of Camorin, and among the trees
   flutter gay birds sweet with song. On the green and flowery mountains of
   Cathuria stand temples of pink marble, rich with carven and painted
   glories, and having in their courtyards cool fountains of silver, where
   purr with ravishing music the scented waters that come from the
   grotto-born river Narg. And the cities of Cathuria are cinctured with
   golden walls, and their pavements also are of gold. In the gardens of
   these cities are strange orchids, and perfumed lakes whose beds are of
   coral and amber. At night the streets and the gardens are lit with gay
   lanthorns fashioned from the three-colored shell of the tortoise, and here
   resound the soft notes of the singer and the lutanist. And the houses of
   the cities of Cathuria are all palaces, each built over a fragrant canal
   bearing the waters of the sacred Narg. Of marble and porphyry are the
   houses, and roofed with glittering gold that reflects the rays of the sun
   and enhances the splendor of the cities as blissful gods view them from
   the distant peaks. Fairest of all is the palace of the great monarch
   Dorieb, whom some say to be a demi-god and others a god. High is the
   palace of Dorieb, and many are the turrets of marble upon its walls. In
   its wide halls many multitudes assemble, and here hang the trophies of the
   ages. And the roof is of pure gold, set upon tall pillars of ruby and
   azure, and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks
   up to those heights seems to gaze upon the living Olympus. And the floor
   of the palace is of glass, under which flow the cunningly lighted waters
   of the Narg, gay with gaudy fish not known beyond the bounds of lovely
   Cathuria."

   Thus would I speak to myself of Cathuria, but ever would the bearded man
   warn me to turn back to the happy shore of Sona-Nyl; for Sona-Nyl is known
   of men, while none hath ever beheld Cathuria.

   And on the thirty-first day that we followed the bird, we beheld the
   basalt pillars of the West. Shrouded in mist they were, so that no man
   might peer beyond them or see their summits -- which indeed some say reach
   even to the heavens. And the bearded man again implored me to turn back,
   but I heeded him not; for from the mists beyond the basalt pillars I
   fancied there came the notes of singers and lutanists; sweeter than the
   sweetest songs of Sona-Nyl, and sounding mine own praises; the praises of
   me, who had voyaged far from the full moon and dwelt in the Land of Fancy.
   So to the sound of melody the White Ship sailed into the mist betwixt the
   basalt pillars of the West. And when the music ceased and the mist lifted,
   we beheld not the Land of Cathuria, but a swift-rushing resistless sea,
   over which our helpless barque was borne toward some unknown goal. Soon to
   our ears came the distant thunder of falling waters, and to our eyes
   appeared on the far horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous
   cataract, wherein the oceans of the world drop down to abysmal
   nothingness. Then did the bearded man say to me, with tears on his cheek,
   "We have rejected the beautiful Land of Sona-Nyl, which we may never
   behold again. The gods are greater than men, and they have conquered." And
   I closed my eyes before the crash that I knew would come, shutting out the
   sight of the celestial bird which flapped its mocking blue wings over the
   brink of the torrent.

   Out of that crash came darkness, and I heard the shrieking of men and of
   things which were not men. From the East tempestuous winds arose, and
   chilled me as I crouched on the slab of damp stone which had risen beneath
   my feet. Then as I heard another crash I opened my eyes and beheld myself
   upon the platform of that lighthouse whence I had sailed so many aeons
   ago. In the darkness below there loomed the vast blurred outlines of a
   vessel breaking up on the cruel rocks, and as I glanced out over the waste
   I saw that the light had failed for the first time since my grandfather
   had assumed its care.

   And in the later watches of the night, when I went within the tower, I saw
   on the wall a calendar which still remained as when I had left it at the
   hour I sailed away. With the dawn I descended the tower and looked for
   wreckage upon the rocks, but what I found was only this: a strange dead
   bird whose hue was as of the azure sky, and a single shattered spar, of a
   whiteness greater than that of the wave-tips or of the mountain snow.

   And thereafter the ocean told me its secrets no more; and though many
   times since has the moon shone full and high in the heavens, the White
   Ship from the South came never again.
