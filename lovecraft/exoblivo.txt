   When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began
   to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let
   fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victims body, I loved the
   irradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I
   had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted
   woods.

   Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and
   sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.

   Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream
   under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight,
   iridescent arbours, and undying roses.

   And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and
   ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by
   a little gate of bronze.

   Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I
   pause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and
   twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to
   trunk, some times disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples.
   And alway the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the
   little gate of bronze therein.

   After a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from
   their greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through
   the valley and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize them for
   my eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back to a dull
   world stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the little
   gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from
   which, once it was entered, there would be no return.

   So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in
   the ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I would
   tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely,
   but more lovely and radiant as well.

   Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus
   filled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city, and
   who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were
   written many things concerning the world of dream, and among them was lore
   of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall
   pierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that it
   touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in the
   yellowed papyrus.

   Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the
   irrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew
   not which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross for ever into the
   unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new
   horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So
   when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me
   through, I resolved to take it when next I awaked.

   Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden
   valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique
   wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a
   glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried
   temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land
   from whence I should never return.

   But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of the drug and the dream
   pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for
   in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of
   unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hope to
   be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from
   which the daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour.
