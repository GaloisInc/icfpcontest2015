Egyptian Christmas

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                      Haughty Sphinx, whose amber eyes    
                      Hold the secrets of the skies,      
                      As thou ripplest in thy grace,      
                      Round the chairs and chimney-place, 
                      Scorn on thy patrician face:        
                      Rise not harsh, nor use thy claws   
                      On the hand that gives applause--   
                      Good-will only doth abide           
                      In these lines at Christmastide!
