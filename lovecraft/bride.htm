				<p>Black loom the crags of the uplands behind me,
				<br>Dark are the sands of the far-stretching shore.
				<br>Dim are the pathways and rocks that remind me
				<br>Sadly of years in the lost Nevermore.
				<p>Soft laps the ocean on wave-polish'd boulder,
				<br>Sweet is the sound and familiar to me;
				<br>Here, with her head gently bent to my shoulder,
				<br>Walk'd I with Unda, the Bride of the Sea.
				<p>Bright was the morn of my youth when I met her,
				<br>Sweet as the breeze that blew o'er the brine.
				<br>Swift was I captur'd in Love's strongest fetter,
				<br>Glad to be here, and she glad to be mine.
				<p>Never a question ask'd I where she wander'd,
				<br>Never a question ask'd she of my birth:
				<br>Happy as children, we thought not nor ponder'd,
				<br>Glad of the bounty of ocean and earth.
				<p>Once when the moonlight play'd soft 'mid the billows,
				<br>High on the cliff o'er the waters we stood,
				<br>Bound was her hair with a garland of willows,
				<br>Pluck'd by the fount in the bird-haunted wood.
				<p>Strangely she gaz'd on the surges beneath her,
				<br>Charm'd with the sound or entranc'd by the light:
				<br>Then did the waves a wild aspect bequeath her,
				<br>Stern as the ocean and weird as the night.
				<p>Coldly she left me, astonish'd and weeping,
				<br>Standing alone 'mid the legions she bless'd:
				<br>Down, ever downward, half gliding, half creeping,
				<br>Stole the sweet Unda in oceanward quest.
				<p>Calm grew the sea, and tumultuous beating
				<br>Turn'd to a ripple as Unda the fair
				<br>Trod the wet sands in affectionate greeting,
				<br>Beckon'd to me, and no longer was there!
				<p>Long did I pace by the banks where she vanish'd,
				<br>High climb'd the moon and descended again.
				<br>Grey broke the dawn till the sad night was banish'd,
				<br>Still ach'd my soul with its infinite pain.
				<p>All the wide world have I search'd for my darling;
				<br>Scour'd the far desert and sail'd distant seas.
				<br>Once on the wave while the tempest was snarling,
				<br>Flash'd a fair face that brought quiet and ease.
				<p>Ever in restlessness onward I stumble
				<br>Seeking and pining scarce heeding my way.
				<br>Now have I stray'd where the wide waters rumble,
				<br>Back to the scene of the lost yesterday.
				<p>Lo! the red moon from the ocean's low hazes
				<br>Rises in ominous grandeur to view;
				<br>Strange is its face as my tortur'd eye gazes
				<br>O'er the vast reaches of sparkle and blue.
				<p>Straight from the moon to the shore where I'm sighing
				<br>Grows a bright bridge made of wavelets and beams.
				<br>Frail it may be, yet how simple the trying,
				<br>Wand'ring from earth to the orb of sweet dreams.
				<p>What is yon face in the moonlight appearing;
				<br>Have I at last found the maiden that fled?
				<br>Out on the beam-bridge my footsteps are nearing
				<br>Her whose sweet beckoning hastens my tread.
				<p>Current's surround me, and drowsily swaying,
				<br>Far on the moon-path I seek the sweet face.
				<br>Eagerly, hasting, half panting, half praying,
				<br>Forward I reach for the vision of grace.
				<p>Murmuring waters about me are closing,
				<br>Soft the sweet vision advances to me.
				<br>Done are my trials; my heart is reposing
				<br>Safe with my Unda, the Bride of the Sea.
