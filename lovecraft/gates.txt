                                  Chapter One

   In a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and carpeted with
   Bonkhata rugs of impressive age and workmanship, four men were sitting
   around a document-strewn table. From the far corners, where odd tripods of
   wrought iron were now and then replenished by an incredibly aged Negro in
   somber livery, came the hypnotic fumes of olibanum; while in a deep niche
   on one side there ticked a curious, coffin-shaped clock whose dial bore
   baffling hieroglyphs and whose four hands did not move in consonance with
   any time system known on this planet. It was a singular and disturbing
   room, but well fitted to the business then at hand. For there, in the New
   Orleans home of this continent's greatest mystic, mathematician and
   orientalist, there was being settled at last the estate of a scarcely less
   great mystic, scholar, author and dreamer who had vanished from the face
   of the earth four years before.

   Randolph Carter, who had all his life sought to escape from the tedium and
   limitations of waking reality in the beckoning vistas of dreams and fabled
   avenues of other dimensions, disappeared from the sight of man on the
   seventh of October, 1928, at the age of fifty-four. His career had been a
   strange and lonely one, and there were those who inferred from his curious
   novels many episodes more bizarre than any in his recorded history. His
   association with Harley Warren, the South Carolina mystic whose studies in
   the primal Naacal language of the Himalayan priests had led to such
   outrageous conclusions, had been close. Indeed, it was he who - one
   mist-mad, terrible night in an ancient graveyard - had seen Warren descend
   into a dank and nitrous vault, never to emerge. Carter lived in Boston,
   but it was from the wild, haunted hills behind hoary and witch-accursed
   Arkham that all his forebears had come. And it was amid these ancient,
   cryptically brooding hills that he had ultimately vanished.

   His old servant, Parks - who died early in 1930 - had spoken of the
   strangely aromatic and hideously carven box he had found in the attic, and
   of the indecipherable parchments and queerly figured silver key which that
   box had contained: matters of which Carter had also written to others.
   Carter, he said, had told him that this key had come down from his
   ancestors, and that it would help him to unlock the gates to his lost
   boyhood, and to strange dimensions and fantastic realms which he had
   hitherto visited only in vague, brief, and elusive dreams. Then one day
   Carter took the box and its contents and rode away in his car, never to
   return.

   Later on, people found the car at the side of an old, grass-grown road in
   the hills behind crumbling Arkham - the hills where Carter's forebears had
   once dwelt, and where the ruined cellar of the great Carter homestead
   still gaped to the sky. It was in a grove of tall elms near by that
   another of the Carters had mysteriously vanished in 1781, and not far away
   was the half-rotted cottage where Goody Fowler, the witch, had brewed her
   ominous potions still earlier. The region had been settled in 1692 by
   fugitives from the witchcraft trials in Salem, and even now it bore a name
   for vaguely ominous things scarcely to be envisaged. Edmund Carter had
   fled from the shadow of Gallows Hill just in time, and the tales of his
   sorceries were many. Now, it seemed, his lone descendant had gone
   somewhere to join him!

   In the car they found the hideously carved box of fragrant wood, and the
   parchment which no man could read. The silver key was gone - presumably
   with Carter. Further than that there was no certain clue. Detectives from
   Boston said that the fallen timbers of the old Carter place seemed oddly
   disturbed, and somebody found a handkerchief on the rock-ridged,
   sinisterly wooded slope behind the ruins near the dreaded cave called the
   Snake Den.

   It was then that the country legends about the Snake Den gained a new
   vitality. Farmers whispered of the blasphemous uses to which old Edmund
   Carter the wizard had put that horrible grotto, and added later tales
   about the fondness which Randolph Carter himself hid had for it when a
   boy. In Carter's boyhood the venerable gambrel-roofed homestead was still
   standing and tenanted by his great-uncle Christopher. He had visited there
   often, and had talked singularly about the Snake Den. People remembered
   what he had said about a deep fissure and an unknown inner cave beyond,
   and speculated on the change he had shown after spending one whole
   memorable day in the cavern when he was nine. That was in October, too -
   and ever after that he had seemed to have a uncanny knack at prophesying
   future events.

   It had rained late in the night that Carter vanished, and no one was quite
   able to trace his footprints from the car. Inside the Snake Den all was
   amorphous liquid mud, owing to the copious seepage. Only the ignorant
   rustics whispered about the prints they thought they spied where the great
   elms overhang the road, and on the sinister hillside near the Snake Den,
   where the handkerchief was found. Who could pay attention to whispers that
   spoke of stubby little tracks like those which Randolph Carter's
   square-toed boots made when he was a small boy? It was as crazy a notion
   as that other whisper - that the tracks of old Benijah Corey's peculiar
   heelless boots had met the stubby little tracks in the road. Old Benijah
   had been the Carters' hired man when Randolph was young; but he had died
   thirty years ago.

   It must have been these whispers plus Carter's own statement to Parks and
   others that the queerly arabesqued silver key would help him unlock the
   gates of his lost boyhood - which caused a number of mystical students to
   declare that the missing man had actually doubled back on the trail of
   time and returned through forty-five years to that other October day in
   1883 when he had stayed in the Snake Den as a small boy. When he came out
   that night, they argued, he had somehow made the whole trip to 1928 and
   back; for did he not thereafter know of things which were to happen later?
   And yet he had never spoken of anything to happen after 1928.

   One student - an elderly eccentric of Providence, Rhode Island, who had
   enjoyed a long and close correspondence with Carter - had a still more
   elaborate theory, and believed that Carter had not only returned to
   boyhood, but achieved a further liberation, roving at will through the
   prismatic vistas of boyhood dream. After a strange vision this man
   published a tale of Carter's vanishing in which he hinted that the lost
   one now reigned as king on the opal throne of Ilek-Vad, that fabulous town
   of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea
   wherein the bearded and finny Gniorri build their singular labyrinths.

   It was this old man, Ward Phillips, who pleaded most loudly against the
   apportionment of Carter's estate to his heirs - all distant cousins - on
   the ground that he was still alive in another time-dimension and might
   well return some day. Against him was arrayed the legal talent of one of
   the cousins, Ernest K. Aspinwall of Chicago, a man ten years Carter's
   senior, but keen as a youth in forensic battles. For four years the
   contest had raged, but now the time for apportionment had come, and this
   vast, strange room in New Orleans was to be the scene of the arrangement.

   It was the home of Carter's literary and financial executor - the
   distinguished Creole student of mysteries and Eastern antiquities,
   Etienne-Laurent de Marigny. Carter had met de Marigny during the war, when
   they both served in the French Foreign Legion, and had at once cleaved to
   him because of their similar tastes and outlook. When, on a memorable
   joint furlough, the learned young Creole had taken the wistful Boston
   dreamer to Bayonne, in the south of France, and had shown him certain
   terrible secrets in the nighted and immemorial crypts that burrow beneath
   that brooding, eon-weighted city, the friendship was forever sealed.
   Carter's will had named de Marigny as executor, and now that avid scholar
   was reluctantly presiding over the settlement of the estate. It was sad
   work for him, for like the old Rhode Islander he did not believe that
   Carter was dead. But what weight had the dreams of mystics against the
   harsh wisdom of the world?

   Around the table in that strange room in the old French Quarter sat the
   men who claimed an interest in the proceedings. There had been the usual
   legal advertisements of the conference in papers wherever Carter's heirs
   were thought to live; yet only four now sat listening to the abnormal
   ticking of that coffin-shaped clock which told no earthly time, and to the
   bubbling of the courtyard fountain beyond half-curtained, fan-lighted
   windows. As the hours wore on, the faces of the four were half shrouded in
   the curling fumes from the tripods, which, piled recklessly with fuel,
   seemed to need less and less attention from the silently gliding and
   increasingly nervous old Negro.

   There was Etienne de Marigny himself - slim, dark, handsome, mustached,
   and still young. Aspinwall, representing the heirs, was white-haired,
   apoplectic-faced, side-whiskered, and portly. Phillips, the Providence
   mystic, was lean, gray, long-nosed, clean-shaven, and stoop-shouldered.
   The fourth man was non-committal in age - lean, with a dark, bearded,
   singularly immobile face of very regular contour, bound with the turban of
   a high-caste Brahman and having night-black, burning, almost irisless eyes
   which seemed to gaze out from a vast distance behind the features. He had
   announced himself as the Swami Chandraputra, an adept from Benares, with
   important information to give; and both de Marigny and Phillips - who had
   corresponded with him - had been quick to recognize the genuineness of his
   mystical pretensions. His speech had an oddly forced, hollow, metallic
   quality, as if the use of English taxed his vocal apparatus; yet his
   language was as easy, correct and idiomatic as any native Anglo-Saxon's.
   In general attire he was the normal European civilian, but his loose
   clothes sat peculiarly badly on him, while his bushy black beard, Eastern
   turban, and large, white mittens gave him an air of exotic eccentricity.

   De Marigny, fingering the parchment found in Carter's car, was speaking.

   "No, I have not been able to make anything of the parchment. Mr. Phillips,
   here, also gives it up. Colonel Churchward declares it is not Naacal, and
   it looks nothing at all like the hieroglyphics on that Easter Island
   war-club. The carvings on that box, though, do strangely suggest Easter
   Island images. The nearest thing I can recall to these parchment
   characters - notice how all the letters seem to hang down from horizontal
   word-bar - is the writing in a book poor Harley Warren once had. It came
   from India while Carter and I were visiting him in 1919, and he never
   would tell us anything about it - said it would be better if we didn't
   know, and hinted that it might have come originally from some place other
   than the Earth. He took it with him in December, when he went down into
   the vault in that old graveyard - but neither he nor the book ever came to
   the surface again. Some time ago I sent our friend here - the Swami
   Chandraputra - a memory-sketch of some of those letters, and also a
   photostatic copy of the Carter parchment. He believes he may be able to
   shed light on them after certain references and consultations.

   "But the key - Carter sent me a photograph of that. Its curious arabesques
   were not letters, but seem to have belonged to the same culture-tradition
   as the parchment Carter always spoke of being on the point of solving the
   mystery, though he never gave details. Once he grew almost poetic about
   the whole business. That antique silver key, he said, would unlock the
   successive doors that bar our free march down the mighty corridors of
   space and time to the very Border which no man has crossed since Shaddad
   with his terrific genius built and concealed in the sands of Arabia
   Pettraea the prodigious domes and uncounted minarets of thousand-pillared
   Irem. Half-starved dervishes - wrote Carter - and thirst-crazed nomads
   have returned to tell of that monumental portal, and of the hand that is
   sculptured above the keystone of the arch, but no man has passed and
   retraced his steps to say that his footprints on the garnet-strewn sands
   within bear witness to his visit. The key, he surmised, was that for which
   the cyclopean sculptured hand vainly grasps.

   "Why Carter didn't take the parchment as well as the key, we can not say.
   Perhaps he forgot it - or perhaps he forbore to take it through
   recollection of one who had taken a book of like characters into a vault
   and never returned. Or perhaps it was really immaterial to what he wished
   to do."

   As de Marigny paused, old Mr. Phillips spoke a harsh, shrill voice.

   "We can know of Randolph Carter's wandering only what we dream. I have
   been to many strange places in dreams, and have heard many strange and
   significant things in Ulthar, beyond the River Skai. It does not appear
   that the parchment was needed, for certainly Carter reentered the world of
   his boyhood dreams, and is now a king in Ilek-Vad."

   Mr. Aspinwall grew doubly apoplectic-looking as he sputtered: "Can't
   somebody shut the old fool up? We've had enough of these moonings. The
   problem is to divide the property, and it's about time we got to it."

   For the first time Swami Chandraputra spoke in his queerly alien voice.

   "Gentlemen, there is more to this matter than you think. Mr. Aspinwall
   does not do well to laugh at the evidence of dreams. Mr. Phillips has
   taken an incomplete view - perhaps because he has not dreamed enough. I,
   myself, have done much dreaming. We in India have always done that, just
   as all the Carters seem to have done it. You, Mr. Aspinwall, as a maternal
   cousin, are naturally not a Carter. My own dreams, and certain other
   sources of information, have told me a great deal which you still find
   obscure. For example, Randolph Carter forgot that parchment which he
   couldn't decipher - yet it would have been well for him had he remembered
   to take it. You see, I have really learned pretty much what happened to
   Carter after he left his car with the silver key at sunset on that seventh
   of October, four years ago."

   Aspinwall audibly sneered, but the others sat up with heightened interest.
   The smoke from the tripods increased, and the crazy ticking of that
   coffin-shaped clock seemed to fall into bizarre patterns like the dots and
   dashes of some alien and insoluble telegraph message from outer space. The
   Hindoo leaned back, half closed his eyes, and continued in that oddly
   labored yet idiomatic speech, while before his audience there began to
   float a picture of what had happened to Randolph Carter.

                                  Chapter Two

   The hills beyond Arkham are full of a strange magic - something, perhaps,
   which the old wizard Edmund Carter called down from the stars and up from
   the crypts of nether earth when he fled there from Salem in 1692. As soon
   as Randolph Carter was back among them he knew that he was close to one of
   the gates which a few audacious, abhorred and alien-souled men have
   blasted through titan walls betwixt the world and the outside absolute.
   Here, he felt, and on this day of the year, he could carry out with
   success the message he had deciphered months before from the arabesques of
   that tarnished and incredibly ancient silver key. He knew now how it must
   be rotated, and how it must be held up to the setting sun, and what
   syllables of ceremony must be intoned into the void at the ninth and last
   turning. In a spot as close to a dark polarity and induced gate as this,
   it could not fail in its primary functions Certainly, he would rest that
   night in the lost boyhood for which he had never ceased to mourn.

   He got out of the car with the key in his pocket, walking up-hill deeper
   and deeper into the shadowy core of that brooding, haunted countryside of
   winding road, vine-grown stone wall, black woodland, gnarled, neglected
   orchard, gaping-windowed, deserted farm-house, and nameless nun. At the
   sunset hour, when the distant spires of Kingsport gleamed in the ruddy
   blaze, he took out the key and made the needed turnings and intonations.
   Only later did he realize how soon the ritual had taken effect.

   Then in the deepening twilight he had heard a voice out of the past: Old
   Benijah Corey, his great-uncle's hired man. Had not old Benijah been dead
   for thirty years? Thirty years before when. What was time? Where had he
   been? Why was it strange that Benijah should be calling him on this
   seventh of October 1883? Was he not out later than Aunt Martha had told
   him to stay? What was this key in his blouse pocket, where his little
   telescope - given him by his father on his ninth birthday, two months
   before - ought to be? Had he found it in the attic at home? Would it
   unlock the mystic pylon which his sharp eye had traced amidst the jagged
   rocks at the back of that inner cave behind the Snake Den on the hill?
   That was the place they always coupled with old Edmund Carter the wizard.
   People wouldn't go there, and nobody but him had ever noticed or squirmed
   through the root-choked fissure to that great black inner chamber with the
   pylon. Whose hands had carved that hint of a pylon out of the living rock?
   Old Wizard Edmund's - or others that he had conjured up and commanded?

   That evening little Randolph ate supper with Uncle Chris and Aunt Martha
   in the old gambrel-roofed farm-house.

   Next morning he was up early and out through the twisted-boughed apple
   orchard to the upper timber lot where the mouth of the Snake Den lurked
   black and forbidding amongst grotesque, overnourished oaks. A nameless
   expectancy was upon him, and he did not even notice the loss of his
   handkerchief as he fumbled in his blouse pocket to see if the queer silver
   key was safe. He crawled through the dark orifice with tense, adventurous
   assurance, lighting his way with matches taken from the sitting-room. In
   another moment he had wriggled through the root-choked fissure at the
   farther end, and was in the vast, unknown inner grotto whose ultimate rock
   wall seemed half like a monstrous and consciously shapen pylon. Before
   that dank, dripping wall he stood silent and awestruck, lighting one match
   after another as he gazed. Was that stony bulge above the keystone of the
   imagined arch really a gigantic sculptured hand? Then he drew forth the
   silver key, and made motions and intonations whose source he could only
   dimly remember. Was anything forgotten? He knew only that he wished to
   cross the barrier to the untrammeled land of his dreams and the gulfs
   where all dimensions dissolved in the absolute.

                                 Chapter Three

   What happened then is scarcely to be described in words. It is full of
   those paradoxes, contradictions and anomalies which have no place in
   waking life, but which fill our more fantastic dreams and are taken as
   matters of course till we return to our narrow, rigid, objective world of
   limited causation and tri-dimensional logic. As the Hindoo continued his
   tale, he had difficulty in avoiding what seemed - even more than the
   notion of a man transferred through the years to boyhood - an air of
   trivial, puerile extravagance. Mr. Aspinwall, in disgust, gave an
   apoplectic snort and virtually stopped listening.

   For the rite of the silver key, as practiced by Randolph Carter in that
   black, haunted cave within a cave, did not prove unavailing. From the
   first gesture and syllable an aura of strange, awesome mutation was
   apparent - a sense of incalculable disturbance and confusion in time and
   space, yet one which held no hint of what we recognize as motion and
   duration. Imperceptibly, such things as age and location ceased to have
   any significance whatever. The day before, Randolph Carter had
   miraculously leaped a gulf of years. Now there was no distinction between
   boy and man. There was only the entity Randolph Carter, with a certain
   store of images which had lost all connection with terrestrial scenes and
   circumstances of acquisition. A moment before, there had been an inner
   cave with vague suggestions of a monstrous arch and gigantic sculptured
   hand on the farther wall. Now there was neither cave nor absence of cave;
   neither wall nor absence of wall. There was only a flux of impressions not
   so much visual as cerebral, amidst which the entity that was Randolph
   Carter experienced perceptions or registrations of all that his mind
   revolved on, yet without any clear consciousness of the way in which he
   received them.

   By the time the rite was over, Carter knew that he was in no region whose
   place could be told by Earth's geographers, and in no age whose date
   history could fix; for the nature of what was happening was not wholly
   unfamiliar to him. There were hints of it in the cryptical Pnakotic
   fragments, and a whole chapter in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad
   Arab, Abdul Alhazred, had taken on significance when he had deciphered the
   designs graven on the silver key. A gate had been unlocked - not, indeed,
   the Ultimate Gate, but one leading from Earth and time to that extension
   of Earth which is outside time, and from which in turn the Ultimate Gate
   leads fearsomely and perilously to the last Void which is outside all
   earths, all universes, and all matter.

   There would be a Guide - and a very terrible one; a Guide who had been an
   entity of Earth millions of years before, when man was undreamed of, and
   when forgotten shapes moved on a steaming planet building strange cities
   among whose last, crumbling ruins the first mammals were to play. Carter
   remembered what the monstrous Necronomicon had vaguely and disconcertingly
   adumbrated concerning that Guide:

   "And while there are those," the mad Arab had written, "who have dared to
   seek glimpses beyond the Veil, and to accept HIM as guide, they would have
   been more prudent had they avoided commerce with HIM; for it is written in
   the Book of Thoth how terrific is the price of a single glimpse. Nor may
   those who pass ever return, for in the vastnesses transcending our world
   are shapes of darkness that seize and bind. The Affair that shambleth
   about in the night, the evil that defieth the Elder Sign, the Herd that
   stand watch at the secret portal each tomb is known to have and that
   thrive on that which groweth out of the tenants thereof: - all these
   Blacknesses are lesser than HE WHO guardeth the Gateway: HE WHO will guide
   the rash one beyond all the worlds into the Abyss of unnamable devourers.
   For He is 'UMR AT-TAWIL, the Most Ancient One, which the scribe rendereth
   as THE PROLONGED OF LIFE."

   Memory and imagination shaped dim half-pictures with uncertain outlines
   amidst the seething chaos, but Carter knew that they were of memory and
   imagination only. Yet he felt that it was not chance which built these
   things in his consciousness, but rather some vast reality, ineffable and
   undimensioned, which surrounded him and strove to translate itself into
   the only symbols he was capable of grasping. For no mind of Earth may
   grasp the extensions of shape which interweave in the oblique gulfs
   outside time and the dimensions we know.

   There floated before Carter a cloudy pageantry of shapes and scenes which
   he somehow linked with Earth's primal, eon-forgotten past. Monstrous
   living things moved deliberately through vistas of fantastic handiwork
   that no sane dream ever held, and landscapes bore incredible vegetation
   and cliffs and mountains and masonry of no human pattern. There were
   cities under the sea, and denizens thereof; and towers in great deserts
   where globes and cylinders and nameless winged entities shot off into
   space, or hurtled down out of space. All this Carter grasped, though the
   images bore no fixed relation to one another or to him. He himself had no
   stable form or position, but only such shifting hints of form and position
   as his whirling fancy supplied.

   He had wished to find the enchanted regions of his boyhood dreams, where
   galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran, and
   elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kied, beyond forgotten
   palaces with veined ivory columns that sleep lovely and unbroken under the
   moon. Now, intoxicated with wider visions, he scarcely knew what he
   sought. Thoughts of infinite and blasphemous daring rose in his mind, and
   he knew he would face the dreaded Guide without fear, asking monstrous and
   terrible things of him.

   All at once the pageant of impressions seemed to achieve a vague kind of
   stabilization. There were great masses of towering stone, carven into
   alien and incomprehensible designs and disposed according to the laws of
   some unknown, inverse geometry. Light filtered from a sky of no assignable
   colour in baffling, contradictory directions, and played almost sentiently
   over what seemed to be a curved line of gigantic hieroglyphed pedestals
   more hexagonal than otherwise, and surmounted by cloaked, ill-defined
   shapes.

   There was another shape, too, which occupied no pedestal, but which seemed
   to glide or float over the cloudy, floor-like lower level. It was not
   exactly permanent in outline, but held transient suggestions of something
   remotely preceding or paralleling the human form, though half as large
   again as an ordinary man. It seemed to be heavily cloaked, like the shapes
   on the pedestals, with some neutral-coloured fabric; and Carter could not
   detect any eye-holes through which it might gaze. Probably it did not need
   to gaze, for it seemed to belong to an order of beings far outside the
   merely physical in organization and faculties.

   A moment later Carter knew that this was so, for the Shape had spoken to
   his mind without sound or language. And though the name it uttered was a
   dreaded and terrible one, Randolph Carter did not flinch in fear.

   Instead, he spoke back, equally without sound or language, and made those
   obeisances which the hideous Necronomicon had taught him to make. For this
   shape was nothing less than that which all the world has feared since
   Lomar rose out of the sea, and the Children of the Fire Mist came to Earth
   to teach the Elder Lore to man. It was indeed the frightful Guide and
   Guardian of the Gate - 'UMR AT-TAWIL, the ancient one, which the scribe
   rendereth the PROLONGED OF LIFE.

   The Guide knew, as he knew all things, of Carter's quest and coming, and
   that this seeker of dreams and secrets stood before him unafraid. There
   was no horror or malignity in what he radiated, and Carter wondered for a
   moment whether the mad Arab's terrific blasphemous hints came from envy
   and a baffled wish to do what was now about to be done. Or perhaps the
   Guide reserved his horror and malignity for those who feared. As the
   radiations continued, Carter eventually interpreted them in the form of
   words.

   "I am indeed that Most Ancient One," said the Guide, "of whom you know. We
   have awaited you - the Ancient Ones and I. You are welcome, even though
   long delayed. You have the key, and have unlocked the First Gate. Now the
   Ultimate Gate is ready for your trial. If you fear, you need not advance.
   You may still go back unharmed, the way you came. But if you chose to
   advance --"

   The pause was ominous, but the radiations continued to be friendly. Carter
   hesitated not a moment, for a burning curiosity drove him on.

   "I will advance," he radiated back, "and I accept you as my Guide."

   At this reply the Guide seemed to make a sign by certain motions of his
   robe which may or may not have involved the lifting of an arm or some
   homologous member. A second sign followed, and from his well-learned lore
   Carter knew that he was at last very close to the Ultimate Gate. The light
   now changed to another inexplicable colour, and the shapes on the
   quasi-hexagonal pedestals became more clearly defined. As they sat more
   erect, their outlines became more like those of men, though Carter knew
   that they could not be men. Upon their cloaked heads there now seemed to
   rest tall, uncertainly coloured miters, strangely suggestive of those on
   certain nameless figures chiseled by a forgotten sculptor along the living
   cliffs of a high, forbidden mountain in Tartary; while grasped in certain
   folds of their swathings were long sceptres whose carven heads bodied
   forth a grotesque and archaic mystery.

   Carter guessed what they were and whence they came, and Whom they served;
   and guessed, too, the price of their service. But he was still content,
   for at one mighty venture he was to learn all. Damnation, he reflected, is
   but a word bandied about by those whose blindness leads them to condemn
   all who can see, even with a single eye. He wondered at the vast conceit
   of those who had babbled of the malignant Ancient Ones, as if They could
   pause from their everlasting dreams to wreack a wrath on mankind. As well,
   he might a mammoth pause to visit frantic vengeance on an angleworm. Now
   the whole assemblage on the vaguely hexagonal pillars was greeting him
   with a gesture of those oddly carven sceptres and radiating a message
   which he understood:

   "We salute you, Most Ancient One, and you, Randolph Carter, whose daring
   has made you one of us."

   Carter saw now that one of the pedestals was vacant, and a gesture of the
   Most Ancient One told him it was reserved for him. He saw also another
   pedestal, taller than the rest, and at the center of the oddly curved line
   - neither semicircle nor ellipse, parabola nor hyperbola - which they
   formed, This, he guessed, was the Guide's own throne. Moving and rising in
   a manner hardly definable, Carter took his seat; and as he did so he saw
   that the Guide had seated himself.

   Gradually and mistily it became apparent that the Most Ancient One was
   holding something - some object clutched in the outflung folds of his robe
   as if for the sight, or what answered for sight, of the cloaked
   Companions. It was a large sphere, or apparent sphere, of some obscurely
   iridescent metal, and as the Guide put it forward a low, pervasive
   half-impression of sound began to rise and fall in intervals which seemed
   to be rhythmic even though they followed no rhythm of Earth. There was a
   suggestion of chanting or what human imagination might interpret as
   chanting. Presently the quasi-sphere began to grow luminous, and as it
   gleamed up into a cold, pulsating light of unassignable colour, Carter saw
   that its flickerings conformed to the alien rhythm of the chant. Then all
   the mitered, scepter-bearing Shapes on the pedestals commenced a slight,
   curious swaying in the same inexplicable rhythm, while nimbuses of
   unclassifiable light - resembling that of the quasi-sphere - played around
   their shrouded heads.

   The Hindoo paused in his tale and looked curiously at the tall,
   coffin-shaped clock with the four hands and hieroglyphed dial, whose crazy
   ticking followed no known rhythm of Earth.

   "You, Mr. de Marigny," he suddenly said to his learned host, "do not need
   to be told the particularly alien rhythm to which those cowled Shapes on
   the hexagonal pillars chanted and nodded. You are the only one else - in
   America - who has had a taste of the Outer Extension. That clock - I
   suppose it was sent to you by the Yogi poor Harley Warren used to talk
   about -- the seer who said that he alone of living men had been to
   Yian-Ho, the hidden legacy of eon-old Leng, and had borne certain things
   away from that dreadful and forbidden city. I wonder how many of its
   subtler properties you know? If my dreams and readings be correct, it was
   made by those who knew much of the First Gateway. But let me go on with my
   tale."

   At last, continued the Swami, the swaying and the suggestion of chanting
   ceased, the lambent nimbuses around the now drooping and motionless heads
   faded, while the cloaked shapes slumped curiously on their pedestals. The
   quasi-sphere, however, continued to pulsate with inexplicable light.
   Carter felt that the Ancient Ones were sleeping as they had been when he
   first saw them, and he wondered out of what cosmic dreams his coming had
   aroused them. Slowly there filtered into his mind the truth that this
   strange chanting ritual had been one of instruction, and that the
   Companions had been chanted by the Most Ancient One into a new and
   peculiar kind of sleep in order that their dreams might open the Ultimate
   Gate to which the silver key was a passport. He knew that in the
   profundity of this deep sleep they were contemplating unplumbed vastnesses
   of utter and absolute outsideness, and that they were to accomplish that
   which his presence had demanded.

   The Guide did not share this sleep, but seemed still to be giving
   instructions in some subtle, soundless way. Evidently he was implanting
   images of those things which he wished the Companions to dream: and Carter
   knew that as each of the Ancient Ones pictured the prescribed thought,
   there would be born the nucleus of a manifestation visible to his earthly
   eyes. When the dreams of all the Shapes had achieved a oneness, that
   manifestation would occur, and everything he required be materialized,
   through concentration. He had seen such things on Earth - in India, where
   the combined, projected will of a circle of adepts can make a thought take
   tangible substance, and in hoary Atlaanat, of which few even dare speak.

   Just what the Ultimate Gate was, and how it was to be passed, Carter could
   not be certain; but a feeling of tense expectancy surged over him. He was
   conscious of having a kind of body, and of holding the fateful silver key
   in his hand. The masses of towering stone opposite him seemed to possess
   the evenness of a wall, toward the centre of which his eyes were
   irresistibly drawn. And then suddenly he felt the mental currents of the
   Most Ancient One cease to flow forth.

   For the first time Carter realized how terrific utter silence, mental and
   physical, may be. The earlier moments had never failed to contain some
   perceptible rhythm, if only the faint, cryptical pulse of the Earth's
   dimensional extension, but now the hush of the abyss seemed to fall upon
   everything. Despite his intimations of body, he had no audible breath, and
   the glow of 'Umr at-Tawil's quasi-sphere had grown petrifiedly fixed and
   unpulsating. A potent nimbus, brighter than those which had played round
   the heads of the Shapes, blazed frozenly over the shrouded skull of the
   terrible Guide.

   A dizziness assailed Carter, and his sense of lost orientation waxed a
   thousandfold. The strange lights seemed to hold the quality of the most
   impenetrable blacknesses heaped upon blacknesses while about the Ancient
   Ones, so close on their pseudo-hexagonal thrones, there hovered an air of
   the most stupefying remoteness. Then he felt himself wafted into
   immeasurable depths, with waves of perfumed warmth lapping against his
   face. It was as if he floated in a torrid, rose-tinctured sea; a sea of
   drugged wine whose waves broke foaming against shores of brazen fire. A
   great fear clutched him as he half saw that vast expanse of surging sea
   lapping against its far off coast. But the moment of silence was broken -
   the surgings were speaking to him in a language that was not of physical
   sound or articulate words.

   "The Man of Truth is beyond good and evil," intoned the voice that was not
   a voice. 'The Man of Truth has ridden to All-Is-One. The Man of Truth has
   learned that Illusion is the One Reality, and that Substance is the Great
   Impostor."

   And now, in that rise of masonry to which his eyes had been so
   irresistibly drawn, there appeared the outline of a titanic arch not
   unlike that which he thought he had glimpsed so long ago in that cave
   within a cave, on the far, unreal surface of the three-dimensioned Earth.
   He realized that he had been using the silver key - moving it in accord
   with an unlearned and instinctive ritual closely akin to that which had
   opened the Inner Gate. That rose-drunken sea which lapped his cheeks was,
   he realized, no more or less than the adamantine mass of the solid wall
   yielding before his spell, and the vortex of thought with which the
   Ancient Ones had aided his spell. Still guided by instinct and blind
   determination, he floated forward - and through the Ultimate Gate.

                                  Chapter Four

   Randolph Carter's advance through the cyclopean bulk of masonry was like a
   dizzy precipitation through the measureless gulfs between the stars. From
   a great distance he felt triumphant, godlike surges of deadly sweetness,
   and after that the rustling of great wings, and impressions of sound like
   the chirpings and murmurings of objects unknown on Earth or in the solar
   system. Glancing backward, he saw not one gate alone but a multiplicity of
   gates, at some of which clamoured Forms he strove not to remember.

   And then, suddenly, he felt a greater terror than that which any of the
   Forms could give - a terror from which he could not flee because it was
   connected with himself. Even the First Gateway had taken something of
   stability from him, leaving him uncertain about his bodily form and about
   his relationship to the mistily defined objects around him, but it had not
   disturbed his sense of unity. He had still been Randolph Carter, a fixed
   point in the dimensional seething. Now, beyond the Ultimate Gateway, he
   realized in a moment of consuming fright that he was not one person, but
   many persons.

   He was in many places at the same time. On Earth, on October 7, 1883, a
   little boy named Randolph Carter was leaving the Snake Den in the hushed
   evening light and running down the rocky slope, and through the
   twisted-boughed orchard toward his Uncle Christopher's house in the hills
   beyond Arkham; yet at that same moment, which was also somehow in the
   earthly year of 1928, a vague shadow not less Randolph Carter was sitting
   on a pedestal among the Ancient Ones in Earth's transdimensional
   extension, Here, too, was a third Randolph Carter, in the unknown and
   formless cosmic abyss beyond the Ultimate Gate. And elsewhere, in a chaos
   of scenes whose infinite multiplicity and monstrous diversity brought him
   close to the brink of madness, were a limitless confusion of beings which
   he knew were as much himself as the local manifestation now beyond the
   Ultimate Gate.

   There were Carters in settings belonging to every known and suspected age
   of Earth's history, and to remoter ages of earthly entity transcending
   knowledge, suspicion, and credibility; Carters of forms both human and
   non-human, vertebrate and invertebrate, conscious and mindless, animal and
   vegetable. And more, there were Carters having nothing in common with
   earthly life, but moving outrageously amidst backgrounds of other planets
   and systems and galaxies and cosmic continua; spores of eternal life
   drifting from world to world, universe to universe, yet all equally
   himself. Some of the glimpses recalled dreams - both faint and vivid,
   single and persistent - which he had had through the long years since he
   first began to dream; and a few possessed a haunting, fascinating and
   almost horrible familiarity which no earthly logic could explain.

   Faced with this realization, Randolph Carter reeled in the clutch of
   supreme horror - horror such as had not been hinted even at the climax of
   that hideous night when two had ventured into an ancient and abhorred
   necropolis under a waning moon and only one had emerged. No death, no
   doom, no anguish can arouse the surpassing despair which flows from a loss
   of identity. Merging with nothingness is peaceful oblivion; but to be
   aware of existence and yet to know that one is no longer a definite being
   distinguished from other beings - that one no longer has a self - that is
   the nameless summit of agony and dread.

   He knew that there had been a Randolph Carter of Boston, yet could not be
   sure whether he - the fragment or facet of an entity beyond the Ultimate
   Gate - had been that one or some other. His self had been annihilated; and
   yet he - if indeed there could, in view of that utter nullity of
   individual existence, be such a thing as he - was equally aware of being
   in some inconceivable way a legion of selves. It was as though his body
   had been suddenly transformed into one of those many-limbed and
   many-headed effigies sculptured in Indian temples, and he contemplated the
   aggregation in a bewildered attempt to discern which was the original and
   which the additions - if indeed (supremely monstrous thought!) there were
   any original as distinguished from other embodiments.

   Then, in the midst of these devastating reflections, Carter's
   beyond-the-gate fragment was hurled from what had seemed the nadir of
   horror to black, clutching pits of a horror still more profound. This time
   it was largely external - a force of personality which at once confronted
   and surrounded and pervaded him, and which in addition to its local
   presence, seemed also to be a part of himself, and likewise to be
   co-existent with all time and conterminous with all space. There was no
   visual image, yet the sense of entity and the awful concept of combined
   localism and identity and infinity lent a paralyzing terror beyond
   anything which any Carter-fragment had hitherto deemed capable of
   existing.

   In the face of that awful wonder, the quasi-Carter forgot the horror of
   destroyed individuality. It was an All-in-One and One-in-All of limitless
   being and self - not merely a thing of one space-time continuum, but
   allied to the ultimate animating essence of existence's whole unbounded
   sweep - the last, utter sweep which has no confines and which outreaches
   fancy and mathematics alike. It was perhaps that which certain secret
   cults of Earth had whispered of as Yog-Sothoth, and which has been a deity
   under other names; that which the crustaceans of Yuggoth worship as the
   Beyond-One, and which the vaporous brains of the spiral nebulae know by an
   untranslatable sign - yet in a flash the Carter-facet realized how slight
   and fractional all these conceptions are.

   And now the Being was addressing the Carter-facet in prodigious waves that
   smote and burned and thundered - a concentration of energy that blasted
   its recipient with well-nigh unendurable violence, and that paralleled in
   an unearthly rhythm the curious swaying of the Ancient Ones, and the
   flickering of the monstrous lights, in that baffling region beyond the
   First Gate. It was as though suns and worlds and universes had converged
   upon one point whose very position in space they had conspired to
   annihilate with an impact of resistless fury. But amidst the greater
   terror one lesser terror was diminished; for the searing waves appeared
   somehow to isolate the Beyond-the-Gate Carter from his infinity of
   duplicates - to restore, as it were, a certain amount of the illusion of
   identity. After a time the hearer began to translate the waves into
   speech-forms known to him, and his sense of horror and oppression waned.
   Fright became pure awe, and what had seemed blasphemously abnormal seemed
   now only ineffably majestic.

   "Randolph Carter," it seemed to say, "my manifestations on your planet's
   extension, the Ancient Ones, have sent you as one who would lately have
   returned to small lands of dream which he had lost, yet who with greater
   freedom has risen to greater and nobler desires and curiosities. You
   wished to sail up golden Oukranos, to search out forgotten ivory cities in
   orchid-heavy Kied, and to reign on the opal throne of Ilek-Vad, whose
   fabulous towers and numberless domes rise mighty toward a single red star
   in a firmament alien to your Earth and to all matter. Now, with the
   passing of two Gates, you wish loftier things. You would not flee like a
   child from a scene disliked to a dream beloved, but would plunge like a
   man into that last and inmost of secrets which lies behind all scenes and
   dreams.

   "What you wish, I have found good; and I am ready to grant that which I
   have granted eleven times only to beings of your planet - five times only
   to those you call men, or those resembling them. I am ready to show you
   the Ultimate Mystery, to look on which is to blast a feeble spirit. Yet
   before you gaze full at that last and first of secrets you may still wield
   a free choice, and return if you will through the two Gates with the Veil
   still unrent before our eyes."

                                  Chapter Five

   A sudden shutting-off of the waves left Carter in a chilling and awesome
   silence full of the spirit of desolation. On every hand pressed the
   illimitable vastness of the void; yet the seeker knew that the Being was
   still there. After a moment he thought of words whose mental substance he
   flung into the abyss: "I accept. I will not retreat."

   The waves surged forth again, and Carter knew that the Being had heard.
   And now there poured from that limitless Mind a flood of knowledge and
   explanation which opened new vistas to the seeker, and prepared him for
   such a grasp of the cosmos as he had never hoped to possess. He was told
   how childish and limited is the notion of a tri-dimensional world, and
   what an infinity of directions there are besides the known directions of
   up-down, forward-backward, right-left. He was shown the smallness and
   tinsel emptiness of the little Earth gods, with their petty, human
   interests and connections - their hatreds, rages, loves and vanities;
   their craving for praise and sacrifice, and their demands for faiths
   contrary to reason and nature.

   While most of the impressions translated themselves to Carter as words
   there were others to which other senses gave interpretation. Perhaps with
   eyes and perhaps with imagination he perceived that he was in a region of
   dimensions beyond those conceivable to the eye and brain of man. He saw
   now, in the brooding shadows of that which had been first a vortex of
   power and then an illimitable void, a sweep of creation that dizzied his
   senses. From some inconceivable vantagepoint he looked upon prodigious
   forms whose multiple extensions transcended any conception of being, size
   and boundaries which his mind had hitherto been able to hold, despite a
   lifetime of cryptical study. He began to understand dimly why there could
   exist at the same time the little boy Randolph Carter in the Arkham
   farm-house in 1883, the misty form on the vaguely hexagonal pillar beyond
   the First Gate, the fragment now facing the Presence in the limitless
   abyss, and all the other Carters his fancy or perception envisaged.

   Then the waves increased in strength and sought to improve his
   understanding, reconciling him to the multiform entity of which his
   present fragment was an infinitesimal part. They told him that every
   figure of space is but the result of the intersection by a plane of some
   corresponding figure of one more dimension - as a square is cut from a
   cube, or a circle from a sphere. The cube and sphere, of three dimensions,
   are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions, which men know
   only through guesses and dreams; and these in turn are cut from forms of
   five dimensions, and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of
   archetypal infinity. The world of men and of the gods of men is merely an
   infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal thing - the three-dimensional
   phase of that small wholeness reached by the First Gate, where 'Umr
   at-Tawil dictates dreams to the Ancient Ones. Though men hail it as
   reality, and band thoughts of its many-dimensioned original as unreality,
   it is in truth the very opposite. That which we call substance and reality
   is shadow and illusion, and that which we call shadow and illusion is
   substance and reality.

   Time, the waves went on, is motionless, and without beginning or end. That
   it has motion and is the cause of change is an illusion. Indeed, it is
   itself really an illusion, for except to the narrow sight of beings in
   limited dimensions there are no such things as past, present and future.
   Men think of time only because of what they call change, yet that too is
   illusion. All that was, and is, and is to be, exists simultaneously.

   These revelations came with a god like solemnity which left Carter unable
   to doubt. Even though they lay almost beyond his comprehension, he felt
   that they must be true in the light of that final cosmic reality which
   belies all local perspectives and narrow partial views; and he was
   familiar enough with profound speculations to be free from the bondage of
   local and partial conceptions. Had his whole quest not been based upon a
   faith in the unreality of the local and partial?

   After an impressive pause the waves continued, saying that what the
   denizens of few-dimensioned zones call change is merely a function of
   their consciousness, which views the external world from various cosmic
   angles. As the Shapes produced by the cutting of a cone seem to vary with
   the angles of cutting - being circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola
   according to that angle, yet without any change in the cone itself - so do
   the local aspects of an unchanged - and endless reality seem to change
   with the cosmic angle of regarding. To this variety of angles Of
   consciousness the feeble beings of the inner worlds are slaves, since with
   rare exceptions they can not learn to control them. Only a few students of
   forbidden things have gained inklings of this control, and have thereby
   conquered time and change. But the entities outside the Gates command all
   angles, and view the myriad parts of the cosmos in terms of fragmentary
   change-involving perspective, or of the changeless totality beyond
   perspective, in accordance with their will.

   As the waves paused again, Carter began to comprehend, vaguely and
   terrifiedly, the ultimate background of that riddle of lost individuality
   which had at first so horrified him. His intuition pieced together the
   fragments of revelation, and brought him closer and closer to a grasp of
   the secret. He understood that much of the frightful revelation would have
   come upon him - splitting up his ego amongst myriads of earthly
   counterparts inside the First Gate, had not the magic of 'Umr at-Tawil
   kept it from him in order that he might use the silver key with precision
   for the Ultimate Gate's opening. Anxious for clearer knowledge, he sent
   out waves of thought, asking more of the exact relationship between his
   various facets - the fragment now beyond the Ultimate Gate, the fragment
   still on the quasi-hexagonal pedestal beyond the First Gate, the boy of
   1883, the man of 1928, the various ancestral beings who had formed his
   heritage and the bulwark of his ego, amid the nameless denizens of the
   other eons and other worlds which that first hideous flash ultimate
   perception had identified with him. Slowly the waves of the Being surged
   out in reply, trying to make plain what was almost beyond the reach of an
   earthly mind.

   All descended lines of beings of the finite dimensions, continued the
   waves, and all stages of growth in each one of these beings, are merely
   manifestations of one archetypal and eternal being in the space outside
   dimensions. Each local being - son, father, grandfather, and so on - and
   each stage of individual being - infant, child, boy, man - is merely one
   of the infinite phases of that same archetypal and eternal being, caused
   by a variation in the angle of the consciousness-plane which cuts it.
   Randolph Carter at all ages; Randolph Carter and all his ancestors, both
   human and pre-human, terrestrial and pre-terrestrial; all these were only
   phases of one ultimate, eternal "Carter" outside space and time - phantom
   projections differentiated only by the angle at which the plane of
   consciousness happened to cut the eternal archetype in each case.

   A slight change of angle could turn the student of today into the child of
   yesterday; could turn Randolph Carter into that wizard, Edmund Carter who
   fled from Salem to the hills behind Arkham in 1692, or that Pickman Carter
   who in the year 2169 would use strange means in repelling the Mongol
   hordes from Australia; could turn a human Carter into one of those earlier
   entities which had dwelt in primal Hyperborea and worshipped black,
   plastic Tsathoggua after flying down from Kythamil, the double planet that
   once revolved around Arcturus; could turn a terrestrial Carter to a
   remotely ancestral and doubtfully shaped dweller on Kythamil itself, or a
   still remoter creature of trans-galactic Stronti, or a four-dimensioned
   gaseous consciousness in an older space-time continuum, or a vegetable
   brain of the future on a dark, radioactive comet of inconceivable orbit -
   so on, in endless cosmic cycle.

   The archetype, throbbed the waves, are the people of the Ultimate Abyss -
   formless, ineffable, and guessed at only by rare dreamers on the
   low-dimensioned worlds. Chief among such was this informing Being
   itself... which indeed was Carter's own archetype. The gutless zeal of
   Carter and all his forebears for forbidden cosmic secrets was a natural
   result of derivation from the Supreme Archetype. On every world all great
   wizards, all great thinkers, all great artists, are facets of It.

   Almost stunned with awe, and with a kind of terrifying delight, Randolph
   Carter's consciousness did homage to that transcendent Entity from which
   it was derived. As the waves paused again he pondered in the mighty
   silence, thinking of strange tributes, stranger questions, and still
   stranger requests. Curious concepts flowed conflictingly through a brain
   dazed with unaccustomed vistas and unforeseen disclosures. It occurred to
   him that, if these disclosures were literally true, he might bodily visit
   all those infinitely distant ages and parts of the universe which he had
   hitherto known only in dreams, could he but command the magic to change
   the angle of his consciousness-plane. And did not the silver key supply
   that magic? Had it not first changed him from a man in 1928 to a boy in
   1883, and then to something quite outside time? Oddly, despite his present
   apparent absence of body; he knew that the key was still with him.

   While the silence still lasted, Randolph Carter radiated forth the
   thoughts and questions which assailed him. He knew that in this ultimate
   abyss he was equidistant from every facet of his archetype - human or
   non-human, terrestrial or ertra-terrestrial, galactic or tran-galactic;
   and his curiosity regarding the other phases of his being - especially
   those phases which were farthest from an earthly 1928 in time and space,
   or which had most persistently haunted his dreams throughout life - was at
   fever beat He felt that his archetypal Entity could at will send him
   bodily to any of these phases of bygone and distant life by changing his
   consciousness-plane and despite the marvels he had undergone he burned for
   the further marvel of walking in the flesh through those grotesque and
   incredible scenes which visions of the night had fragmentarily brought
   him.

   Without definite intention be was asking the Presence for access to a dim,
   fantastic world whose five multi-coloured suns, alien constellations,
   dizzily black crags, clawed, tapir-snouted denizens, bizarre metal towers,
   unexplained tunnels, and cryptical floating cylinders had intruded again
   and again upon his slumbers. That world, he felt vaguely, was in all the
   conceivable cosmos the one most freely in touch with others; and he longed
   to explore the vistas whose beginnings he had glimpsed, and to embark
   through space to those still remoter worlds with which the clawed, snouted
   denizens trafficked. There was no time for fear. As at all crises of his
   strange life, sheer cosmic curiosity triumphed over everything else.

   When the waves resumed their awesome pulsing, Carter knew that his
   terrible request was granted. The Being was telling him of the nighted
   gulfs through which he would have to pass of the unknown quintuple star in
   an unsuspected galaxy around which the alien world revolved, and of the
   burrowing inner horrors against which the clawed, snouted race of that
   world perpetually fought. It told him, too, of how the angle of his
   personal consciousness-plane, and the angle of his consciousness-plane
   regarding the space-time elements of the sought-for world, would have to
   be tilted simultaneously in order to restore to that world the
   Carter-facet which had dwelt there.

   The Presence wanted him to be sure of his symbols if he wished ever to
   return from the remote and alien world he had chosen, and he radiated back
   an impatient affirmation; confident that the silver key, which he felt was
   with him and which he knew had tilted both world and personal planes in
   throwing him back to 1883, contained those symbols which were meant. And
   now the Being, grasping his impatience signified its readiness to
   accomplish the monstrous precipitation. The waves abruptly ceased, and
   there supervened a momentary stillness tense with nameless and dreadful
   expectancy.

   Then, without warning, came a whirring and drumming that swelled to a
   terrific thundering. Once again Carter felt himself the focal point of an
   intense concentration of energy which smote and hammered and seared
   unbearably in the now-familiar rhythm of outer space, and which he could
   not classify as either the blasting heat of a blazing star, or the
   all-petrifying cold of the ultimate abyss. Bands and rays of colour
   utterly foreign to any spectrum of our universe played and wove and
   interlaced before him, and he was conscious of a frightful velocity of
   motion. He caught one fleeting glimpse of a figure sitting alone upon a
   cloudy throne more hexagonal than otherwise...

                                  Chapter Six

   As the Hindoo paused in his story he saw that de Marigny and Phillips were
   watching him absorbedly. Aspinwall pretended to ignore the narrative and
   kept his eyes ostentatiously on the papers before him. The alien-rhythmed
   ticking of the coffin-shaped clock took on a new and portentous meaning,
   while the fumes from the choked, neglected tripods wove themselves into
   fantastic and inexplicable shapes, and formed disturbing combinations with
   the grotesque figures of the draft-swayed tapestries. The old Negro who
   had tended them was gone - perhaps some growing tension had frightened him
   out of the house. An almost apologetic hesitancy hampered the speaker as
   he resumed in his oddly labored yet idiomatic voice.

   "You have found these things of the abyss hard to believe," he said, "but
   you will find the tangible and material things ahead still barer. That is
   the way of our minds. Marvels are doubly incredible when brought into
   three dimensions from the vague regions of possible dream. I shall not try
   to tell you much - that would be another and very different story. I will
   tell only what you absolutely have to know."

   Carter, after that final vortex of alien and polychromatic rhythm, had
   found himself in what for a moment he thought was his old insistent dream.
   He was, as many a night before, walking amidst throngs of clawed, snouted
   beings through the streets of a labyrinth of inexplicably fashioned metal
   under a plate of diverse solar colour; and as he looked down he saw that
   his body was like those of the others - rugose, partly squamous, and
   curiously articulated in a fashion mainly insect-like yet not without a
   caricaturish resemblance to the human outline. The silver key was still in
   his grasp, though held by a noxious-looking claw.

   In another moment the dream-sense vanished, and he felt rather as one just
   awakened from a dream. The ultimate abyss - the Being - the entity of
   absurd, outlandish race called Randolph Carter on a world of the future
   not yet born - some of these things were parts of the persistent recurrent
   dreams of the wizard Zkauba on the planet Yaddith. They were too
   persistent - they interfered with his duties in weaving spells to keep the
   frightful Dholes in their burrows, and became mixed up with his
   recollections of the myriad real worlds he had visited in light-beam
   envelopes. And now they had become quasi-real as never before. This heavy,
   material silver key in his right upper claw, exact image of one he had
   dreamt about meant no good. He must rest and reflect, and consult the
   tablets of Nhing for advice on what to do. Climbing a metal wall in a lane
   off the main concourse, he entered his apartment and approached the rack
   of tablets.

   Seven day-fractions later Zkauba squatted on his prism in awe and half
   despair, for the truth had opened up a new and conflicting set of
   memories. Nevermore could he know the peace of being one entity. For all
   time and space he was two: Zkauba the wizard of Yaddith, disgusted with
   the thought of the repellent earth-mammal Carter that he was to be and had
   been, and Randolph Carter, of Boston on the Earth, shivering with fright
   at the clawed, mantel thing which he had once been, and had become again.

   The time units spent on Yaddith, croaked the Swami - whose laboured voice
   was beginning to show signs of fatigue - made a tale in themselves which
   could not be related in brief compass. There were trips to Stronti and
   Mthura and Kath, and other worlds in the twenty-eight galaxies accessible
   to the light-beam envelopes of the creatures of Yaddith, and trips back
   and forth through eons of time with the aid of the silver key and various
   other symbols known to Yaddith's wizards. There were hideous struggles
   with the bleached viscous Dholes in the primal tunnels that honeycombed
   the planet. There were awed sessions in libraries amongst the massed lore
   of ten thousand worlds living and dead. There were tense conferences with
   other minds of Yaddith, including that of the Arch-Ancient Buo. Zkauba
   told no one of what had befallen his personality, but when the Randolph
   Carter facet was uppermost he would study furiously every possible means
   of returning to the Earth and to human form, and would desperately
   practice human speech with the alien throat-organs so ill adapted to it.

   The Carter-facet had soon learned with horror that the silver key was
   unable to effect his return to human form. It was, as he deduced too late
   from things he remembered, things he dreamed, and things he inferred from
   the lore of Yaddith, a product of Hyperborea on Earth; with power over the
   personal consciousness-angles of human beings alone. It could, however,
   change the planetary angle and send the user at will through time in an
   unchanged body. There had been an added spell which gave it limitless
   powers it otherwise lacked; but this, too, was a human discovery -
   peculiar to a spatially unreachable region, and not to be duplicated by
   the wizards of Yaddith. It had been written on the undecipherable
   parchment in the hideously carven box with the silver key, and Carter
   bitterly lamented that he had left it behind. The now inaccessible Being
   of the abyss had warned him to be sure of his symbols, and had doubtless
   thought he lacked nothing.

   As time wore on he strove harder and harder to utilize the monstrous lore
   of Yaddith in finding a way back to the abyss and the omnipotent Entity.
   With his new knowledge be could have done much toward reading the cryptic
   parchment; but that power, under present conditions, was merely ironic.
   There were times, however, when the Zkauba-facet was uppermost and when he
   strove to erase the conflicting Carter-memories which troubled him.

   Thus long spaces of time wore on - ages longer than the brain of man could
   grasp, since the beings of Yaddith die only after prolonged cycles. After
   many hundreds of revolutions the Carter-facet seemed to gain on the
   Zkauba-facet, and would spend vast periods calculating the distance of
   Yaddith in space and time from the human Earth that was to be. The figures
   were staggering eons of light-years beyond counting but the immemorial
   lore of Yaddith fitted Carter to grasp such things. He cultivated the
   power of dreaming himself momentarily Earthward, and learned many things
   about our planet that he had never known before. But he could not dream
   the needed formula on the missing parchment.

   Then at last he conceived a wild plan of escape from Yaddith - which began
   when be found a drug that would keep his Zkauba-facet always dormant, yet
   with out dissolution of the knowledge and memories of Zkauba. He thought
   that his calculations would let him perform a voyage with a light-wave
   envelope such as no being of Yaddidi had ever performed - a bodily voyage
   through nameless eons and across incredible galactic reaches to the solar
   system and the Earth itself.

   Once on Earth, though in the body of a clawed, snouted thing, he might be
   able somehow to find and finish deciphering-the strangely hieroglyphed
   parchment he had left in the car at Arkham; and with its aid - and the
   key's - resume his normal terrestrial semblance.

   He was not blind to the perils of the attempt. He knew that when he had
   brought the planet-angle to the right eon (a thing impossible to do while
   hurtling through space), Yaddith would be a dead world dominated by
   triumphant Dholes, and that his escape in the light-wave envelope would be
   a matter of grave doubt. Likewise was he aware of how he must achieve
   suspended animation, in the manner of an adept, to endure the eon long
   flight through fathomless abysses. He knew, too, that - assuming his
   voyage succeeded - he must immunize himself to the bacterial and other
   earthly conditions hostile to a body from Yaddith. Furthermore, he must
   provide a way of feigning human shape on Earth until he might recover and
   decipher the parchment and resume that shape in truth. Otherwise he would
   probably be discovered and destroyed by the people in horror as a thing
   that should not be. And there must be some gold - luckily obtainable on
   Yaddid - to tide him over that period of quest

   Slowly Carter's plans went forward. He prepared a light-wave envelope of
   abnormal toughness, able to stand both the prodigious time-transition and
   the unexampled flight through space. He tested all his calculations, and
   sent forth his Earthward dreams again and again, bringing them as close as
   possible to 1928. He practiced suspended animation with marvelous success.
   He discovered just the bacterial agent he needed, and worked out the
   varying gravity-stress to which he must become used. He artfully fashioned
   a waxen mask and loose costume enabling him to pass among men as a human
   being of a sort, and devised a doubly potent spell with which to hold back
   the Dholes at the moment of his starting from the dead, black Yaddith of
   the inconceivable future. He took care, too, to assemble a large supply of
   the drugs - unobtainable on Earth - which would keep his Zkauba-facet in
   abeyance till he might shed the Yaddith body, nor did he neglect a small
   store of gold for earthly use.

   The starting-day was a time of doubt and apprehension. Carter climbed up
   to his envelope-platform, on the pretext of sailing for the triple star
   Nython, and crawled into the sheath of shining metal. He had just room to
   perform the ritual of the silver key, and as he did so he slowly started
   the levitation of his envelope. There was an appalling seething and
   darkening of the day, and hideous racking of pain. The cosmos seemed to
   reel irresponsibly, and the other constellations danced in a black sky.

   All at once Carter felt a new equilibrium. The cold of interstellar gulfs
   gnawed at the outside of his envelope, and he could see that he floated
   free in space - the metal building from which he had started having
   decayed years before. Below him the ground was festering with gigantic
   Dholes; and even as he looked, one reared up several hundred feet and
   leveled a bleached, viscous end at him. But his spells were effective, and
   in another moment he was alling away from Yaddith, unharmed.

                                 Chapter Seven

   In that bizarre room in New Orleans, from which the old black servant had
   instinctively fled, the odd voice of Swami Chandraputta grew hoarser
   still.

   "Gentlemen," he continued, "I will not ask you to believe these things
   until I have shown you special proof. Accept it, then, as a myth, when I
   tell you of the thousands of light-years - thousands of years of time, and
   uncounted billions of miles that Randolph Carter hurtled through space as
   a nameless, alien entity in a thin envelope of electron-activated metal.
   He timed his period of suspended animation with utmost care, planning to
   have it end only a few years before the time of landing on the Earth in or
   near 1928.

   "He will never forget that awakening. Remember, gentlemen, that before
   that eon long sleep he had lived consciously for thousands of terrestrial
   years amidst the alien and horrible wonders of Yaddith. There was a
   hideous gnawing of cold, a cessation of menacing dreams, and a glance
   through the eye-plates of the envelope. Stars, clusters, nebulae, on every
   hand - and at last their outline bore some kinship to the constellations
   of Earth that he knew.

   "Some day his descent into the solar system may be told. He saw Kynath and
   Yuggoth on the rim, passed close to Neptune and glimpsed the hellish white
   fungi that spot it, learned an untellable secret from the close glimpsed
   mists of Jupiter, and saw the horror on one of the satellites, and gazed
   at the cyclopean ruins that sprawl over Mars' ruddy disc. When the Earth
   drew near he saw it as a thin crescent which swelled alarmingly in size.
   He slackened speed, though his sensations of homecoming made him wish to
   lose not a moment. I will not try to tell you of these sensations as I
   learned them from Carter.

   "Well, toward the last Carter hovered about in the Earth's upper air
   waiting till daylight came over the Western Hemisphere. He wanted to land
   where he had left - near the Snake Den in the hills behind Arkham. If any
   of you have been away from home long - and I know one of you has - I leave
   it to you how the sight of New England's rolling hills and great elms and
   gnarled orchards and ancient stone walls must have affected him.

   "He came down at dawn in the lower meadow of the old Carter place, and was
   thankful for the silence and solitude. It was autumn, as when he had left,
   and the smell of the hills was balm to his soul. He managed to drag the
   metal envelope up the slope of the timber lot into the Snake Den, though
   it would not go through the weed-choked fissure to the inner cave. It was
   there also that he covered his alien body with the human clothing and
   waxen mask which would be necessary. He kept the envelope here for over a
   year, till certain circumstances made a new hiding-place necessary.

   "He walked to Arkham - incidentally practicing the management of his body
   in human posture and against terrestrial gravity - and his gold changed to
   money at a bank. He also made some inquiries - posing as a foreigner
   ignorant of much English - and found that the year was 1930, only two
   years after the goal he had aimed at.

   "Of course, his position was horrible. Unable to assert his identity,
   forced to live on guard every moment, with certain difficulties regarding
   food, and with a need to conserve the alien drug which kept his
   Zkauba-facet dormant, he felt that he must act as quickly as possible.
   Going to Boston and taking a room in the decaying West End, where he could
   live cheaply and inconspicuously, he at once established inquiries
   concerning Randolph Carter's estate and effects. It was then that he
   learned how anxious Mr. Aspinwall, here, was to have the estate divided,
   and how valiantly Mr. de Marigny and Mr. Phillips strove to keep it
   intact."

   The Hindoo bowed, though no expression crossed his dark, tranquil, and
   thickly bearded face.

   "Indirectly," he continued, "Carter secured a good copy of the missing
   parchment and began working on its deciphering. I am glad to say that I
   was able to help in all this - for he appealed to me quite early, and
   through me came in touch with other mystics throughout the world. I went
   to live with him in Boston - a wretched place in Chambers Street. As for
   the parchment - I am pleased to help Mr. de Marigny in his perplexity. To
   him let me say that the language of those hieroglyphics is not Naacal, but
   R'lyehian, which was brought to Earth by the spawn of Cthulhu countless
   ages ago. It is, of coarse, a translation - there was an Hyperborean
   original millions of years earlier in the primal tongue of Tsath-yo.

   "There was more to decipher than Carter had looked for, but at no time did
   he give up hope. Early this year he made great strides through a book he
   imported from Nepal, and there is no question but that he will win before
   long. Unfortunately, however, one handicap has developed - the exhaustion
   of the alien drug which keeps the Zkauba-facet dormant. This is not,
   however, as great a calamity as was feared. Carter's personality is
   gaining in the body, and when Zkauba comes upper most - for shorter and
   shorter periods, and now only when evoked by some unusual excitement - he
   is generally too dazed to undo any of Carter's work. He can not find the
   metal envelope that would take him hack to Yaddith, for although he almost
   did, once, Carter hid it anew at a time when the Zkanba-facet was wholly
   latent. All the harm he has done is to frighten a few people and create
   certain nightmare rumors among the Poles and Lithuanians of Boston's West
   End. So far, he had never injured the careful disguise prepared by the
   Carter-facet, though he sometimes throws it off so that parts have to be
   replaced. I have seen what lies beneath - and it is not good to see.

   "A month ago Carter saw the advertisement of this meeting, and knew that
   he must act quickly to save his estate. He could not wait to decipher the
   parchment and resume his human form. Consequently he deputed me to act for
   him.

   "Gentlemen, I say to you that Randolph Carter is not dead; that he is
   temporarily in an anomalous condition, but that within two or three months
   at the outside he will be able to appear in proper form and demand the
   custody of his estate. I am prepared to offer proof if necessary.
   Therefore I beg that you will adjourn this meeting for an indefinite
   period."

                                 Chapter Eight

   De Marigny and Phillips stared at the Hindoo as if hypnotized, while
   Aspinwall emitted a series of snorts and bellows. The old attorney's
   disgust had by now surged into open rage and he pounded the table with an
   apoplectically veined fit When he spoke, it was in a kind of bark.

   "How long is this foolery to be borne? I've listened an hour to this
   madman - this faker - and now he has the damned effrontery to say Randolph
   Carter is alive - to ask us to postpone the settlement for no good reason!
   Why don't you throw the scoundrel out, de Marigny? Do you mean to make us
   all the butts of a charlatan or idiot?"

   De Marigny quietly raised his hand and spoke softly.

   "Let us think slowly and dearly. This has been a very singular tale, and
   there are things in it which I, as a mystic not altogether ignorant,
   recognize as far from impossible. Furthermore - since 1930 I have received
   letters from the Swami which tally with his account."

   As he paused, old Mr. Phillips ventured a word.

   "Swami Chandraputra spoke of proofs. I, too, recognize much that is
   significant in this story, and I have myself had many oddly corroborative
   letters from the Swami during the last two years; but some of these
   statements are very extreme. Is there not something tangible which can be
   shown?"

   At last the impassive-faced Swami replied, slowly and hoarsely, and
   drawing an object from the pocket of his loose coat as he spoke.

   "While none of you here has ever seen the silver key itself, Messrs. de
   Marigny and Phillips have seen photographs of it. Does this look familiar
   to you?"

   He fumblingly laid on the table, with his large, white-mittened hand, a
   heavy key of tarnished silver - nearly five inches long, of unknown and
   utterly exotic workmanship, and covered from end to end with hieroglyphs
   of the most bizarre description. De Marigny and Phillips gasped.

   "That's it!" cried de Marigny. "The camera doesn't lie I couldn't be
   mistaken!"

   But Aspinwall had already launched a reply.

   "Fools! What does it prove? If that's really the key that belonged to my
   cousin, it's up to this foreigner - this damned nigger - to explain how he
   got it! Randolph Carter vanished with the key four years ago. How do we
   know he wasn't robbed and murdered? He was half crazy himself, and in
   touch with still crazier people.

   "Look here, you nigger - where did you get that key? Did you kill Randolph
   Carter?"

   The Swami's features, abnormally placid, did not change; but the remote,
   irisless black eyes behind them blazed dangerously. He spoke with great
   difficulty.

   "Please control yourself, Mr. Aspinwall. There is another form of poof
   that I could give, but its effect upon everybody would not be pleasant.
   Let us be reasonable. Here are some papers obviously written since 1930,
   and in the unmistakable style of Randolph Carter."

   He clumsily drew a long envelope from inside his loose coat and handed it
   to the sputtering attorney as de Marigny and Phillips watched with chaotic
   thoughts and a dawning feeling of supernal wonder.

   "Of course the handwriting is almost illegible - but remember that
   Randolph Carter now has no hands well adapted to forming human script."

   Aspinwall looked through the papers hurriedly, and was visibly perplexed,
   but he did not change his demeanor. The room was tense with excitement and
   nameless dread and the alien rhythm of the coffin-shaped clock had an
   utterly diabolic sound to de Marigny and Phillips, though the lawyer
   seemed affected not at all.

   Aspinwall spoke again. "These look like clever forgeries. If they aren't,
   they may mean that Randolph Carter has been brought under the control of
   people with no good purpose. There's only one thing to do - have this
   faker arrested. De Marigny, will you telephone for the police?"

   "Let us wait," answered their host. "I do not think this case calls for
   the police. I have a certain idea. Mr. Aspinwall, this gentleman is a
   mystic of real attainments. He says he is in the confidence of Randolph
   Carter. Will it satisfy you if he can answer certain questions which could
   be answered only by one in such confidence? I know Carter, and can ask
   such questions. Let me get a book which I think will make a good test."

   He turned toward the door to the library, Phillips dazedly following in a
   kind of automatic way. Aspinwall remained where he was, studying closely
   the Hindoo who confronted him with abnormally impassive face. Suddenly, as
   Chandraputra clumsily restored the silver key to his pocket the lawyer
   emitted a guttural shout.

   "Hey, by Heaven I've got it! This rascal is in disguise. I don't believe
   he's an East Indian at all. That face - it isn't a face, but a mask! I
   guess his story put that into my head, but it's true. It never moves, and
   that turban and beard hide the edges. This fellow's a common crook! He
   isn't even a foreigner - I've been watching his language. He's a Yankee of
   some sort. And look at those mittens - he knows his fingerprints could be
   spotted. Damn you, I'll pull that thing off -"

   "Stop!" The hoarse, oddly alien voice of the Swami held a tone beyond all
   mere earthly fright "I told you there was another form of proof which I
   could give if necessary, and I warned you not to provoke me to it. This
   red-faced old meddler is right; I'm not really an East Indian. This face
   is a mask, and what it covers is not human. You others have guessed - I
   felt that minutes ago. It wouldn't be pleasant if I took that mask off -
   let it alone. Ernest, I may as well tell you that I am Randolph Carter."

   No one moved. Aspinwall snorted and made vague motions. De Marigny and
   Phillips, across the room, watched the workings of the red face and
   studied the back of the turbaned figure that confronted him. The clock's
   abnormal ticking was hideous and the tripod fumes and swaying arras danced
   a dance of death. The half-choking lawyer broke the silence.

   "No you don't, you crook - you can't scare me! You've reasons of your own
   for not wanting that mask off. Maybe we'd know who you are. Off with it -
   "

   As he reached forward, the Swami seized his hand with one of his own
   clumsily mittened members, evoking a curious cry of mixed pain and
   surprise. De Marigny started toward the two, but paused confused as the
   pseudo-Hindoo's shout of protest changed to a wholly inexplicable rattling
   and buzzing sound. Aspinwall's red face was furious, and with his free
   hand he made another lunge at his opponent's bushy beard. This time he
   succeeded in getting a hold, and at his frantic tug the whole waxen visage
   came loose from the turban and clung to the lawyer's apoplectic fist.

   As it did so, Aspinwall uttered a frightful gurgling cry, and Phillips and
   de Maigny saw his face convulsed with a wilder, deep and more hideous
   epilepsy of stark panic than ever they had seen on human countenance
   before. The pseudo-Swami had meanwhile released his other hand and was
   standing as if dazed, making buzzing noises of a most abnormal quality.
   Then the turbaned figure slumped oddly into a posture scarcely human, and
   began a curious, fascinated sort of shuffle toward the coffin-shaped clock
   that ticked out its cosmic and abnormal rhythm. His now uncovered face was
   turned away, and de Marigny and Phillips could not see what the lawyer's
   act had disclosure. Then their attention was turned to Aspinwall, who was
   sinking ponderously to the floor. The spell was broken-but when they
   reached the old man he was dead.

   Turning quickly to the shuffling Swami's receding back, de Marigny saw one
   of the great white mittens drop listlessly off a dangling arm. The fumes
   of the olibanum were thick, and all that could be glimpsed of the revealed
   hand was something long and black... Before the Creole could reach the
   retreating figure, old Mr. Phillips laid a hand on his shoulder.

   "Don't!" he whispered, "We don't know what we're up against. That other
   facet, you know - Zkauba, the wizard of Yaddith... "

   The turbaned figure had now reached the abnormal clock, and the watchers
   saw though the dense fumes a blurred black claw fumbling with the tall,
   hieroglyphed door. The fumbling made a queer, clicking sound. Then the
   figure entered the coffin-shaped case and pulled the door shut after it.

   De Marigny could no longer be restrained, but when he reached and opened
   the clock it was empty. The abnormal ticking went on, beating out the
   dark, cosmic rhythm which underlies all mystical gate-openings. On the
   floor the great white mitten, and the dead man with a bearded mask
   clutched in his hand, had nothing further to reveal.

                                   * * * * *

   A year passed, and nothing has been heard of Randolph Carter. His estate
   is still unsettled. The Boston address from which one "Swami Chandraputra"
   sent inquiries to various mystics in 1930-31-32 was indeed tenanted by a
   strange Hindoo, but he left shortly before the date of the New Orleans
   conference and has never been seen since. He was said to be dark,
   expressionless, and bearded, and his landlord thinks the swarthy mask -
   which was duly exhibited - looked very much like him. He was never,
   however, suspected of any connection with the nightmare apparitions
   whispered of by local Slavs. The hills behind Arkham were searched for the
   "metal envelope," but nothing of the sort was ever found. However, a clerk
   in Arkham's First National Bank does recall a queer turbaned man who
   cashed an odd bit of gold bullion in October, 1930.

   De Marigny and Phillips scarcely know what to make of the business. After
   all, what was proved?

   There was a story. There was a key which might have been forged from one
   of the pictures Carter had freely distributed in 1928. There were papers -
   all indecisive. There was a masked stranger, but who now living saw behind
   the mask? Amidst the strain and the olibanum fumes that act of vanishing
   in the clock might easily have been a dual hallucination. Hindoos know
   much of hypnotism. Reason proclaims the "Swami" a criminal with designs on
   Randolph Carter's estate. But the autopsy said that Aspinwall had died of
   shock. Was it rage alone which caused it? And some things in that story...

   In a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and filled with olibanum
   fumes, Etienne Laurent de Marigny often sits listening with vague
   sensations to the abnormal rhythm of that hieroglyphed, coffin-shaped
   clock.
