Halcyon Days

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                    Once more the ancient feast returns,     
                    And the bright hearth domestic burns     
                       With Yuletide's added blaze;          
                    So, too, may all your joys increase      
                    Midst floods of mem'ry, love, and peace, 
                       And dreams of Halcyon days.
