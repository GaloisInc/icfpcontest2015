Where Once Poe Walked

  by H.P. Lovecraft

                Eternal brood the shadows on this ground,        
                Dreaming of centuries that have gone before;     
                Great elms rise solemnly by slab and mound,      
                Arched high above a hidden world of yore.        
                Round all the scene a light of memory plays,     
                And dead leaves whisper of departed days,        
                Longing for sights and sounds that are no more.  
                                                                 
                Lonely and sad, a specter glides along           
                Aisles where of old his living footsteps fell;   
                No common glance discerns him, though his song   
                Peals down through time with a mysterious spell. 
                Only the few who sorcery's secret know,          
                Espy amidst these tombs the shade of Poe.
