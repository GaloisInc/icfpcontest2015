				<p><i>Si veris magna paratur
				<br>Fama bonis, et se successu nuda remoto
				<br>Inspicitur virtus, quicquid laudamus in ullo
				<br>Majorum, ortuna fuit.</i>
				<p align="right"> - Lucan
				<p>Whilst martial echoes o'er the wave resound,
				<br>And Europe's gore incarnadines the ground;
				<br>Today no foreign hero we bemoan,
				<br>But count the glowing virtues of our own!
				<br>illustrious LEE! around whose honour'd name
				<br>Entwines a patriot's and a Christian's fame;
				<br>With whose just praise admiring nations ring,
				<br>And whom repenting foes contritely sing!
				<br>When first our land fraternal fury bore,
				<br>And Sumter's guns alarm'd the anxious shore;
				<br>When Faction's reign ancestral rights o'erthrew,
				<br>And sunder'd States a mutual hatred knew;
				<br>Then clash'd contending chiefs of kindred line,
				<br>In flesh to suffer and in fame to shine.
				<br>But o'er them all, majestic in his might,
				<br>Rose LEE, unrivall'd, to sublimest height:
				<br>With torturing choice defy'd opposing Fate,
				<br>And shunn'd Temptation for his native State!
				<br>Thus Washington his monarch's rule o'erturned
				<br>When young Columbia with rebellion burn'd.
				<br>And what in Washington the world reveres,
				<br>In LEE with equal magnitude appears.
				<br>Our nation's Father, crown'd with vict'ry bays,
				<br>Enjoys a loving land's eternal praise:
				<br>Let, then, our hearts with equal rev'rence greet
				<br>His proud successor, rising o'er defeat!
				<br>Around his greatness pour disheart'ning woes,
				<br>But still he tow'rs above his conquering foes.
				<br>Silence! ye jackal herd that vainly blame
				<br>Th' unspotted leader by a traitor's name.
				<br>If such was LEE, let blushing Justice mourn,
				<br>And trait'rous Liberty endure our scorn!
				<br>As Philopoemen once sublimely strove,
				<br>And earn'd declining Hellas' thankful love;
				<br>So followed LEE the purest patriot's part,
				<br>And wak'd the worship of the grateful heart:
				<br>The South her soul in body'd form discerns;
				<br>The North from LEE a nobler freedom learns!
				<br>Attend! ye sons of Albion's ancient race,
				<br>Whate'er your country, and whate'er your place;
				<br>LEE'S valiant deeds, though dear to Southern song,
				<br>To all our Saxon strain as well belong,
				<br>Courage like his the parent Island won,
				<br>And led an Empire past the setting sun;
				<br>To realms unknown our laws and language bore,
				<br>Rais'd England's banner on the desert shore;
				<br>Crush'd the proud rival, and subdued the sea
				<br>For ages past, and aeons yet to be!
				<br>From Scotia's hilly bounds the paean rolls,
				<br>And Afric's distant Cape great LEE extols;
				<br>The sainted soul and manly mien combine
				<br>To grace Britannia's and Virginia's line
				<br>As dullards now in thoughtless fervour prate
				<br>Of shameful peace, and sing th' unmanly State;
				<br>As churls their piping reprobations shriek,
				<br>And damn the heroes that protect the weak;
				<br>Let LEE'S brave shade the timid throng accost,
				<br>And give them back the manhood they have lost!
				<br>What kindlier spirit, breathing from on high,
				<br>Can teach us how to live and how to die?
