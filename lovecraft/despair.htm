				<p>O'er the midnight moorlands crying,
				<br>Thro' the cypress forests sighing,
				<br>In the night-wind madly flying,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hellish forms with streaming hair;
				<br>In the barren branches creaking,
				<br>By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking,
				<br>Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn'd demons of despair.

				<p>Once, I think I half remember,
				<br>Ere the grey skies of November
				<br>Quench'd my youth's aspiring ember,
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Liv'd there such a thing as bliss;
				<br>Skies that now are dark were beaming,
				<br>Bold and azure, splendid seeming
				<br>Till I learn'd it all was dreaming --
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadly drowsiness of Dis.

				<p>But the stream of Time, swift flowing,
				<br>Brings the torment of half-knowing --
				<br>Dimly rushing, blindly going
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the never-trodden lea;
				<br>And the voyager, repining,
				<br>Sees the wicked death-fires shining,
				<br>Hears the wicked petrel's whining
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;As he helpless drifts to sea.

				<p>Evil wings in ether beating;
				<br>Vultures at the spirit eating;
				<br>Things unseen forever fleeting
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Black against the leering sky.
				<br>Ghastly shades of bygone gladness,
				<br>Clawing fiends of future sadness,
				<br>Mingle in a cloud of madness
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever on the soul to lie.

				<p>Thus the living, lone and sobbing,
				<br>In the throes of anguish throbbing,
				<br>With the loathsome Furies robbing
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Night and noon of peace and rest.
				<br>But beyond the groans and grating
				<br>Of abhorrent Life, is waiting
				<br>Sweet Oblivion, culminating
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;All the years of fruitless quest.
