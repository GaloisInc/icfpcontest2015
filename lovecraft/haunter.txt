                     I have seen the dark universe yawning
                   Where the black planets roll without aim,
                   Where they roll in their horror unheeded,
                      Without knowledge or lustre or name.

   Cautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief that
   Robert Blake was killed by lightning, or by some profound nervous shock
   derived from an electrical discharge. It is true that the window he faced
   was unbroken, but nature has shown herself capable of many freakish
   performances. The expression on his face may easily have arisen from some
   obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw, while the entries in
   his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic imagination aroused by
   certain local superstitions and by certain old matters he had uncovered.
   As for the anomalous conditions at the deserted church of Federal Hill -
   the shrewd analyst is not slow in attributing them to some charlatanry,
   conscious or unconscious, with at least some of which Blake was secretly
   connected.

   For after all, the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the
   field of myth, dream, terror, and superstition, and avid in his quest for
   scenes and effects of a bizarre, spectral sort. His earlier stay in the
   city -a visit to a strange old man as deeply given to occult and forbidden
   lore as he - had ended amidst death and flame, and it must have been some
   morbid instinct which drew him back from his home in Milwaukee. He may
   have known of the old stories despite his statements to the contrary in
   the diary, and his death may have nipped in the bud some stupendous hoax
   destined to have a literary reflection.

   Among those, however, who have examined and correlated all this evidence,
   there remain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories.
   They are inclined to take much of Blake's diary at its face value, and
   point significantly to certain facts such as the undoubted genuineness of
   the old church record, the verified existence of the disliked and
   unorthodox Starry Wisdom sect prior to 1877, the recorded disappearance of
   an inquisitive reporter named Edwin M. Lillibridge in 1893, and - above
   all - the look of monstrous, transfiguring fear on the face of the young
   writer when he died. It was one of these believers who, moved to fanatical
   extremes, threw into the bay the curiously angled stone and its strangely
   adorned metal box found in the old church steeple - the black windowless
   steeple, and not the tower where Blake's diary said those things
   originally were. Though widely censured both officially and unofficially,
   this man - a reputable physician with a taste for odd folklore - averred
   that he had rid the earth of something too dangerous to rest upon it.

   Between these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself.
   The papers have given the tangible details from a sceptical angle, leaving
   for others the drawing of the picture as Robert Blake saw it - or thought
   he saw it - or pretended to see it. Now studying the diary closely,
   dispassionately, and at leisure, let us summarize the dark chain of events
   from the expressed point of view of their chief actor.

   Young Blake returned to Providence in the winter of 1934-5, taking the
   upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off College Street -
   on the crest of the great eastward hill near the Brown University campus
   and behind the marble John Hay Library. It was a cosy and fascinating
   place, in a little garden oasis of village-like antiquity where huge,
   friendly cats sunned themselves atop a convenient shed. The square
   Georgian house had a monitor roof, classic doorway with fan carving,
   small-paned windows, and all the other earmarks of early nineteenth
   century workmanship. Inside were six-panelled doors, wide floor-boards, a
   curving colonial staircase, white Adam-period mantels, and a rear set of
   rooms three steps below the general level.

   Blake's study, a large southwest chamber, overlooked the front garden on
   one side, while its west windows - before one of which he had his desk
   -faced off from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view of the
   lower town's outspread roofs and of the mystical sunsets that flamed
   behind them. On the far horizon were the open countryside's purple slopes.
   Against these, some two miles away, rose the spectral hump of Federal
   Hill, bristling with huddled roofs and steeples whose remote outlines
   wavered mysteriously, taking fantastic forms as the smoke of the city
   swirled up and enmeshed them. Blake had a curious sense that he was
   looking upon some unknown, ethereal world which might or might not vanish
   in dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter it in person.

   Having sent home for most of his books, Blake bought some antique
   furniture suitable for his quarters and settled down to write and paint
   -living alone, and attending to the simple housework himself. His studio
   was in a north attic room, where the panes of the monitor roof furnished
   admirable lighting. During that first winter he produced five of his
   best-known short stories - The Burrower Beneath, The Stairs in the Crypt,
   Shaggai, In the Vale of Pnath, and The Feaster from the Stars - and
   painted seven canvases; studies of nameless, unhuman monsters, and
   profoundly alien, non-terrestrial landscapes.

   At sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the
   outspread west - the dark towers of Memorial Hall just below, the Georgian
   court-house belfry, the lofty pinnacles of the downtown section, and that
   shimmering, spire-crowned mound in the distance whose unknown streets and
   labyrinthine gables so potently provoked his fancy. From his few local
   aquaintances he learned that the far-off slope was a vast Italian quarter,
   though most of the houses were remnant of older Yankee and Irish days. Now
   and then he would train his field-glasses on that spectral, unreachable
   world beyond the curling smoke; picking out individual roofs and chimneys
   and steeples, and speculating upon the bizarre and curious mysteries they
   might house. Even with optical aid Federal Hill seemed somehow alien, half
   fabulous, and linked to the unreal, intangible marvels of Blake's own
   tales and pictures. The feeling would persist long after the hill had
   faded into the violet, lamp-starred twilight, and the court-house
   floodlights and the red Industrial Trust beacon had blazed up to make the
   night grotesque.

   Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church
   most fascinated Blake. It stood out with especial distinctness at certain
   hours of the day, and at sunset the great tower and tapering steeple
   loomed blackly against the flaming sky. It seemed to rest on especially
   high ground; for the grimy fac,ade, and the obliquely seen north side with
   sloping roof and the tops of great pointed windows, rose boldly above the
   tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and chimney-pots. Peculiarly grim and
   austere, it appeared to be built of stone, stained and weathered with the
   smoke and storms of a century and more. The style, so far as the glass
   could show, was that earliest experimental form of Gothic revival which
   preceded the stately Upjohn period and held over some of the outlines and
   proportions of the Georgian age. Perhaps it was reared around 1810 or
   1815.

   As months passed, Blake watched the far-off, forbidding structure with an
   oddly mounting interest. Since the vast windows were never lighted, he
   knew that it must be vacant. The longer he watched, the more his
   imagination worked, till at length he began to fancy curious things. He
   believed that a vague, singular aura of desolation hovered over the place,
   so that even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves. Around
   other towers and belfries his glass would reveal great flocks of birds,
   but here they never rested. At least, that is what he thought and set down
   in his diary. He pointed the place out to several friends, but none of
   them had even been on Federal Hill or possessed the faintest notion of
   what the church was or had been.

   In the spring a deep restlessness gripped Blake. He had begun his
   long-planned novel - based on a supposed survival of the witch-cult in
   Maine - but was strangely unable to make progress with it. More and more
   he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and the
   black, frowning steeple shunned by the birds. When the delicate leaves
   came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new beauty, but
   Blake's restlessness was merely increased. It was then that he first
   thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up that fabulous slope
   into the smoke-wreathed world of dream.

   Late in April, just before the aeon-shadowed Walpurgis time, Blake made
   his first trip into the unknown. Plodding through the endless downtown
   streets and the bleak, decayed squares beyond, he came finally upon the
   ascending avenue of century-worn steps, sagging Doric porches, and
   blear-paned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the long-known,
   unreachable world beyond the mists. There were dingy blue-and-white street
   signs which meant nothing to him, and presently he noted the strange, dark
   faces of the drifting crowds, and the foreign signs over curious shops in
   brown, decade-weathered buildings. Nowhere could he find any of the
   objects he had seen from afar; so that once more he half fancied that the
   Federal Hill of that distant view was a dream-world never to be trod by
   living human feet.

   Now and then a battered church fac,ade or crumbling spire came in sight,
   but never the blackened pile that he sought. When he asked a shopkeeper
   about a great stone church the man smiled and shook his head, though he
   spoke English freely. As Blake climbed higher, the region seemed stranger
   and stranger, with bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys leading
   eternally off to the south. He crossed two or three broad avenues, and
   once thought he glimpsed a familiar tower. Again he asked a merchant about
   the massive church of stone, and this time he could have sworn that the
   plea of ignorance was feigned. The dark man's face had a look of fear
   which he tried to hide, and Blake saw him make a curious sign with his
   right hand.

   Then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left,
   above the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys. Blake
   knew at once what it was, and plunged toward it through the squalid,
   unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue. Twice he lost his way, but he
   somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or housewives who sat on their
   doorsteps, or any of the children who shouted and played in the mud of the
   shadowy lanes.

   At last he saw the tower plain against the southwest, and a huge stone
   bulk rose darkly at the end of an alley. Presently he stood in a
   wind-swept open square, quaintly cobblestoned, with a high bank wall on
   the farther side. This was the end of his quest; for upon the wide,
   iron-railed, weed-grown plateau which the wall supported - a separate,
   lesser world raised fully six feet above the surrounding streets - there
   stood a grim, titan bulk whose identity, despite Blake's new perspective,
   was beyond dispute.

   The vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude. Some of the high
   stone buttresses had fallen, and several delicate finials lay half lost
   among the brown, neglected weeds and grasses. The sooty Gothic windows
   were largely unbroken, though many of the stone mullions were missing.
   Blake wondered how the obscurely painted panes could have survived so
   well, in view of the known habits of small boys the world over. The
   massive doors were intact and tightly closed. Around the top of the bank
   wall, fully enclosing the grounds, was a rusty iron fence whose gate - at
   the head of a flight of steps from the square - was visibly padlocked. The
   path from the gate to the building was completely overgrown. Desolation
   and decay hung like a pall above the place, and in the birdless eaves and
   black, ivyless walls Blake felt a touch of the dimly sinister beyond his
   power to define.

   There were very few people in the square, but Blake saw a policeman at the
   northerly end and approached him with questions about the church. He was a
   great wholesome Irishman, and it seemed odd that he would do little more
   than make the sign of the cross and mutter that people never spoke of that
   building. When Blake pressed him he said very hurriedly that the Italian
   priest warned everybody against it, vowing that a monstrous evil had once
   dwelt there and left its mark. He himself had heard dark whispers of it
   from his father, who recalled certain sounds and rumours from his boyhood.

   There had been a bad sect there in the old days - an outlaw sect that
   called up awful things from some unknown gulf of night. It had taken a
   good priest to exorcise what had come, though there did be those who said
   that merely the light could do it. If Father O'Malley were alive there
   would be many the thing he could tell. But now there was nothing to do but
   let it alone. It hurt nobody now, and those that owned it were dead or far
   away. They had run away like rats after the threatening talk in '77, when
   people began to mind the way folks vanished now and then in the
   neighbourhood. Some day the city would step in and take the property for
   lack of heirs, but little good would come of anybody's touching it. Better
   it be left alone for the years to topple, lest things be stirred that
   ought to rest for ever in their black abyss.

   After the policeman had gone Blake stood staring at the sullen steepled
   pile. It excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to
   others as to him, and he wondered what grain of truth might lie behind the
   old tales the bluecoat had repeated. Probably they were mere legends
   evoked by the evil look of the place, but even so, they were like a
   strange coming to life of one of his own stories.

   The afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds, but seemed
   unable to light up the stained, sooty walls of the old temple that towered
   on its high plateau. It was odd that the green of spring had not touched
   the brown, withered growths in the raised, iron-fenced yard. Blake found
   himself edging nearer the raised area and examining the bank wall and
   rusted fence for possible avenues of ingress. There was a terrible lure
   about the blackened fane which was not to be resisted. The fence had no
   opening near the steps, but round on the north side were some missing
   bars. He could go up the steps and walk round on the narrow coping outside
   the fence till he came to the gap. If the people feared the place so
   wildly, he would encounter no interference.

   He was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone noticed
   him. Then, looking down, he saw the few people in the square edging away
   and making the same sign with their right hands that the shopkeeper in the
   avenue had made. Several windows were slammed down, and a fat woman darted
   into the street and pulled some small children inside a rickety, unpainted
   house. The gap in the fence was very easy to pass through, and before long
   Blake found himself wading amidst the rotting, tangled growths of the
   deserted yard. Here and there the worn stump of a headstone told him that
   there had once been burials in the field; but that, he saw, must have been
   very long ago. The sheer bulk of the church was oppressive now that he was
   close to it, but he conquered his mood and approached to try the three
   great doors in the fac,ade. All were securely locked, so he began a
   circuit of the Cyclopean building in quest of some minor and more
   penetrable opening. Even then he could not be sure that he wished to enter
   that haunt of desertion and shadow, yet the pull of its strangeness
   dragged him on automatically.

   A yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed
   aperture. Peering in, Blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust
   faintly litten by the western sun's filtered rays. Debris, old barrels,
   and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his eye, though over
   everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp outlines. The
   rusted remains of a hot-air furnace showed that the building had been used
   and kept in shape as late as mid-Victorian times.

   Acting almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the
   window and let himself down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strewn
   concrete floor. The vaulted cellar was a vast one, without partitions; and
   in a corner far to the right, amid dense shadows, he saw a black archway
   evidently leading upstairs. He felt a peculiar sense of oppression at
   being actually within the great spectral building, but kept it in check as
   he cautiously scouted about - finding a still-intact barrel amid the dust,
   and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his exit. Then,
   bracing himself, he crossed the wide, cobweb-festooned space toward the
   arch. Half-choked with the omnipresent dust, and covered with ghostly
   gossamer fibres, he reached and began to climb the worn stone steps which
   rose into the darkness. He had no light, but groped carefully with his
   hands. After a sharp turn he felt a closed door ahead, and a little
   fumbling revealed its ancient latch. It opened inward, and beyond it he
   saw a dimly illumined corridor lined with worm-eaten panelling.

   Once on the ground floor, Blake began exploring in a rapid fashion. All
   the inner doors were unlocked, so that he freely passed from room to room.
   The colossal nave was an almost eldritch place with its driffs and
   mountains of dust over box pews, altar, hour-glass pulpit, and
   sounding-board and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among the
   pointed arches of the gallery and entwining the clustered Gothic columns.
   Over all this hushed desolation played a hideous leaden light as the
   declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange, half-blackened
   panes of the great apsidal windows.

   The paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that Blake could
   scarcely decipher what they had represented, but from the little he could
   make out he did not like them. The designs were largely conventional, and
   his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much concerning some of the
   ancient patterns. The few saints depicted bore expressions distinctly open
   to criticism, while one of the windows seemed to show merely a dark space
   with spirals of curious luminosity scattered about in it. Turning away
   from the windows, Blake noticed that the cobwebbed cross above the altar
   was not of the ordinary kind, but resembled the primordial ankh or crux
   ansata of shadowy Egypt.

   In a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and
   ceiling-high shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books. Here for the first
   time he received a positive shock of objective horror, for the titles of
   those books told him much. They were the black, forbidden things which
   most sane people have never even heard of, or have heard of only in
   furtive, timorous whispers; the banned and dreaded repositories of
   equivocal secret and immemorial formulae which have trickled down the
   stream of time from the days of man's youth, and the dim, fabulous days
   before man was. He had himself read many of them - a Latin version of the
   abhorred Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis, the infamous Cultes des
   Goules of Comte d'Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and
   old Ludvig Prinn's hellish De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he
   had known merely by reputation or not at all - the Pnakotic Manuscripts,
   the Book of Dzyan, and a crumbling volume of wholly unidentifiable
   characters yet with certain symbols and diagrams shuddering recognizable
   to the occult student. Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied.
   This place had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider
   than the known universe.

   In the ruined desk was a small leatherbound record-book filled with
   entries in some odd cryptographic medium. The manuscript writing consisted
   of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in
   alchemy, astrology, and other dubious arts - the devices of the sun, moon,
   planets, aspects, and zodiacal signs - here massed in solid pages of text,
   with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to
   some alphabetical letter.

   In the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this volume in
   his coat pocket. Many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him
   unutterably, and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time. He
   wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so long. Was he the
   first to conquer the clutching, pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty
   years protected this deserted place from visitors?

   Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again
   through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had
   seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and
   steeple - objects so long familiar to him at a distance. The ascent was a
   choking experience, for dust lay thick, while the spiders had done their
   worst in this constricted place. The staircase was a spiral with high,
   narrow wooden treads, and now and then Blake passed a clouded window
   looking dizzily out over the city. Though he had seen no ropes below, he
   expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower whose narrow,
   louvre-boarded lancet windows his field-glass had studied so often. Here
   he was doomed to disappointment; for when he attained the top of the
   stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes, and clearly devoted to
   vastly different purposes.

   The room, about fifteen feet square, was faintly lighted by four lancet
   windows, one on each side, which were glazed within their screening of
   decayed louvre-boards. These had been further fitted with tight, opaque
   screens, but the latter were now largely rotted away. In the centre of the
   dust-laden floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar home four feet in
   height and two in average diameter, covered on each side with bizarre,
   crudely incised and wholly unrecognizable hieroglyphs. On this pillar
   rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form; its hinged lid thrown
   back, and its interior holding what looked beneath the decade-deep dust to
   be an egg-shaped or irregularly spherical object some four inches through.
   Around the pillar in a rough circle were seven high-backed Gothic chairs
   still largely intact, while behind them, ranging along the dark-panelled
   walls, were seven colossal images of crumbling, black-painted plaster,
   resembling more than anything else the cryptic carven megaliths of
   mysterious Easter Island. In one corner of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder
   was built into the wall, leading up to the closed trap door of the
   windowless steeple above.

   As Blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd bas-reliefs on
   the strange open box of yellowish metal. Approaching, he tried to clear
   the dust away with his hands and handkerchief, and saw that the figurings
   were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind; depicting entities which,
   though seemingly alive, resembled no known life-form ever evolved on this
   planet. The four-inch seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black,
   red-striated polyhedron with many irregular flat surfaces; either a very
   remarkable crystal of some sort or an artificial object of carved and
   highly polished mineral matter. It did not touch the bottom of the box,
   but was held suspended by means of a metal band around its centre, with
   seven queerly-designed supports extending horizontally to angles of the
   box's inner wall near the top. This stone, once exposed, exerted upon
   Blake an almost alarming fascination. He could scarcely tear his eyes from
   it, and as he looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was
   transparent, with half-formed worlds of wonder within. Into his mind
   floated pictures of alien orbs with great stone towers, and other orbs
   with titan mountains and no mark of life, and still remoter spaces where
   only a stirring in vague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness
   and will.

   When he did look away, it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust
   in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple. Just why it took his
   attention he could not tell, but something in its contours carried a
   message to his unconscious mind. Ploughing toward it, and brushing aside
   the hanging cobwebs as he went, he began to discern something grim about
   it. Hand and handkerchief soon revealed the truth, and Blake gasped with a
   baffling mixture of emotions. It was a human skeleton, and it must have
   been there for a very long time. The clothing was in shreds, but some
   buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man's grey suit. There were other
   bits of evidence - shoes, metal clasps, huge buttons for round cuffs, a
   stickpin of bygone pattern, a reporter's badge with the name of the old
   Providence Telegram, and a crumbling leather pocketbook. Blake examined
   the latter with care, finding within it several bills of antiquated issue,
   a celluloid advertising calendar for 1893, some cards with the name "Edwin
   M. Lillibridge", and a paper covered with pencilled memoranda.

   This paper held much of a puzzling nature, and Blake read it carefully at
   the dim westward window. Its disjointed text included such phrases as the
   following:

     Prof. Enoch Bowen home from Egypt May 1844 - buys old Free-Will Church
     in July - his archaeological work & studies in occult well known.

     Dr Drowne of 4th Baptist warns against Starry Wisdom in sermon 29 Dec.

     1846 - 3 disappearances - first mention of Shining Trapezohedron.

     7 disappearances 1848 - stories of blood sacrifice begin.

     Fr O'Malley tells of devil-worship with box found in great Egyptian
     ruins - says they call up something that can't exist in light. Flees a
     little light, and banished by strong light. Then has to be summoned
     again. Probably got this from deathbed confession of Francis X. Feeney,
     who had joined Starry Wisdom in '49. These people say the Shining
     Trapezohedron shows them heaven & other worlds, & that the Haunter of
     the Dark tells them secrets in some way.

     Ghost stories begin around 1880 - try to ascertain truth of report that
     no human being has entered church since 1877.

     Ask Lanigan for photograph of place taken 1851...

   Restoring the paper to the pocketbook and placing the latter in his coat,
   Blake turned to look down at the skeleton in the dust. The implications of
   the notes were clear, and there could be no doubt but that this man had
   come to the deserted edifice forty-two years before in quest of a
   newspaper sensation which no one else had been bold enough to attempt.
   Perhaps no one else had known of his plan - who could tell? But he had
   never returned to his paper. Had some bravely-suppressed fear risen to
   overcome him and bring on sudden heart-failure? Blake stooped over the
   gleaming bones and noted their peculiar state. Some of them were badly
   scattered, and a few seemed oddly dissolved at the ends. Others were
   strangely yellowed, with vague suggestions of charring. This charring
   extended to some of the fragments of clothing. The skull was in a very
   peculiar state - stained yellow, and with a charred aperture in the top as
   if some powerful acid had eaten through the solid bone. What had happened
   to the skeleton during its four decades of silent entombment here Blake
   could not imagine.

   Before he realized it, he was looking at the stone again, and letting its
   curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind. He saw
   processions of robed, hooded figures whose outlines were not human, and
   looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved, sky-reaching
   monoliths. He saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea, and
   vortices of space where wisps of black mist floated before thin
   shimmerings of cold purple haze. And beyond all else he glimpsed an
   infinite gulf of darkness, where solid and semisolid forms were known only
   by their windy stirrings, and cloudy patterns of force seemed to
   superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and
   arcana of the worlds we know.

   Then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing,
   indeterminate panic fear. Blake choked and turned away from the stone,
   conscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him
   with horrible intentness. He felt entangled with something - something
   which was not in the stone, but which had looked through it at him -
   something which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that was not
   physical sight. Plainly, the place was getting on his nerves - as well it
   might in view of his gruesome find. The light was waning, too, and since
   he had no illuininant with him he knew he would have to be leaving soon.

   It was then, in the gathering twilight, that he thought he saw a faint
   trace of luminosity in the crazily angled stone. He had tried to look away
   from it, but some obscure compulsion drew his eyes hack. Was there a
   subtle phosphorescence of radio-activity about the thing? What was it that
   the dead man 's notes had said concerning a Shining Trapezohedron? What,
   anyway, was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil? What had been done here,
   and what might still be lurking in the bird-shunned shadows? It seemed now
   as if an elusive touch of foetor had arisen somewhere close by, though its
   source was not apparent. Blake seized the cover of the long-open box and
   snapped it down. It moved easily on its alien hinges, and closed
   completely over the unmistakably glowing stone.

   At the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come
   from the steeple's eternal blackness overhead, beyond the trap-door. Rats,
   without question - the only living things to reveal their presence in this
   accursed pile since he had entered it. And yet that stirring in the
   steeple frightened him horribly, so that he plunged almost wildly down the
   spiral stairs, across the ghoulish nave, into the vaulted basement, out
   amidst the gathering dust of the deserted square, and down through the
   teeming, fear-haunted alleys and avenues of Federal Hill towards the sane
   central streets and the home-like brick sidewalks of the college district.

   During the days which followed, Blake told no one of his expedition.
   Instead, he read much in certain books, examined long years of newspaper
   files downtown, and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in that leather
   volume from the cobwebbed vestry room. The cipher, he soon saw, was no
   simple one; and after a long period of endeavour he felt sure that its
   language could not be English, Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, or
   German. Evidently he would have to draw upon the deepest wells of his
   strange erudition.

   Every evening the old impulse to gaze westwards returned, and he saw the
   black steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and
   half-fabulous world. But now it held a fresh note of terror for him. He
   knew the heritage of evil lore it masked, and with the knowledge his
   vision ran riot in queer new ways. The birds of spring were returning, and
   as he watched their sunset flights he fancied they avoided the gaunt, lone
   spire as never before. When a flock of them approached it, he thought,
   they would wheel and scatter in panic confusion - and he could guess at
   the wild twitterings which failed to reach him across the intervening
   miles.

   It was in June that Blake's diary told of his victory over the cryptogram.
   The text was, he found, in the dark Aklo language used by certain cults of
   evil antiquity, and known to him in a halting way through previous
   researches. The diary is strangely reticent about what Blake deciphered,
   but he was patently awed and disconcerted by his results. There are
   references to a Haunter of the Dark awaked by gazing into the Shining
   Trapezohedron, and insane conjectures about the black gulfs of chaos from
   which it was called. The being is spoken of as holding all knowledge, and
   demanding monstrous sacrifices. Some of Blake's entries show fear lest the
   thing, which he seemed to regard as summoned, stalk abroad; though he adds
   that the streetlights form a bulwark which cannot be crossed.

   Of the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window on all
   time and space, and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on
   dark Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to earth. It was
   treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of
   Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and
   peered at aeons later in Lemuria by the first human beings. It crossed
   strange lands and stranger seas, and sank with Atlantis before a Minoan
   fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy merchants from nighted
   Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a temple with a windowless
   crypt, and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all
   monuments and records. Then it slept in the ruins of that evil fane which
   the priests and the new Pharaoh destroyed, till the delver's spade once
   more brought it forth to curse mankind.

   Early in July the newspapers oddly supplement Blake's entries, though in
   so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general attention
   to their contribution. It appears that a new fear had been growing on
   Federal Hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded church. The Italians
   whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings in the dark
   windowless steeple, and called on their priests to banish an entity which
   haunted their dreams. Something, they said, was constantly watching at a
   door to see if it were dark enough to venture forth. Press items mentioned
   the longstanding local superstitions, but failed to shed much light on the
   earlier background of the horror. It was obvious that the young reporters
   of today are no antiquarians. In writing of these things in his diary,
   Blake expresses a curious kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of
   burying the Shining Trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by
   letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire. At the same time,
   however, he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination, and admits a
   morbid longing - pervading even his dreams - to visit the accursed tower
   and gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone.

   Then something in the Journal on the morning of 17 July threw the diarist
   into a veritable fever of horror. It was only a variant of the other
   half-humorous items about the Federal hill restlessness, but to Blake it
   was somehow very terrible indeed. In the night a thunderstorm had put the
   city's lighting-system out of commission for a full hour, and in that
   black interval the Italians had nearly gone mad with fright. Those living
   near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken
   advantage of the street lamps' absence and gone down into the body of the
   church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous, altogether dreadful way.
   Towards the last it had bumped up to the tower, where there were sounds of
   the shattering of glass. It could go wherever the darkness reached, but
   light would always send it fleeing.

   When the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in
   the tower, for even the feeble liglit trickling through the
   grime-blackened, louvre-boarded windows was too much for the thing. It had
   bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in time - for a
   long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss whence the crazy
   stranger had called it. During the dark hour praying crowds had clustered
   round the church in the rain with lighted candles and lamps somehow
   shielded with folded paper and umbrellas - a guard of light to save the
   city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness. Once, those nearest the
   church declared, the outer door had rattled hideously.

   But even this was not the worst. That evening in the Bulletin Blake read
   of what the reporters had found. Aroused at last to the whimsical news
   value of the scare, a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds of
   Italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window after
   trying the doors in vain. They found the dust of the vestibule and of the
   spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way, with pits of rotted cushions
   and satin pew-linings scattered curiously around. There was a bad odour
   everywhere, and here and there were bits of yellow stain and patches of
   what looked like charring. Opening the door to the tower, and pausing a
   moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above, they found the narrow
   spiral stairs wiped roughly clean.

   In the tower itself a similarly half-swept condition existed. They spoke
   of the heptagonal stone pillar, the overturned Gothic chairs, and the
   bizarre plaster images; though strangely enough the metal box and the old
   mutilated skeleton were not mentioned. What disturbed Blake the most -
   except for the hints of stains and charring and bad odours - was the final
   detail that explained the crashing glass. Every one of the tower's lancet
   windows was broken, and two of them had been darkened in a crude and
   hurried way by the stuffing of satin pew-linings and cushion-horsehair
   into the spaces between the slanting exterior louvre-boards. More satin
   fragments and bunches of horsehair lay scattered around the newly swept
   floor, as if someone had been interrupted in the act of restoring the
   tower to the absolute blackness of its tightly curtained days.

   Yellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the
   windowless spire, but when a reporter climbed up, opened the
   horizontally-sliding trap-door and shot a feeble flashlight beam into the
   black and strangely foetid space, he saw nothing but darkness, and a
   heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture. The
   verdict, of course, was charlatanry. Somebody had played a joke on the
   superstitious hill-dwellers, or else some fanatic had striven to bolster
   up their fears for their own supposed good. Or perhaps some of the younger
   and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate hoax on the
   outside world. There was an amusing aftermath when the police sent an
   officer to verify the reports. Three men in succession found ways of
   evading the assignment, and the fourth went very reluctantly and returned
   very soon without adding to the account given by the reporters.

   From this point onwards Blake's diary shows a mounting tide of insidious
   horror and nervous apprehension. He upbraids himself for not doing
   something, and speculates wildly on the consequences of another electrical
   breakdown. It had been verified that on three occasions - during
   thunderstorms - he telephoned the electric light company in a frantic vein
   and asked that desperate precautions against a lapse of power be taken.
   Now and then his entries show concern over the failure of the reporters to
   find the metal box and stone, and the strangely marred old skeleton, when
   they explored the shadowy tower room. He assumed that these things had
   been removed - whither, and by whom or what, he could only guess. But his
   worst fears concerned himself, and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to
   exist between his mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeple -
   that monstrous thing of night which his rashness had called out of the
   ultimate black spaces. He seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will,
   and callers of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his
   desk and stare out of the west window at that far-off spire-bristling
   mound beyond the swirling smoke of the city. His entries dwell
   monotonously on certain terrible dreams, and of a strengthening of the
   unholy rapport in his sleep. There is mention of a night when he awakened
   to find himself fully dressed, outdoors, and headed automatically down
   College Hill towards the west. Again and again he dwells on the fact that
   the thing in the steeple knows where to find him.

   The week following 30 July is recalled as the time of Blake's partial
   breakdown. He did not dress, and ordered all his food by telephone.
   Visitors remarked the cords he kept near his bed, and he said that
   sleep-walking had forced him to bind his ankles every night with knots
   which would probably hold or else waken him with the labour of untying. In
   his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the
   collapse. After retiring on the night of the 30th, he had suddenly found
   himself groping about in an almost black space. All he could see were
   short, faint, horizontal streaks of bluish light, but he could smell an
   overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft, furtive sounds
   above him. Whenever he moved he stumbled over something, and at each noise
   there would come a sort of answering sound from above - a vague stirring,
   mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on wood.

   Once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top,
   whilst later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into
   the wall, and fumbling his uncertain way upwards towards some region of
   intenser stench where a hot, searing blast beat down against him. Before
   his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played, all of them
   dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast, unplumbed abyss of
   night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness. He
   thought of the ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at whose centre sprawls
   the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by his
   flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin
   monotonous piping of a demoniac flute held in nameless paws.

   Then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and
   roused him to the unutterable horror of his position. What it was, he
   never knew - perhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard all
   summer on Federal Hill as the dwellers hail their various patron saints,
   or the saints of their native villages in Italy. In any event he shrieked
   aloud, dropped frantically from the ladder, and stumbled blindly across
   the obstructed floor of the almost lightless chamber that encompassed him.

   He knew instantly where he was, and plunged recklessly down the narrow
   spiral staircase, tripping and bruising himself at every turn. There was a
   nightmare flight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly arches
   readied up to realms of leering shadow, a sightless scramble through a
   littered basement, a climb to regions of air and street lights outside,
   and a mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering gables, across a grim,
   silent city of tall black towers, and up the steep eastward precipice to
   his own ancient door.

   On regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his
   study floor fully dressed. Dirt and cobwebs covered him, and every inch of
   his body seemed sore and bruised. When he faced the mirror he saw that his
   hair was badly scorched while a trace of strange evil odour seemed to
   cling to his upper outer clothing. It was then that his nerves broke down.
   Thereafter, lounging exhaustedly about in a dressing-gown, he did little
   but stare from his west window, shiver at the threat of thunder, and make
   wild entries in his diary.

   The great storm broke just before midnight on 8 August. Lightning struck
   repeatedly in all parts of the city, and two remarkable fireballs were
   reported. The rain was torrential, while a constant fusillade of thunder
   brought sleeplessness to thousands. Blake was utterly frantic in his fear
   for the lighting system, and tried to telephone the company around 1 A.M.
   though by that time service had been temporarily cut off in the interests
   of safety. He recorded everything in his diary - the large, nervous, and
   often undecipherable, hieroglyplis telling their own story of growing
   frenzy and despair, and of entries scrawled blindly in the dark.

   He had to keep the house dark in order to see out of the window, and it
   appears that most of his time was spent at his desk, peering anxiously
   through the rain across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the
   constellation of distant lights marking Federal Hill. Now and then he
   would fumblingly make an entry in his diary, so that detached phrases such
   as "the lights must not go"; "it knows where I am"; "I must destroy it";
   and "it is calling to me, but perhaps it means no injury this time"; are
   found scattered down two of the pages.

   Then the lights went out all over the city. It happened at 2.12 A.M.
   according to power-house records, but Blake's diary gives no indication of
   the time. The entry is merely, "Lights out - God help me." On Federal Hill
   there were watchers as anxious as he, and rain-soaked knots of men paraded
   the square and alleys around the evil church with umbrella-shaded candles,
   electric flashlights, oil lanterns, crucifixes, and obscure charms of the
   many sorts common to southern Italy. They blessed each flash of lightning,
   and made cryptical signs of fear with their right hands when a turn in the
   storm caused the flashes to lessen and finally to cease altogether. A
   rising wind blew out most of the candles, so that the scene grew
   threatening dark. Someone roused Father Merluzzo of Spirito Santo Church,
   and he hastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful
   syllables he could. Of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened
   tower, there could be no doubt whatever.

   For what happened at 2.35 we have the testimony of the priest, a young,
   intelligent, and well-educated person; of Patrolman William J. Monohan of
   the Central Station, an officer of the highest reliability who had paused
   at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd; and of most of the
   seventy-eight men who had gathered around the church's high bank wall -
   especially those in the square where the eastward fac,ade was visible. Of
   course there was nothing which can be proved as being outside the order of
   Nature. The possible causes of such an event are many. No one can speak
   with certainty of the obscure chemical processes arising in a vast,
   ancient, ill-aired, and long-deserted building of heterogeneous contents.
   Mephitic vapours -spontaneous combustion - pressure of gases born of long
   decay - any one of numberless phenomena might be responsible. And then, of
   course, the factor of conscious charlatanry can by no means be excluded.
   The thing was really quite simple in itself, and covered less than three
   minutes of actual time. Father Merluzzo, always a precise man, looked at
   his watch repeatedly.

   It started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the
   black tower. There had for some time been a vague exhalation of strange,
   evil odours from the church, and this had now become emphatic and
   offensive. Then at last there was a sound of splintering wood and a large,
   heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning easterly
   fac,ade. The tower was invisible now that the candles would not burn, but
   as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was the
   smoke-grimed louvre-boarding of that tower's east window.

   Immediately afterwards an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the
   unseen heights, choking and sickening the trembling watchers, and almost
   prostrating those in the square. At the same time the air trembled with a
   vibration as of flapping wings, and a sudden east-blowing wind more
   violent than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the
   dripping umbrellas of the crowd. Nothing definite could be seen in the
   candleless night, though some upward-looking spectators thought they
   glimpsed a great spreading blur of denser blackness against the inky sky -
   something like a formless cloud of smoke that shot with meteorlike speed
   towards the east.

   That was all. The watchers were half numbed with fright, awe, and
   discomfort, and scarcely knew what to do, or whether to do anything at
   all. Not knowing what had happened, they did not relax their vigil; and a
   moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated lightning,
   followed by an earsplitting crash of sound, rent the flooded heavens. Half
   an hour later the rain stopped, and in fifteen minutes more the street
   lights sprang on again, sending the weary, bedraggled watchers relievedly
   back to their homes.

   The next day's papers gave these matters minor mention in connection with
   the general storm reports. It seems that the great lightning flash and
   deafening explosion which followed the Federal Hill occurrence were even
   more tremendous farther east, where a burst of the singular foetor was
   likewise noticed. The phenomenon was most marked over College Hill, where
   the crash awakened all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered
   round of speculations. Of those who were already awake only a few saw the
   anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill, or noticed the
   inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the leaves from the
   trees and blasted the plants in the gardens. It was agreed that the lone,
   sudden lightning-bolt must have struck somewhere in this neighbourhood,
   though no trace of its striking could afterwards be found. A youth in the
   Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass of
   smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst, but his observation
   has not been verified. All of the few observers, however, agree as to the
   violent gust from the west and the flood of intolerable stench which
   preceded the belated stroke, whilst evidence concerning the momentary
   burned odour after the stroke is equally general.

   These points were discussed very carefully because of their probable
   connection with the death of Robert Blake. Students in the Psi Delta
   house, whose upper rear windows looked into Blake's study, noticed the
   blurred white face at the westward window on the morning of the ninth, and
   wondered what was wrong with the expression. When they saw the same face
   in the same position that evening, they felt worried, and watched for the
   lights to come up in his apartment. Later they rang the bell of the
   darkened flat, and finally had a policeman force the door.

   The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when the
   intruders saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark, convulsive
   fright on the twisted features, they turned away in sickened dismay.
   Shortly afterwards the coroner's physician made an examination, and
   despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock, or nervous tension
   induced by electrical discharge, as the cause of death. The hideous
   expression he ignored altogether, deeming it a not improbable result of
   the profound shock as experienced by a person of such abnormal imagination
   and unbalanced emotions. He deduced these latter qualities from the books,
   paintings, and manuscripts found in the apartment, and from the blindly
   scrawled entries in the diary on the desk. Blake had prolonged his
   frenzied jottings to the last, and the broken-pointed pencil was found
   clutched in his spasmodically contracted right hand.

   The entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed, and
   legible only in part. From them certain investigators have drawn
   conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic official verdict, but
   such speculations have little chance for belief among the conservative.
   The case of these imaginative theorists has not been helped by the action
   of superstitious Doctor Dexter, who threw the curious box and angled stone
   - an object certainly self-luminous as seen in the black windowless
   steeple where it was found - into the deepest channel of Narragansett Bay.
   Excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on Blake's part, aggravated
   by knowledge of the evil bygone cult whose startling traces he had
   uncovered, form the dominant interpretation given those final frenzied
   jottings. These are the entries - or all that can be made of them:

     Lights still out - must be five minutes now. Everything depends on
     lightning. Yaddith grant it will keep up!... Some influence seems
     beating through it... Rain and thunder and wind deafen... The thing is
     taking hold of my mind...

     Trouble with memory. I see things I never knew before. Other worlds and
     other galaxies... Dark... The lightning seems dark and the darkness
     seems light...

     It cannot be the real hill and church that I see in the pitch-darkness.
     Must be retinal impression left by flashes. Heaven grant the Italians
     are out with their candles if the lightning stops!

     What am I afraid of? Is it not an avatar of Nyarlathotep, who in antique
     and shadowy Khem even took the form of man? I remember Yuggoth, and more
     distant Shaggai, and the ultimate void of the black planets...

     The long, winging flight through the void... cannot cross the universe
     of light . . . re-created by the thoughts caught in the Shining
     Trapezohedron... send it through the horrible abysses of radiance...

     My name is Blake - Robert Harrison Blake of 620 East Knapp Street,
     Milwaukee, Wisconsin... I am on this planet...

     Azathoth have mercy! - the lightning no longer flashes - horrible - I
     can see everything with a monstrous sense that is not sight - light is
     dark and dark is light... those people on the hill... guard... candles
     and charms... their priests...

     Sense of distance gone -far is near and near is far. No light - no glass
     - see that steeple - that tower - window - can hear - Roderick Usher -
     am mad or going mad - the thing is stirring and fumbling in the tower.

     I am it and it is I - I want to get out... must get out and unify the
     forces... it knows where I am...

     I am Robert Blake, but I see the tower in the dark. There is a monstrous
     odour... senses transfigured... boarding at that tower window cracking
     and giving way... Ia:... ngai... ygg...

     I see it - coming here - hell-wind - titan blue - black wing - Yog
     Sothoth save me - the three-lobed burning eye...
