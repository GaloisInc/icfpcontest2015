                              Dead Passion's Flame            
                                                              
                            A Pome by Blank Frailty           
                                                              
                   Ah, Passion, like a voice - that buds!     
                   With many thorns...that sharply stick:     
                   Recalls to me the longing of our bloods... 
                   And - makes my wearied heart requick! ...  
                                                              
                                    Arcadia                   
                                                              
                                by Head Balledup              
                                                              
                   O give me the life of the Village,         
                       Uninhibited, free, and sweet.          
                   The place where the arts all flourish,     
                       Grove Court and Christopher Street.    
                                                              
                   I am sick of the old conventions,          
                       And critics who will not praise,       
                   So sing ho for the open spaces,            
                       And aesthetes with kindly ways.        
                                                              
                   Here every bard is a genius,               
                       And artists are Raphaels,              
                   And above the roofs of Patchin Place       
                       The Muse of Talent dwells.
