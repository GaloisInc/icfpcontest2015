   A damp gloomy evening in April it was, just after the close of the Great
   War, when Marcia found herself alone with strange thoughts and wishes,
   unheard-of yearnings which floated out of the spacious twentieth-century
   drawing room, up the deeps of the air, and eastward to olive groves in
   distant Arcady which she had seen only in her dreams. She had entered the
   room in abstraction, turned off the glaring chandeliers, and now reclined
   on a soft divan by a solitary lamp which shed over the reading table a
   green glow as soothing as moonlight when it issued through the foliage
   about an antique shrine.

   Attired simply, in a low-cut black evening dress, she appeared outwardly a
   typical product of modern civilization; but tonight she felt the
   immeasurable gulf that separated her soul from all her prosaic
   surroundings. Was it because of the strange home in which she lived, that
   abode of coldness where relations were always strained and the inmates
   scarcely more than strangers? Was it that, or was it some greater and less
   explicable misplacement in time and space, whereby she had been born too
   late, too early, or too far away from the haunts of her spirit ever to
   harmonize with the unbeautiful things of contemporary reality? To dispel
   the mood which was engulfing her more and more deeply each moment, she
   took a magazine from the table and searched for some healing bit of
   poetry. Poetry had always relieved her troubled mind better than anything
   else, though many things in the poetry she had seen detracted from the
   influence. Over parts of even the sublimest verses hung a chill vapor of
   sterile ugliness and restraint, like dust on a window-pane through which
   one views a magnificent sunset.

   Listlessly turning the magazine's pages, as if searching for an elusive
   treasure, she suddenly came upon something which dispelled her languor. An
   observer could have read her thoughts and told that she had discovered
   some image or dream which brought her nearer to her unattained goal than
   any image or dream she had seen before. It was only a bit of vers libre,
   that pitiful compromise of the poet who overleaps prose yet falls short of
   the divine melody of numbers; but it had in it all the unstudied music of
   a bard who lives and feels, who gropes ecstatically for unveiled beauty.
   Devoid of regularity, it yet had the harmony of winged, spontaneous words,
   a harmony missing from the formal, convention-bound verse she had known.
   As she read on, her surroundings gradually faded, and soon there lay about
   her only the mists of dream, the purple, star-strewn mists beyond time,
   where only Gods and dreamers walk.

     Moon over Japan,
     White butterfly moon!
     Where the heavy-lidded Buddhas dream
     To the sound of the cuckoo's call...
     The white wings of moon butterflies
     Flicker down the streets of the city,
     Blushing into silence the useless wicks of sound-lanterns in the hands
   of girls

     Moon over the tropics,
     A white-curved bud
     Opening its petals slowly in the warmth of heaven...

     The air is full of odours
     And languorous warm sounds...
     A flute drones its insect music to the night
     Below the curving moon-petal of the heavens.

     Moon over China,
     Weary moon on the river of the sky,
     The stir of light in the willows is like the flashing of a thousand
   silver minnows
     Through dark shoals;
     The tiles on graves and rotting temples flash like ripples,
     The sky is flecked with clouds like the scales of a dragon.

   Amid the mists of dream the reader cried to the rhythmical stars, of her
   delight at the coming of a new age of song, a rebirth of Pan. Half closing
   her eyes, she repeated words whose melody lay hidden like crystals at the
   bottom of a stream before dawn, hidden but to gleam effulgently at the
   birth of day.

     Moon over Japan,
     White butterfly moon!

     Moon over the tropics,
     A white curved bud
     Opening its petals slowly in the warmth of heaven.
     The air is full of odours
     And languorous warm sounds...

     Moon over China,
     Weary moon on the river of the sky...

   Out of the mists gleamed godlike the torm ot a youth, in winged helmet and
   sandals, caduceus-bearing, and of a beauty like to nothing on earth.
   Before the face of the sleeper he thrice waved the rod which Apollo had
   given him in trade for the nine-corded shell of melody, and upon her brow
   he placed a wreath of myrtle and roses. Then, adoring, Hermes spoke:

   "0 Nymph more fair than the golden-haired sisters of Cyene or the
   sky-inhabiting Atlantides, beloved of Aphrodite and blessed of Pallas,
   thou hast indeed discovered the secret of the Gods, which lieth in beauty
   and song. 0 Prophetess more lovely than the Sybil of Cumae when Apollo
   first knew her, thou has truly spoken of the new age, for even now on
   Maenalus, Pan sighs and stretches in his sleep, wishful to wake and behold
   about him the little rose-crowned fauns and the antique Satyrs. In thy
   yearning hast thou divined what no mortal, saving only a few whom the
   world rejects, remembereth: that the Gods were never dead, but only
   sleeping the sleep and dreaming the dreams of Gods in lotos-filled
   Hesperian gardens beyond the golden sunset. And now draweth nigh the time
   of their awakening, when coldness and ugliness shall perish, and Zeus sit
   once more on Olympus. Already the sea about Paphos trembleth into a foam
   which only ancient skies have looked on before, and at night on Helicon
   the shepherds hear strange murmurings and half-remembered notes. Woods and
   fields are tremulous at twilight with the shimmering of white saltant
   forms, and immemorial Ocean yields up curious sights beneath thin moons.
   The Gods are patient, and have slept long, but neither man nor giant shall
   defy the Gods forever. In Tartarus the Titans writhe and beneath the fiery
   Aetna groan the children of Uranus and Gaea. The day now dawns when man
   must answer for centuries of denial, but in sleeping the Gods have grown
   kind and will not hurl him to the gulf made for deniers of Gods. Instead
   will their vengeance smite the darkness, fallacy and ugliness which have
   turned the mind of man; and under the sway of bearded Saturnus shall
   mortals, once more sacrificing unto him, dwell in beauty and delight. This
   night shalt thou know the favour of the Gods, and behold on Parnassus
   those dreams which the Gods have through ages sent to earth to show that
   they are not dead. For poets are the dreams of Gods, and in each and every
   age someone hath sung unknowingly the message and the promise from the
   lotosgardens beyond the sunset."

   Then in his arms Hermes bore the dreaming maiden through the skies. Gentle
   breezes from the tower of Aiolas wafted them high above warm, scented
   seas, till suddenly they came upon Zeus, holding court upon double-headed
   Parnassus, his golden throne flanked by Apollo and the Muses on the right
   hand, and by ivy-wreathed Dionysus and pleasure-flushed Bacchae on the
   left hand. So much of splendour Marcia had never seen before, either awake
   or in dreams, but its radiance did her no injury, as would have the
   radiance of lofty Olympus; for in this lesser court the Father of Gods had
   tempered his glories for the sight of mortals. Before the laurel-draped
   mouth of the Corycian cave sat in a row six noble forms with the aspect of
   mortals, but the countenances of Gods. These the dreamer recognized from
   images of them which she had beheld, and she knew that they were none else
   than the divine Maeonides, the avernian Dante, the more than mortal
   Shakespeare, the chaos-exploring Milton, the cosmic Goethe and the musalan
   Keats. These were those messengers whom the Gods had sent to tell men that
   Pan had passed not away, but only slept; for it is in poetry that Gods
   speak to men. Then spake the Thunderer:

   "0 Daughter - for, being one of my endless line, thou art indeed my
   daughter - behold upon ivory thrones of honour the august messengers Gods
   have sent down that in the words and writing of men there may be still
   some traces of divine beauty. Other bards have men justly crowned with
   enduring laurels, but these hath Apollo crowned, and these have I set in
   places apart, as mortals who have spoken the language of the Gods. Long
   have we dreamed in lotosgardens beyond the West, and spoken only through
   our dreams; but the time approaches when our voices shall not be silent.
   It is a time of awakening and change. Once more hath Phaeton ridden low,
   searing the fields and drying the streams. In Gaul lone nymphs with
   disordered hair weep beside fountains that are no more, and pine over
   rivers turned red with the blood of mortals. Ares and his train have gone
   forth with the madness of Gods and have returned Deimos and Phobos glutted
   with unnatural delight. Tellus moons with grief, and the faces of men are
   as the faces of Erinyes, even as when Astraea fled to the skies, and the
   waves of our bidding encompassed all the land saving this high peak alone.
   Amidst this chaos, prepared to herald his coming yet to conceal his
   arrival, even now toileth our latest born messenger, in whose dreams are
   all the images which other messengers have dreamed before him. He it is
   that we have chosen to blend into one glorious whole all the beauty that
   the world hath known before, and to write words wherein shall echo all the
   wisdom and the loveliness of the past. He it is who shall proclaim our
   return and sing of the days to come when Fauns and Dryads shall haunt
   their accustomed groves in beauty. Guided was our choice by those who now
   sit before the Corycian grotto on thrones of ivory, and in whose songs
   thou shalt hear notes of sublimity by which years hence thou shalt know
   the greater messenger when he cometh. Attend their voices as one by one
   they sing to thee here. Each note shall thou hear again in the poetry
   which is to come, the poetry which shall bring peace and pleasure to thy
   soul, though search for it through bleak years thou must. Attend with
   diligence, for each chord that vibrates away into hiding shall appear
   again to thee after thou hast returned to earth, as Alpheus, sinking his
   waters into the soul of Hellas, appears as the crystal arethusa in remote
   Sicilia."

   Then arose Homeros, the ancient among bards, who took his lyre and chanted
   his hymn to Aphrodite. No word of Greek did Marcia know, yet did the
   message not fall vainly upon her ears, for in the cryptic rhythm was that
   which spake to all mortals and Gods, and needed no interpreter.

   So too the songs of Dante and Goethe, whose unknown words dave the ether
   with melodies easy to ready and adore. But at last remembered accents
   resounded before the listener. It was the Swan of Avon, once a God among
   men, and still a God among Gods:

     Write, write, that from the bloody course of war,
     My dearest master, your dear son, may hie;
     Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far,
     His name with zealous fervour sanctify.

   Accents still more familiar arose as Milton, blind no more, declaimed
   immortal harmony:

     Or let thy lamp at midnight hour
     Be seen in some high lonely tower,
     Where I might oft outwatch the Bear
     With thrice-great Hermes, or unsphere
     The spirit of Plato, to unfold
     What worlds or what vast regions hold
     The immortal mind, that hath forsook
     Her mansion in this fleshy nook.

       * * * * *

     Sometime let gorgeous tragedy
     In sceptered pall come sweeping by,
     Presenting Thebes, or Pelop's line,
     Or the tale of Troy divine.

     Last of all came the young voice of Keats, closest of all the messengers
   to the beauteous faun-folk:

     Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
     Are sweeter, therefore, yet sweep pipes, play on...

       * * * * *

     When old age shall this generation waste,
     Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
     Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st
     "Beauty is truth -- truth beauty" -- that is all
     Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

   As the singer ceased, there came a sound in the wind blowing from far
   Egypt, where at night Aurora mourns by the Nile for her slain Memnon. To
   the feet of the Thunderer flew the rosy-fingered Goddess and, kneeling,
   cried, "Master, it is time I unlocked the Gates of the East." And Phoebus,
   handing his lyre to Calliope, his bride among the Muses, prepared to
   depart for the jewelled and column-raised Palace of the Sun, where fretted
   the steeds already harnessed to the golden car of Day. So Zeus descended
   from his caryen throne and placed his hand upon the head of Marcia,
   saying:

   "Daughter, the dawn is nigh, and it is well that thou shouldst return
   before the awakening of mortals to thy home. Weep not at the bleakness of
   thy life, for the shadow of false faiths will soon be gone and the Gods
   shall once more walk among men. Search thou unceasingly for our messenger,
   for in him wilt thou find peace and comfort. By his word shall thy steps
   be guided to happiness, and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find
   that which it craveth." As Zeus ceased, the young Hermes gently seized the
   maiden and bore her up toward the fading stars, up and westward over
   unseen seas.

       * * *

   Many years have passed since Marcia dreamt of the Gods and of their
   Parnassus conclave. Tonight she sits in the same spacious drawing-room,
   but she is not alone. Gone is the old spirit of unrest, for beside her is
   one whose name is luminous with celebrity: the young poet of poets at
   whose feet sits all the world. He is reading from a manuscript words which
   none has ever heard before, but which when heard will bring to men the
   dreams and the fancies they lost so many centuries ago, when Pan lay down
   to doze in Arcady, and the great Gods withdrew to sleep in lotos-gardens
   beyond the lands of the Hesperides. In the subtle cadences and hidden
   melodies of the bard the spirit of the maiden had found rest at last, for
   there echo the divinest notes of Thracian Orpheus, notes that moved the
   very rocks and trees by Hebrus' banks. The singer ceases, and with
   eagerness asks a verdict, yet what can Marcia say but that the strain is
   "fit for the Gods"?

   And as she speaks there comes again a vision of Parnassus and the far-off
   sound of a mighty voice saying, "By his word shall thy steps be guided to
   happiness, and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find all that it
   craveth."
