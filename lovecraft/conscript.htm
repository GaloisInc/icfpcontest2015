				<p>I am a peaceful working man,
				<br>I am not wise or strong,
				<br>But I can follow Nature's plan,
				<br>In labour, rest, and song.
				<p>One day the men that rule us all
				<br>Decided we must die,
				<br>Else pride and freedom surely fall
				<br>In the dim bye and bye!
				<p>They told me I must write my name
				<br>Upon a scroll of death;
				<br>That some day I should rise to fame
				<br>By giving up my breath.
				<p>I do not know what I have done
				<br>That I should thus be bound
				<br>To wait for tortures one by one
				<br>And then an unmark'd mound.
				<p>I hate no man, and yet they say
				<br>That I must fight and kill;
				<br>That I must suffer day by day
				<br>To please a master's will.
				<p>I used to have a conscience free,
				<br>But now they bid it rest;
				<br>They've made a number out of me,
				<br>And I must ne'er protest.
				<p>They tell of trenches, long and deep,
				<br>Fill'd with the mangled slain.
				<br>They talk till I can scarcely sleep,
				<br>So reeling is my brain.
				<p>They tell of filth, and blood, and woe;
				<br>Of things beyond belief;
				<br>Of things that make me tremble so
				<br>With mingled fright and grief.
				<p>I do not know what I shall do -
				<br>Is not the law unjust?
				<br>I can't do what they want me to,
				<br>And yet they say I must!
				<p>Each day my doom doth nearer bring;
				<br>Each day the State prepares;
				<br>Sometimes I feel a watching thing
				<br>That stares, and stares, and stares.
				<p>I never seem to sleep - my head
				<br>Whirls in the queerest way.
				<br>Why am I chosen to be dead
				<br>Upon some fateful day?
				<p>Yet hark - some fibre is o'erwrought
				<br>A giddying wine I quaff -
				<br>Things seem so odd, I can do naught
				<br>But laugh, and laugh, and laugh!
