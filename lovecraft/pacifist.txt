Pacifist War Song - 1917

  by H.P. Lovecraft

                   We are the valiant Knights of Peace       
                   Who prattle for the Right:                
                   Our banner is of snowy fleece,            
                   Inscrib'd: "TOO PROUD TO FIGHT!"          
                                                             
                   By sweet Chautauqua's flow'ry banks       
                   We love to sing and play,                 
                   But should we spy a foeman's ranks!       
                   We'd proudly run away!                    
                                                             
                   When Prussian fury sweeps the main        
                   Our freedom to deny;                      
                   Of tyrant laws we ne'er complain;         
                   But gladsomely comply!                    
                                                             
                   We do not fear the submarines             
                   That plough the troubled foam;            
                   We scorn the ugly old machines -          
                   And safely stay at home!                  
                                                             
                   They say our country's close to war       
                   And soon must man the guns;               
                   But we see naught to struggle for -       
                   We love the gentle Huns!                  
                                                             
                   What though their hireling Greaser bands  
                   Invade our southern plains?               
                   We well can spare those boist'rous lands, 
                   Content with what remains!                
                                                             
                   Our fathers were both rude and bold,      
                   And would not live like brothers;         
                   But we are of a finer mould -             
                   We're much more like our mothers!
