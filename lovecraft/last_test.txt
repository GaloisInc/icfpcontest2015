   Few persons know the inside of the Clarendon story, or even that there is
   an inside not reached by the newspapers. It was a San Francisco sensation
   in the days before the fire, both because of the panic and menace that
   kept it company, and because of its close linkage with the governor of the
   state. Governor Dalton, it will be recalled, was Clarendon's best friend,
   and later married his sister. Neither Dalton nor Mrs. Dalton would ever
   discuss the painful affair, but somehow the facts leaked out to a limited
   circle. But for that, and for the years which have give a sort of
   vagueness and impersonality to the actors, one would still pause before
   probing into secrets so strictly guarded at the time.

   The appointment of Dr. Alfred Clarendon as medical director of San Quentin
   Penitentiary in 189- was greeted with the keenest enthusiasm throughout
   California. San Francisco had at last the honour of harbouring one of the
   great biologists and physicians of the period, and solid pathological
   leaders from all over the world might be expected to flock thither to
   study his methods, profit by his advice and researches, and learn how to
   cope with their own local problems. California, almost over night, would
   become a centre of medical scholarship with earthwide influence and
   reputation.

   Governor Dalton, anxious to spread the news in its fullest significance,
   saw to it that the press carried ample and dignified accounts of his new
   appointee. Pictures of Dr. Clarendon and his new home near old Goat Hill,
   sketches of his career and manifold honours, and popular accounts of his
   salient scientific discoveries were all presented in the principal
   California dailies, till the public soon felt a sort of reflected pride in
   the man whose studies of pyemia in India, of the pest in China, and of
   every sort of kindred disorder elsewhere would soon enrich the world of
   medicine with an antitoxin of revolutionary importance - a basic antitoxin
   combating the whole febrile principle at its very source, and ensuring the
   ultimate conquest and extirpation of fever in all its diverse forms.

   Back of the appointments stretched an extended and now wholly unromantic
   history of early friendship, long separation, and dramatically renewed
   acquaintance. James Dalton and the Clarendon family had been friends in
   New York ten years before - friends and more than friends, since the
   doctor's only sister, Georgina, was the sweetheart of Dalton's youth,
   while the doctor himself had been his closest associate and almost his
   protege, in the days of school and college. The father of Alfred and
   Georgina, a Wall Street pirate of the ruthless elder breed, had known
   Dalton's father well; so well, indeed, that he had finally stripped him of
   all he possessed in a memorable afternoon's fight on the stock exchange.
   Dalton Senior, hopeless of recuperation and wishing to give his one adored
   child the benefit of his insurance, had promptly blown out his brains; but
   James had not sought to retaliate. It was, as he viewed it, all in the
   game; and he wished no harm to the father of the girl he meant to marry
   and of the budding young scientist whose admirer and protector he had been
   throughout their years of fellowship and study. Instead, he turned to the
   law, established himself in a small way, and in due course asked 'Old
   Clarendon' for Georgina's hand.

   Old Clarendon had refused very firmly and loudly, vowing that no pauper
   and upstart lawyer was fit to be his son-in-law; and a scene of
   considerable violence had occurred. James, telling the wrinkled freebooter
   at last what he ought to have been told long before, had left the house
   and the city in a high temper; and was embarked within a month upon the
   California life which was to lead him to the governorship through many a
   fight with ring and politician. His farewells to Alfred and Georgina had
   been brief, and he had never known the aftermath of that scene in the
   Clarendon library. Only by a day did he miss the news of Old Clarendon's
   death from apoplexy, and by so missing it, changed the course of his whole
   career. He had not written Georgina in the decade that followed; knowing
   her loyalty to her father, and waiting till his own fortune and position
   might remove all obstacles to the match. Nor had he sent any word to
   Alfred, whose calm indifference in the face of affection and hero-worship
   had always savoured of conscious destiny and the self-sufficiency of
   genius. Secure in the ties of a constancy rare even then, he had worked
   and risen with thoughts only of the future; still a bachelor, and with a
   perfect intuitive faith that Georgina was also waiting.

   In this faith Dalton was not deceived. Wondering perhaps why no message
   ever came, Georgina found no romance save in her dreams and expectations;
   and in the course of time became busy with the new responsibilities
   brought by her brother's rise to greatness. Alfred's growth had not belied
   the promise of his youth, and the slim boy had darted quietly up the steps
   of science with a speed and permanence almost dizzying to contemplate.
   Lean and ascetic, with steel-rimmed pince-nez and pointed brown beard, Dr.
   Alfred Clarendon was an authority at twenty-five and an international
   figure at thirty. Careless of worldly affairs with the negligence of
   genius, he depended vastly on the care and management of his sister, and
   was secretly thankful that her memories of James had kept her from other
   and more tangible alliances.

   Georgina conducted the business and household of the great bacteriologist,
   and was proud of his strides toward the conquest of fever. She bore
   patiently with his eccentricism, calmed his occasional bouts of
   fanaticism, and healed those breaches with his friends which now and then
   resulted from his unconcealed scorn of anything less than a single-minded
   devotion to pure truth and its progress. Clarendon was undeniably
   irritating at times to ordinary folk; for he never tired of depreciating
   the service of the individual as contrasted with the service of mankind as
   a whole, and in censuring men of learning who mingled domestic life or
   outside interests with their pursuit of abstract science. His enemies
   called him a bore; but his admirers, pausing before the white heat of
   ecstasy into which he would work himself, became almost ashamed of ever
   having any standards or aspirations outside the one divine sphere of
   unalloyed knowledge.

   The doctor's travels were extensive and Georgina generally accompanied him
   on the shorter ones. Three times, however, he had taken long, lone jaunts
   to strange and distant places in his studies of exotic fevers and
   half-fabulous plagues; for he knew that it is out of the unknown lands of
   cryptic and immemorial Asia that most of the earth's diseases spring. On
   each of these occasions he had brought back curious mementoes which added
   to the eccentricity of his home, not least among which was the needlessly
   large staff of Thibetan servants picked up somewhere in U-tsang during an
   epidemic of which the world never heard, but amidst which Clarendon had
   discovered and isolated the germ of black fever. These men, taller than
   most Thibetans and clearly belonging to a stock but little investigated in
   the outside world, were of a skeletonic leanness which made one wonder
   whether the doctor had sought to symbolise in them the anatomical models
   of his college years. Their aspect, in the loose black silk robes of Bonpa
   priests which he chose to give them, was grotesque in the highest degree;
   and there was an unsmiling silence and stiffness in their motions which
   enhanced their air of fantasy and gave Georgina a queer, awed feeling of
   having stumbled into the pages of Vathek or the Arabian Nights.

   But queerest of all was the general factotum or clinic-man, whom Clarendon
   addressed as Surama, and whom he had brought back with him after a long
   stay in Northern Africa, during which he had studied certain odd
   intermittent fevers among the mysterious Saharan Tuaregs, whose descent
   from the primal race of lost Atlantis is an old archaeological rumour.
   Surama, a man of great intelligence and seemingly inexhaustible erudition,
   was as morbidly lean as the Thibetan servants; with swarthy,
   parchment-like skin drawn so tightly over his bald pate and hairless face
   that every line of the skull stood out in ghastly prominence - this
   death's-head effect being heightened by lustrelessly burning black eyes
   set with a depth which left to common visibility only a pair of dark,
   vacant sockets. Unlike the ideal subordinate, he seemed despite his
   impassive features to spend no effort in concealing such emotions as he
   possessed. Instead, he carried about an insidious atmosphere of irony or
   amusement, accompanied at certain moments by a deep, guttural chuckle like
   that of a giant turtle which has just torn to pieces some furry animal and
   is ambling away towards the sea. His race appeared to be Caucasian, but
   could not be classified more clearly than that. Some of Clarendon's
   friends thought he looked like a high-caste Hindoo notwithstanding his
   accentless speech, while many agreed with Georgina - who disliked him -
   when she gave her opinion that a Pharaoh's mummy, if miraculously brought
   to life, would form a very apt twin for this sardonic skeleton.

   Dalton, absorbed in his uphill political battles and isolated from Eastern
   interests through the peculiar self-sufficiency of the old West, had not
   followed the meteoric rise of his former comrade; Clarendon had actually
   heard nothing of one so far outside his chosen world of science as the
   governor. Being of independent and even of abundant means, the Clarendons
   had for many years stuck to their old Manhattan mansion in East Nineteenth
   Street, whose ghosts must have looked sorely askance at the bizarrerie of
   Surama and the Thibetans. Then, through the doctor's wish to transfer his
   base of medical observation, the great change had suddenly come, and they
   had crossed the continent to take up a secluded life in San Francisco;
   buying the gloomy old Bannister place near Goat Hill, overlooking the bay,
   and establishing their strange household in a rambling, French-roofed
   relic of mid-Victorian design and gold-rush parvenu display, set amidst
   high-walled grounds in a region still half suburban.

   Dr. Clarendon, though better satisfied than in New York, still felt
   cramped for lack of opportunities to apply and test his pathological
   theories. Unworldly as he was, he had never thought of using his
   reputation as an influence to gain public appointment; though more and
   more he realised that only the medical directorship of a government or a
   charitable institution - a prison, almshouse, or hospital - would give him
   a field of sufficient width to complete his researches and make his
   discoveries of the greatest use to humanity and science at large.

   Then he had run into James Dalton by sheer accident one afternoon in
   Market Street as the governor was swinging out of the Royal Hotel.
   Georgina had been with him, and an almost instant recognition had
   heightened the drama of the reunion. Mutual ignorance of one another's
   progress had bred long explanation and histories, and Clarendon was
   pleased to find that he had so important an official for a friend. Dalton
   and Georgina, exchanging many a glance, felt more than a trace of their
   youthful tenderness; and a friendship was then and there revived which led
   to frequent calls and a fuller and fuller exchange of confidences.

   James Dalton learned of his old protege's need for political appointment,
   and sought, true to his protective role of school and college days, to
   devise some means of giving 'Little Alf' the needed position and scope. He
   had, it is true, wide appointive powers; but the legislature's constant
   attacks and encroachments forced him to exercise these with the utmost
   discretion. At length, however, scarcely three months after the sudden
   reunion, the foremost institutional medical office in the state fell
   vacant. Weighing all the elements with care, and conscious that his
   friend's achievements and reputation would justify the most substantial
   rewards, the governor felt at last able to act. Formalities were few, and
   on the eighth of November, 189-, Dr. Alfred Clarendon became medical
   director of the California State Penitentiary at San Quentin.

                                      II.

   In scarcely more than a month the hopes of Dr. Clarendon's admirers were
   amply fulfilled. Sweeping changes in methods brought to the prison's
   medical routine an efficiency never before dreamed of; and though the
   subordinates were naturally not without jealousy, they were obliged to
   admit the magical results of a really great man's superintendence. Then
   came a time where mere appreciation might well have grown to devour
   thankfulness at a providential conjunction of time, place, and man; for
   one morning Dr Jones came to his new chief with a grave face to announce
   his discovery of a case which he could not but identify as that selfsame
   black fever whose germ Clarendon had found and classified.

   Dr. Clarendon shewed no surprise, but kept on at the writing before him.

   "I know," he said evenly; "I came across that case yesterday. I'm glad you
   recognised it. Put the man in a separate ward, though I don't believe this
   fever is contagious."

   Dr. Jones, with his own opinion of the malady's contagiousness, was glad
   of this deference to caution; and hastened to execute the order. Upon his
   return, Clarendon rose to leave, declaring that he would himself take
   charge of the case alone. Disappointed in his wish to study the great
   man's methods and technique, the junior physician watched his chief stride
   away toward the lone ward where he had placed the patient, more critical
   of the new regime than at any time since admiration had displaced his
   first jealous pangs.

   Reaching the ward, Clarendon entered hastily, glancing at the bed and
   stepping back to see how far Dr. Jones's obvious curiosity might have led
   him. Then, finding the corridor still vacant, he shut the door and turned
   to examine the sufferer. The man was a convict of a peculiarly repulsive
   type, and seemed to be racked by the keenest throes of agony. His features
   were frightfully contracted, and his knees drawn sharply up in the mute
   desperation of the stricken. Clarendon studied him closely, raising his
   tightly shut eyelids, took his pulse and temperature, and finally
   dissolving a tablet in water, forced the solution between the sufferer's
   lips. Before long the height of the attack abated, as shewn by the
   relaxing body and returning normality of expression, and the patient began
   to breathe more easily. Then, by a soft rubbing of the ears, the doctor
   caused the man to open his eyes. There was life in them, for they moved
   from side to side, though they lacked the fine fire which we are wont to
   deem the image of the soul. Clarendon smiled as he surveyed the peace his
   help had brought, feeling behind him the power of an all-capable science.
   He had long known of this case, and had snatched the victim from death
   with the work of a moment. Another hour and this man would have gone - yet
   Jones had seen the symptoms for days before discovering them, and having
   discovered them, did not know what to do.

   Man's conquest of disease, however, cannot be perfect. Clarendon, assuring
   the dubious trusty-nurses that the fever was not contagious, had had the
   patient bathed, sponged in alcohol, and put to bed; but was told the next
   morning that the case was lost. The man had died after midnight in the
   most intense agony, and with such cries and distortions of face that the
   nurses were driven almost to panic. The doctor took this news with his
   usual calm, whatever his scientific feelings may have been, and ordered
   the burial of the patient in quicklime. Then, with a philosophic shrug of
   the shoulders, he made the final rounds of the penitentiary.

   Two days later the prison was hit again. Three men came down at once this
   time, and there was no concealing the fact that a black fever epidemic was
   under way. Clarendon, having adhered so firmly to this theory of
   non-contagiousness, suffered a distinct loss of prestige, and was
   handicapped by the refusal of the trusty-nurses to attend the patients.
   Theirs was not the soul-free devotion of those who sacrifice themselves to
   science and humanity. They were convicts, serving only because of the
   privileges they could not otherwise buy, and when the price became too
   great they preferred to resign the privileges.

   But the doctor was still master of the situation. Consulting with the
   warden and sending urgent messages to his friend the governor, he saw to
   it that special rewards in cash and in reduced terms were offered to the
   convicts for the dangerous nursing service; and by this succeeded in
   getting a very fair quota of volunteers. He was steeled for action now,
   and nothing could shake his poise and determination. Additional cases
   brought only a curt nod, and he seemed a stranger to fatigue as he
   hastened from bedside to bedside all over the vast stone home of sadness
   and evil. More than forty cases developed within another week, and nurses
   had to be brought from the city. Clarendon went home very seldom at this
   stage, often sleeping on a cot in the warden's quarters, and always giving
   himself up with typical abandon to the service of medicine and mankind.

   Then came the first mutterings of that storm which was soon to convulse
   San Francisco. News will out, and the menace of black fever spread over
   the town like a fog from the bay. Reporters trained in the doctrine of
   'sensation first' used their imagination without restraint, and gloried
   when at last they were able to produce a case in the Mexican quarter which
   a local physician - fonder perhaps of money than of truth or civic welfare
   - pronounced black fever.

   That was the last straw. Frantic at the thought of the crawling death so
   close upon them, the people of San Francisco went mad en masse, and
   embarked upon that historic exodus of which all the country was soon to
   hear over busy wires. Ferries and rowboats, excursion steamers and
   launches, railways and cable-cars, bicycles and carriages, moving-vans and
   work carts, all were pressed into instant and frenzied service. Sausalito
   and Tamalpais, as lying in the direction of San Quentin, shared in the
   flight; while housing space in Oakley, Berkeley, and Alameda rose to
   fabulous prices. Tent colonies sprang up, and improvised villages lined
   the crowded southward highways from Millbrae to San Jose. Many sought
   refuge with friends in Sacramento, while the fright-shaken residue forced
   by various causes to stay behind could do little more than maintain the
   basic necessities of a nearly dead city.

   Business, save for quack doctors with 'sure cures' and 'preventives' for
   use against the fever, fell rapidly to the vanishing-point. At first the
   saloons offered 'medicated drinks', but soon found that the populace
   preferred to be duped by charlatans of more professional aspect. In
   strangely noiseless streets persons peered into one another's faces to
   glimpse possible plague symptoms, and shopkeepers began more and more to
   refuse admission to their clientele, each customer seeming to them a fresh
   fever menace. Legal and judicial machinery began to disintegrate as
   attorneys and county clerks succumbed one by one to the urge for flight.
   Even the doctors deserted in large numbers, many of them pleading the need
   of vacations among the mountains and the lakes in the northern part of the
   state. Schools and colleges, theatres and cafeterias, restaurants and
   saloons, all gradually closed their doors; and in a single week San
   Francisco lay prostate and inert with only its light, power, and water
   service even half normal, with newspapers in skeletonic form, and with a
   crippled parody on transportation maintained by the horse and cable cars.

   This was the lowest ebb. It could not last long, for courage and
   observation are not altogether dead in mankind; and sooner or later the
   non-existence of any widespread black fever epidemic outside San Quentin
   became too obvious a fact to deny, notwithstanding several actual cases
   and the undeniable spread of typhoid in the unsanitary suburban tent
   colonies. The leaders and editors of the commentary conferred and took
   action, enlisting in their service the very reporters whose energies had
   done so much to bring on the trouble, but now turning their 'sensation
   first' avidity into more constructive channels. Editorials and fictitious
   interviews appeared, telling of Dr. Clarendon's complete control of the
   disease, and of the absolute impossibility of its diffusion beyond the
   prison walls. Reiteration and circulation slowly did their work, and
   gradually a slim backward trickle of urbanites swelled into a vigorous
   refluent stream. One of the first healthy symptoms was the start of a
   newspaper controversy of the approved acrimonious kind, attempting to fix
   blame for the panic wherever the various participants thought it belonged.
   The returning doctors, jealously strengthened by their timely vacations,
   began striking at Clarendon, assuring the public that they as well as he
   would keep the fever in leash, and censuring him for not doing even more
   to check its spread within San Quentin.

   Clarendon had, they averred, permitted far more deaths that were
   necessary. The veriest tyro in medicine knew how to check fever contagion;
   and if this renowned savant did not do it, it was clearly because he chose
   for scientific reasons to study the final effects of the disease, rather
   than to prescribe properly and save the victims. This policy, they
   insinuated, might be proper enough among convicted murderers in a penal
   institution, but it would not do in San Francisco, where life was still a
   precious and sacred thing. Thus they went on, the papers were glad to
   publish all they wrote, since the sharpness of the campaign, in which Dr.
   Clarendon would doubtless join, would help to obliterate confusion and
   restore confidence among the people.

   But Clarendon did not reply. He only smiled, while his singular clinic-man
   Surama indulged in many a deep, testudinous chuckle. He was at home more
   nowadays, so that reporters began besieging the gate of the great wall the
   doctor had built around his house, instead of pestering the warden's
   office at San Quentin. Results, though, were equally meagre; for Surama
   formed an impassable barrier between the doctor and the outer world - even
   after the reporters had got into the grounds. The newspaper men getting
   access to the front hall had glimpses of Clarendon's singular entourage
   and made the best they could in a 'write-up' of Surama and the queer
   skeletonic Thibetans. Exaggeration, of course, occurred in every fresh
   article, and the net effect of the publicity was distinctly adverse to the
   great physician. Most persons hate the unusual, and hundreds who could
   have excused heartlessness or incompetence stood ready to condemn the
   grotesque taste manifested in the chuckling attendant and the eight
   black-robed Orientals.

   Early in January an especially persistent young man from the Observer
   climbed the moated eight-foot brick wall in the rear of the Clarendon
   grounds and began a survey of the varied outdoor appearances which tree
   concealed from the front walk. With quick, alert brain he took in
   everything - the rose-arbour, the aviaries, the animal cages where all
   sorts of mammalia from monkeys to guinea-pigs might be seen and heard, the
   stout wooden clinic building with barred windows in the northwest corner
   of the yard - and bent searching glances throughout the thousand square
   feet of intramural privacy. A great article was brewing, and he would have
   escaped unscathed but for the barking of Dick, Georgina Clarendon's
   gigantic and beloved St. Bernard. Surama, instant in his response, had the
   youth by the collar before a protest could be uttered, and was presently
   shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat, and dragging him through the trees
   to the front yard and the gate.

   Breathless explanations and quavering demands to see Dr. Clarendon were
   useless. Surama only chuckled and dragged his victim on. Suddenly a
   positive fright crept over the dapper scribe, and he began to wish
   desperately that this unearthly creature would speak, if only to prove
   that he really was a being of honest flesh and blood belonging to this
   planet. He became deathly sick, and strove not to glimpse the eyes which
   he knew must lie at the base of those gaping black sockets. Soon he heard
   the gate open and felt himself propelled violently through; in another
   moment waking rudely to the things of earth as he landed wetly and muddily
   in the ditch which Clarendon had had dug around the entire length of the
   wall. Fright gave a place to rage as he heard the massive gate slam shut,
   and he rose dripping to shake his fist at the forbidding portal. Then, as
   he turned to go, a soft sound grated behind him, and through a small
   wicket in the gate he felt the sunken eyes of Surama and heard the echoes
   of a deep-voiced, blood-freezing chuckle.

   This young man, feeling perhaps justly that his handling had been rougher
   than he deserved, resolved to revenge himself upon the household
   responsible for his treatment. Accordingly he prepared a fictitious
   interview with Dr. Clarendon, supposed to be held in the clinic building,
   during which he was careful to describe the agonies of a dozen black fever
   patients whom his imagination arranged on orderly rows of couches. His
   master-stroke was the picture of one especially pathetic sufferer gasping
   for water, while the doctor held a glass of the sparkling fluid just out
   of his reach, in a scientific attempt to determine the effect of a
   tantalising emotion on the course of the disease. This invention was
   followed by paragraphs of insinuating comment so outwardly respectful that
   it bore a double venom. Dr. Clarendon was, the article ran, undoubtedly
   the greatest and most single-minded scientist in the world; but science is
   no friend to individual welfare, and one would not like to have one's
   gravest ills drawn out and aggravated merely to satisfy an investigator on
   some point of abstract truth. Life is too short for that.

   Altogether, the article was diabolically skilful, and succeeded in
   horrifying nine readers out of ten against Dr. Clarendon and his supposed
   methods. Other papers were quick to copy and enlarge upon its substance,
   taking the cue it offered, and commencing a series of 'faked' interviews
   which fairly ran the gamut of derogatory fantasy. In no case, however, did
   the doctor condescend to offer a contradiction. He had no time to waste on
   fools and liars, and cared little for the esteem of a thoughtless rabble
   he despised. When James Dalton telegraphed his regrets and offered aid,
   Clarendon replied with an almost boorish curtness. He did not heed the
   barking of dogs, and could not bother to muzzle them. Nor would he thank
   anyone for messing with a matter wholly beneath notice. Silent and
   contemptuous, he continued his duties with tranquil evenness.

   But the young reporter's spark had done its work. San Francisco was insane
   again, and this time as much with rage as with fear. Sober judgment became
   a lost art; and though no second exodus occurred, there ensued a reign of
   vice and recklessness born of desperation, and suggesting parallel
   phenomena in mediaeval times of pestilence. Hatred ran riot against the
   man who had found the disease and was struggling to restrain it, and a
   light-headed public forgot his great services to knowledge in their
   efforts to fan the flames of resentment. They seemed, in their blindness,
   to hate him in person, rather than the plague which had come to their
   breeze-cleaned and usually healthy city.

   Then the young reporter, playing in the Neronic fire he had kindled, added
   a crowning personal touch of his own. Remembering the indignities he had
   suffered at the hands of the cadaverous clinic-man, he prepared a masterly
   article on the home and environment of Dr. Clarendon, giving especial
   prominence to Surama, whose very aspect he declared sufficient to scare
   the healthiest person into any sort of fever. He tried to make the gaunt
   chuckler appear equally ridiculous and terrible, succeeding best, perhaps,
   in the latter half of his intention, since a tide of horror always welled
   up whenever he thought of his brief proximity to the creature. He
   collected all the rumours current about the man, elaborated on the unholy
   depth of his reputed scholarship, and hinted darkly that it could have
   been no godly realm of secret and aeon-weighed Africa wherein Dr.
   Clarendon had found him.

   Georgina, who followed the papers closely, felt crushed and hurt by these
   attacks upon her brother, but James Dalton, who called often at the house,
   did his best to comfort her. In this he was warm and sincere; for he
   wished not only to console the woman he loved, but to utter some measure
   of the reverence he had always felt for the starward-bound genius who had
   been his youth's closest comrade. He told Georgina how greatness can never
   be exempted from the shafts of envy, and cited the long, sad list of
   splendid brains crushed beneath vulgar heels. The attacks, he pointed out,
   formed the truest of all proofs of Alfred's solid eminence.

   "But they hurt just the same," she replied, "and all the more because I
   know that Al really suffers from them, no matter how indifferent he tries
   to be."

   Dalton kissed her hand in a manner not then obsolete among well-born
   persona.

   "And it hurts me a thousand times more, knowing that it hurts you and Alf.
   But never mind, Georgie, we'll stand together and pull through it!"

   Thus it came about that Georgina came more and more to rely on the
   strength of the steel-firm, square-jawed governor who had been her
   youthful swain, and more and more to confide in him the things she feared.
   The press attacks and the epidemic were not quite all. There were aspects
   of the household which she did not like. Surama, cruel in equal measure to
   man and beast, filled her with the most unnamable repulsion; and she could
   not help but feel he meant some vague, indefinable harm to Alfred. She did
   not like the Thibetans, either, and thought it very peculiar that Surama
   was able to talk with them. Alfred would not tell her who or what Surama
   was, but had once explained rather haltingly that he was a much older man
   that he was a much older man than would be commonly thought credible, and
   that he had mastered secrets and been through experiences calculated to
   make him a colleague of phenomenal value for any scientist seeking
   Nature's hidden mysteries.

   Urged by her uneasiness, Dalton became a still more frequent visitor at
   the Clarendon home, though he saw that his presence was deeply resented by
   Surama. The bony clinic-man formed the habit of glaring peculiarly from
   those spectral sockets when admitting him, and would often, after closing
   the gate when he left, chuckle monotonously in a manner that made his
   flesh creep. Meanwhile Dr. Clarendon seemed oblivious of everything save
   his work at San Quentin, whither he went each day in his launch - alone
   save for Surama, who managed the wheel while the doctor read or collated
   his notes. Dalton welcomed these regular absences, for they gave him
   constant opportunities to renew his suit for Georgina's hand. When he
   would overstay and meet Alfred, however, the latter's greeting was always
   friendly despite his habitual reserve. In time the engagement of James and
   Georgina grew to be a definite thing, and the two awaited only a
   favourable time to speak to Alfred.

   The governor, whole-souled in everything and firm in his protective
   loyalty, spared no pains in spreading propaganda on his old friend's
   behalf. Press and officialdom both felt his influence, and he even
   succeeded in interesting scientists in the East, many of whom came to
   California to study the plague and investigate the anti-fever bacillus
   which Clarendon was so rapidly isolating and perfecting. These doctors and
   biologists, however, did not obtain the information they wished; so that
   several of them left with a very unfortunate impression. Not a few
   prepared articles hostile to Clarendon, accusing him of an unscientific
   and fame-seeking attitude, and intimating that he concealed his methods
   through a highly unprofessional desire for ultimate personal profit.

   Others, fortunately, were more liberal in their judgments, and wrote
   enthusiastically of Clarendon and his work. They had seen the patients,
   and could appreciate how marvellously he held the dread disease in leash.
   His secrecy regarding the antitoxin they deemed quite justifiable, since
   its public diffusion in unperfected form could not but do more harm than
   good. Clarendon himself, whom many of their number had met before,
   impressed them more profoundly than ever, and they did not hesitate to
   compare him with Jenner, Lister, Koch, Pasteur, Metchnikoff, and the rest
   of those whose whole lives have served pathology and humanity. Dalton was
   careful to save for Alfred all the magazines that spoke well of him,
   bringing them in person as an excuse to see Georgina. They did not,
   however, produce much effect save a contemptuous smile; and Clarendon
   would generally throw them to Surama, whose deep, disturbing chuckle upon
   reading formed a close parallel to the doctor's own ironic amusement.

   One Monday evening early in February Dalton called with the definite
   impression asking Clarendon for his sister's hand. Georgina herself
   admitted him to the grounds, and as they walked toward the house he
   stopped to pat the great dog which rushed up and laid friendly fore paws
   on his breast. It was Dick, Georgina's cherished St. Bernard, and Dalton
   was glad to feel that he had the affection of a creature which meant so
   much to her.

   Dick was excited and glad, and turned the governor nearly half about with
   his vigorous pressure as he gave a soft quick bark and sprang off through
   the trees toward the clinic. He did not vanish, though, but presently
   stopped and looked back, softly barking again as if he wished Dalton to
   follow. Georgina, fond of obeying her huge pet's playful whims, motioned
   to James to see what he wanted; and they both walked slowly after him as
   he trotted relievedly to the rear of the yard where the top of the clinic
   building stood silhouetted against the stars above the great brick wall.

   The outline of lights within shewed around the edges of the dark
   window-curtains, so they knew that Alfred and Surama were at work.
   Suddenly from the interior came a thin, subdued sound like the cry of a
   child - a plaintive call of 'Mamma! Mamma!' at which Dick barked, while
   James and Georgina started perceptibly. Then Georgina smiled, remembering
   the parrots that Clarendon always kept for experimental uses, and patted
   Dick on the head either to forgive him for having fooled her and Dalton,
   or to console him for having been fooled himself.

   As they turned toward the house Dalton mentioned his resolve to speak to
   Alfred that evening about their engagement, and Georgina supplied no
   objection. She knew that her brother would not relish the loss of a
   faithful manager and companion, but believed his affection would place no
   barrier in the way of her happiness.

   Later that evening Clarendon came into the house with a springy step and
   aspect less grim than usual. Dalton, seeing a good omen in this easy
   buoyancy, took heart as the doctor wrung his hand with a jovial "Ah,
   Jimmy, how's politics this year?" He glanced at Georgina, and she quietly
   excused herself, while the two men settled down to a chat on general
   subjects. Little by little, amidst many reminders of their old youthful
   days, Dalton worked toward his point; till at last he came out plainly
   with the crucial inquiry.

   "Alf, I want to marry Georgina. Have we your blessing?"

   Keenly watching his old friend, Dalton saw a shadow steal over his face.
   The dark eyes flashed for a moment, then veiled themselves as wonted
   placidity returned. So science or selfishness was at work after all!

   "You're asking an impossibility, James. Georgina isn't the aimless
   butterfly she was years ago. She has a place in the service of truth and
   mankind now, and that place is here. She's decided to devote her life to
   my work - or the household that makes my work possible - and there's no
   room for desertion or personal caprice."

   Dalton waited to see if had finished. The same old fanaticism - humanity
   versus the individual - and the doctor was going to let it spoil his
   sister's life! Then he tried to answer.

   "But look here, Alf, do you mean to say that Georgina, in particular, is
   so necessary to your work that you must make a slave and martyr out of
   her? Use your sense of proportion, man! If it were a question of Surama or
   somebody in the utter thick of your experiments it might be different;
   but, after all, Georgina is only a housekeeper to you in the last
   analysis. She has promised to be my wife and says that she loves me. Have
   you the right to cut her off from the life that belongs to her? Have you
   the right - "

   "That'll do, James!" Clarendon's face was set and white. "Whether or not I
   have the right to govern my own family is no business of an outsider."

   "Outsider - you can say that to a man who - " Dalton almost choked as the
   steely voice of the doctor interrupted him again.

   "An outsider to my family, and from now on an outsider to my home. Dalton,
   your presumption goes just a little too far! Good evening, Governor!"

   And Clarendon strode from the room without extending his hand.

   Dalton hesitated for a moment, almost at a loss what to do, when presently
   Georgina entered. Her face shewed that she had spoken with her brother,
   and Dalton took both her hands impetuously.

   "Well, Georgie, what do you say? I'm afraid it's a choice between Alf and
   me. You know how I feel - you know how I felt before when it was your
   father I was up against. What's your answer this time?"

   He paused as she responded slowly.

   "James, dear, do you believe that I love you?"

   He nodded and pressed her hands expectantly.

   "Then, if you love me, you'll wait a while. Don't think of Al's rudeness.
   He's to be pitied. I can't tell you the whole thing now, but you know how
   worried I am - what with the strain of his work, the criticism, and the
   staring and cackling of that horrible creature Surama! I'm afraid he'll
   break down - he shews the strain more than anyone outside the family could
   tell. I can see it, for I've watched him all my life. He's changing -
   slowly bending under his burdens - and he puts on his extra brusqueness to
   hide it. You can see what I mean, can't you, dear?"

   She paused, and Dalton nodded again, pressing one of her hands to his
   breast. Then she concluded.

   "So promise me, dear, to be patient. I must stand by him; I must! I must!"

   Dalton did not speak for a while, but his head inclined in what was almost
   a bow of reverence. There was more of Christ in this devoted woman than he
   had thought any human being possessed, and in the face of such love and
   loyalty he could do no urging.

   Words of sadness and parting were brief; and James, whose blue eyes were
   misty, scarcely saw the gaunt clinic-man as the gate to the street was at
   last opened to him. But when it slammed to behind him he heard that
   blood-curdling chuckle he had come to recognize so well, and knew that
   Surama was there - Surama, whom Georgina had called her brother's evil
   genius. Walking away with a firm step, Dalton resolved to be watchful, and
   to act at the first sign of trouble.

                                      III.

   Meanwhile San Francisco, the epidemic still on the lips of all, seethed
   with anti-Clarendon feeling. Actually the cases outside the penitentiary
   were very few, and confined almost wholly to the lower Mexican element
   whose lack of sanitation was a standing invitation to disease of every
   kind; but politicians and the people needed no more than this to confirm
   the attacks made by the doctor's enemies. Seeing that Dalton was immovable
   in his championship of Clarendon, the malcontents, medical dogmatists, and
   wardheelers turned their attention to the state legislature; lining up the
   anti-Clarendonists and the governor's old enemies with great shrewdness,
   and preparing to launch a law - with a veto-proof majority - transferring
   the authority for minor institutional appointments from the chief
   executive to the various boards or commissions concerned.

   In the furtherance of this measure no lobbyist was more active than
   Clarendon's chief successor, Dr. Jones. Jealous of his superior from the
   first, he now saw an opportunity for turning matters to his liking; and he
   thanked fate for the circumstance - responsible indeed for his present
   position - of his relationship to the chairman of the prison board. The
   new law, if passed, would certainly mean the removal of Clarendon and the
   appointment of himself in his stead; so, mindful of his own interest, he
   worked hard for it. Jones was all that Clarendon was not - a natural
   politician and sycophantic opportunist who served his own advancement
   first and science only incidentally. He was poor, and avid for salaried
   position, quite in contrast to the wealthy and independent savant he
   sought to displace. So with a rat-like cunning and persistence he laboured
   to undermine the great biologist above him, and was one day rewarded by
   the news that the new law was passed. Thenceforward the governor was
   powerless to make appointments to the state institutions, and the medical
   dictatorship of San Quentin lay at the disposal of the prison board.

   Of all this legislative turmoil Clarendon was singularly oblivious.
   Wrapped wholly in matters of administration and research, he was blind to
   the treason of 'that ass Jones' who worked by his side, and deaf to all
   the gossip of the warden's office. He had never in his life read the
   newspapers, and the banishment of Dalton from his home cut off his last
   real link with the world of outside events. With the naivete of a recluse,
   he at no time thought of his position as insecure. In view of Dalton's
   loyalty, and of his forgiveness of even the greatest wrongs, as shewn in
   his dealings with the elder Clarendon who had crushed his father to death
   on the stock exchange, the possibility of a gubernatorial dismissal was,
   of course, out of the question; nor could the doctor's political ignorance
   envisage a sudden shift of power which might place the matter of retention
   or dismissal in very different hands. Thereupon he merely smiled with
   satisfaction when Dalton left for Sacramento; convinced that his place in
   San Quentin and his sister's place in his household were alike secure from
   disturbance. He was accustomed to having what he wanted, and fancied his
   luck was still holding out.

   The first week in March, a day or so after the enactment of the new law,
   the chairman of the prison board called at San Quentin. Clarendon was out,
   but Dr. Jones was glad to shew the august visitor - his own uncle,
   incidentally - through the great infirmary, including the fever ward made
   so famous by press and panic. By this time converted against his will to
   Clarendon's belief in the fever's non-contagiousness, Jones smilingly
   assured his uncle that nothing was to be feared, and encouraged him to
   inspect the patients in detail - especially a ghastly skeleton, once a
   very giant of bulk and vigour, who was, he insinuated, slowly and
   painfully dying because Clarendon would not administer the proper
   medicine.

   "Do you mean to say," cried the chairman, "that Dr. Clarendon refuses to
   let the man have what he needs, knowing his life could be saved?"

   "Just that," snapped Dr. Jones, pausing as the door opened to admit none
   other than Clarendon himself. Clarendon nodded coldly to Jones and
   surveyed the visitor, whom he did not know, with disapproval.

   "Dr. Jones, I thought you knew this case was not to be disturbed at all.
   And haven't I said that visitors aren't to be admitted except by special
   permission?"

   But the chairman interrupted before his nephew could introduce him.

   "Pardon me, Dr. Clarendon, but am I to understand that you refuse to give
   this man the medicine that would save him?"

   Clarendon glared coldly, and rejoined with steel in his voice,

   "That's an impertinent question, sir. I am in authority here, and visitors
   are not allowed. Please leave the room at once."

   The chairman, his sense of drama secretly tickled, answered with greater
   pomp and hauteur than were necessary.

   "You mistake me, sir! I, not you, am master here. You are addressing the
   chairman of the prison board. I must say, however, that I deem your
   activity a menace to the welfare of the prisoners, and must request your
   resignation. Henceforth Dr. Jones will be in charge, and if you choose to
   remain until your formal dismissal you will take your orders from him."

   It was Wilfred Jones's great moment. Life never gave him another such
   climax, and we need not grudge him this one. After all, he was a small
   rather than a bad man, and he had only obeyed a small man's code of
   looking to himself at all costs. Clarendon stood still, gazing at the
   speaker as if he thought him mad, till in another second the look of
   triumph on Dr. Jones's face convinced him that something important was
   indeed afoot. He was icily courteous as he replied.

   "No doubt you are what you claim to be, sir. But fortunately my
   appointment came from the governor of the state, and can therefore be
   revoked only by him."

   The chairman and his nephew both stared perplexedly, for they had not
   realized to what lengths unworldly ignorance can go. Then the older man,
   grasping the situation, explained at some length.

   "Had I found that the current reports did you an injustice," he concluded,
   "I would have deferred action; but the case of this poor man and your own
   arrogant manner left me no choice. As it is - "

   But Dr. Clarendon interrupted with a new razor-sharpness in his voice.

   "As it is, I am the director in charge at present, and I ask you to leave
   this room at once."

   The chairman reddened and exploded.

   "Look here, sir, who do you think you're talking to? I'll have you chucked
   out of here - damn your impertinence!"

   But he had time only to finish the sentence. Transferred by the insult to
   a sudden dynamo of hate, the slender scientist launched out with both
   fists in a burst of preternatural strength of which no one would have
   thought him capable. And if his strength was preternatural, his accuracy
   of aim was no less so; for not even a champion of the ring could have
   wrought a neater result. Both men - the chairman and Dr. Jones - were
   squarely hit; the one full in the face and the other on the point of the
   chin. Going down like felled trees, they lay motionless and unconscious on
   the floor; while Clarendon, now clear and completely master of himself,
   took his hat and cane and went out to join Surama in the launch. Only when
   seated in the moving boat did he at last give audible vent to the
   frightful rage that consumed him. Then, with face convulsed, he called
   down imprecations from the stars and the gulfs beyond the stars; so that
   even Surama shuddered, made an elder sign that no book of history records,
   and forgot to chuckle.

                                      IV.

   Georgina soothed her brother's hurt as best she could. He had come home
   mentally and physically exhausted and thrown himself on the library
   lounge; and in that gloomy room, little by little, the faithful sister had
   taken in the almost incredible news. Her consolations were instantaneous
   and tender, and she made him realise how vast, though unconscious, a
   tribute to his greatness the attacks, persecution, and dismissal all were.
   He had tried to cultivate the indifference she preached, and could have
   done so had personal dignity alone been involved. But the loss of
   scientific opportunity was more than he could calmly bear, and he sighed
   again and again as he repeated how three months more of study in the
   prison might have given him at last the long-sought bacillus which would
   make all fever a thing of the past.

   Then Georgina tried another mode of cheering, and told him that surely the
   prison board would send for him again if the fever did not abate, or if it
   broke out with increased force. But even this was ineffective, and
   Clarendon answered only in a string of bitter, ironic, and
   half-meaningless little sentences whose tone shewed all too clearly how
   deeply despair and resentment had bitten.

   "Abate? Break out again? Oh, it'll abate all right! At least, they'll
   think it has abated. They'd think anything, no matter what happens!
   Ignorant eyes see nothing, and bunglers are never discovered. Science
   never shews her face to that sort. And they call themselves doctors! Best
   of all, fancy that ass Jones in charge!"

   Coming with a quick sneer, he laughed so daemonically that Georgina
   shivered.

   The days that followed were dismal ones indeed at the Clarendon mansion.
   Depression, stark and unrelieved, had taken hold of the doctor's usually
   tireless mind; and he would even have refused food had not Georgina forced
   it upon him. His great notebook of observations lay unopened on the
   library table, and his little gold syringe of anti-fever serum - a clever
   device of his own, with a self-contained reservoir, attached to a broad
   gold ring, and single-pressure action peculiar to itself - rested idly in
   a small leather case beside it. Vigour, ambition, and the desire for study
   and observation seemed to have died within him; and he made no inquiries
   about his clinic, where hundreds of germ cultures stood in their orderly
   phials awaiting his attention.

   The countless animals held for experiments played, lively and well fed, in
   the early spring sunshine; and as Georgina strolled out through the
   rose-arbour to the cages she felt a strangely incongruous sense of
   happiness about her. She knew, though, how tragically transient that
   happiness must be; since the start of new work would soon make all these
   small creatures unwilling martyrs to science. Knowing this, she glimpsed a
   sort of compensating element in her brother's inaction, and encouraged him
   to keep on in a rest he needed so badly. The eight Thibetan servants moved
   noiselessly about, each as impeccable effective as usual; and Georgina saw
   to it that the order of the household did not suffer because of the
   master's relaxation.

   Study and starward ambition laid aside in slippered and dressing-gowned
   indifference, Clarendon was content to let Georgina treat him as an
   infant. He met her maternal fussiness with a slow, sad smile, and always
   obeyed her multitude of orders and precepts. A kind of faint, wistful
   felicity came over the languid household, amidst which the only dissenting
   note was supplied by Surama. He indeed was miserable, and looked often
   with sullen and resentful eyes at the sunny serenity in Georgina's face.
   His only joy had been the turmoil of experiment, and he missed the routine
   of seizing the fated animals, bearing them to the clinic in clutching
   talons, and watching them with hot brooding gaze and evil chuckles as they
   gradually fell into the final coma with wide-opened, red-rimmed eyes, and
   swollen tongue lolling from froth-covered mouth.

   Now he was seemingly driven to desperation by the sight of the carefree
   creatures in their cages, and frequently came to ask Clarendon if there
   were any orders. Finding the doctor apathetic and unwilling to begin work,
   he would go away muttering under his breath and glaring curses upon
   everything; stealing with cat-like tread to his own quarters in the
   basement, where his voice would sometimes ascend in deep, muffled rhythms
   of blasphemous strangeness and uncomfortable ritualistic suggestion.

   All this wore on Georgina's nerves, but not by any means so gravely as her
   brother's continued lassitude itself. The duration of the state alarmed
   her, and little by little she lost the air of cheerfulness which had so
   provoked the clinic-man. Herself skilled in medicine, she found the
   doctor's condition highly unsatisfactory from an alienist's point of view;
   and she now feared as much from his absence of interest and activity as
   she had formerly feared from his fanatical zeal and overstudy. Was
   lingering melancholy about to turn the once brilliant man of intellect
   into an innocuous imbecile?

   Then, toward the end of May, came the sudden change. Georgina always
   recalled the smallest details connected with it; details as trivial as the
   box delivered to Surama the day before, postmarked Algiers, and emitting a
   most unpleasant odour; and the sharp, sudden thunderstorm, rare in the
   extreme for California, which sprang up that night as Surama chanted his
   rituals behind his locked basement door in a droning chest-voice louder
   and more intense than usual.

   It was a sunny day, and she had been in the garden gathering flowers for
   the dining-room. Re-entering the house, she glimpsed her brother in the
   library, fully dressed and seated at the table, alternately consulting the
   notes in his thick observation book, and making fresh entries with brisk
   assured strokes of the pen. He was alert and vital, and there was a
   satisfying resilience about his movements as he now and then turned a
   page, or reached for a book from the rear of the great table. Delighted
   and relieved, Georgina hastened to deposit her flowers in the dining-room
   and returned; but when she reached the library again she found that her
   brother was gone.

   She knew, of course, that he must be in the clinic at work, and rejoiced
   to think that his old mind and purpose had snapped back into place.
   Realizing it would be of no use to delay the luncheon for him, she at
   alone and set aside a bite to be kept warm in case of his return at an odd
   moment. But he did not come. He was making up for lost time, and was still
   in the great stout-planked clinic when she went for a stroll through the
   rose-arbour.

   As she walked among the fragrant blossoms she saw Surama fetching animals
   for the test. She wished she could notice him less, for he always made her
   shudder; but her very dread had sharpened her eyes and ears where he was
   concerned. He always went hatless around the yard, and total hairlessness
   of his head enhanced his skeleton-like aspect horribly. Now she heard a
   faint chuckle as he took a small monkey from its cage against the wall and
   carried it to the clinic, his long, bony fingers pressing so cruelly into
   its furry sides that it cried out in frightened anguish. The sight
   sickened her, and brought her walk to an end. Her inmost soul rebelled at
   the ascendancy this creature had gained over her brother, and she
   reflected bitterly that the two had almost changed places as master and
   servant.

   Night came without Clarendon's return to the house, and Georgina concluded
   that he was absorbed in one of his very longest sessions, which meant
   total disregard of time. She hated to retire without a talk with him about
   his sudden recovery; but finally, feeling it would be futile to wait up,
   she wrote a cheerful note and propped it before his chair on the library
   table; then started resolutely for bed.

   She was not quite asleep when she heard the outer door open and shut. So
   it had not been an all night session after all! Determined to see that her
   brother had a meal before retiring she rose, slipped on a robe, and
   descended to the library, halting only when she heard voices from behind
   the half-opened door. Clarendon and Surama were talking, and she waited
   till the clinic-man might go.

   Surama, however, shewed no inclination to depart; and indeed, the whole
   heated tenor of the discourse seemed to bespeak absorption and promise
   length. Georgina, though she had not meant to listen, could not help
   catching a phrase now and then, and presently became aware of a sinister
   undercurrent which frightened her very much without being wholly clear to
   her. Her brother's voice, nervous, incisive, held her notice with
   disquieting persistence.

   "But anyway," he was saying, "we haven't enough animals for another day,
   and you know how hard it is to get a decent supply at short notice. It
   seems silly to waste so much effort on comparative trash when human
   specimens could be had with just a little extra care."

   Georgina sickened at the possible implication, and caught at the hall rack
   to steady herself. Surama was replying in that deep, hollow tone which
   seemed too echo with the evil of a thousand ages and a thousand planets.

   "Steady, steady - what a child you are with your haste and impatience! You
   crowd things so! When you've lived as I have, so that a whole life will
   seem only an hour, you won't be so fretful about a day or week or month!
   You work too fast. You've plenty of specimens in the cages for a full week
   if you'll only go at a sensible rate. You might even begin on the older
   material if you'd be sure not to overdo it."

   "Never mind my haste!" the reply was snapped out sharply. "I have my own
   methods. I don't want to use our material if I can help it, for I prefer
   them as they are. And you'd better be careful of them anyway - you know
   the knives some of those sly dogs carry."

   Surama's deep chuckle came.

   "Don't worry about that. The brutes eat, don't they? Well, I can get you
   one any time you need it. But go slow - with the boy gone, there are only
   eight, and now that you've lost San Quentin it'll be hard to get new ones
   by the wholesale. I'd advise you to start in on Tsanpo - he's the least
   use to you as he is, and - "

   But that was all Georgina heard. Transfixed by a hideous dread from the
   thoughts this talk excited, she nearly sank to the floor where she stood,
   and was scarcely able to drag herself up the stairs and into her room.
   What was the evil monster Surama planning? Into what was he guiding her
   brother? What monstrous circumstances lay behind these cryptic sentences?
   A thousand phantoms of darkness and menace danced before her eyes, and she
   flung herself upon the bed without hope of sleep. One thought above the
   rest stood out with fiendish prominence, and she almost screamed aloud as
   it beat itself into her brain with renewed force. Then Nature, kinder than
   she expected, intervened at last. Closing her eyes in a dead faint, she
   did not awake till morning, nor did any fresh nightmare come to join the
   lasting one which the overheard words had brought.

   With the morning sunshine came a lessening of the tension. What happens in
   the night when one is tired often reaches the consciousness in distorted
   forms, and Georgina could see that her brain must have given strange
   colour to scraps of common medical conversation. To suppose her brother -
   only son of the gentle Frances Schuyler Clarendon - guilty of strange
   sacrifices in the name of science would be to do an injustice to their
   blood, and she decided to omit all mention of her trip downstairs, lest
   Alfred ridicule her fantastic notions.

   When she reached the breakfast table she found that Clarendon was already
   gone, and regretted that not even this second morning had given her a
   chance to congratulate him on his revived activity. Quietly taking the
   breakfast served by stone-deaf old Margarita, the Mexican cook, she read
   the morning paper and seated herself with some needlework by the
   sitting-room window overlooking the great yard. All was silent out there,
   and she could see that the last of the animal cages had been emptied.
   Science was served, and the lime-pit held all that was left of the once
   pretty and lively little creatures. This slaughter had always grieved her,
   but she had never complained, since she knew it was all for humanity.
   Being a scientist's sister, she used to say to herself, was like being the
   sister of a soldier who kills to save his countrymen from their foes.

   After luncheon Georgina resumed her post by the window, and had been busy
   sewing for some time when the sound of a pistol shot from the yard caused
   her to look out in alarm. There, not far from the clinic, she saw the
   ghastly form of Surama, a revolver in his hand, and his skull-face twisted
   into a strange expression as he chuckled at a cowering figure robed in
   black silk and carrying a long Thibetan knife. It was the servant Tsanpo,
   and as she recognised the shrivelled face Georgina remembered horribly
   what she had overheard the night before. The sun flashed on the polished
   blade, and suddenly Surama's revolver spat once more. This time the knife
   flew from the Mongol's hand, and Surama glanced greedily at his shaking
   and bewildered prey.

   Then Tsanpo, glancing quickly at his unhurt hand and at the fallen knife,
   sprang nimbly away from the stealthily approaching clinic-man and made a
   dash for the house. Surama, however, was too swift for him, and caught him
   in a single leap, seizing his shoulder and almost crushing him. For a
   moment the Thibetan tried to struggle, but Surama lifted him like an
   animal by the scruff of the neck and bore him off toward the clinic.
   Georgina heard him chuckling and taunting the man in his own tongue, and
   saw the yellow face of the victim twist and quiver with fright. Suddenly
   realising against her own will what was taking place, a great horror
   mastered her and she fainted for the second time within twenty-four hours.

   When consciousness returned, the golden light of late afternoon was
   flooding the room. Georgina, picking up her fallen work-basket and
   scattered materials, was lost in a daze of doubts; but finally felt
   convinced that the scene which had overcome her must have been all too
   tragically real. Her first fears, then, were horrible truths. What to do
   about it, nothing in her experience could tell her; and she was vaguely
   thankful that her brother did not appear. She must talk to him, but not
   now. She could not talk to anybody now. And, thinking shudderingly of the
   monstrous happening behind those barred clinic windows, she crept into bed
   for a long night of anguished sleeplessness.

   Rising haggardly on the following day, Georgina saw the doctor for the
   first time since his recovery. He was bustling about preoccupiedly,
   circulating between the house and the clinic, and paying little attention
   to anything besides his work. There was no chance for the dreaded
   interview, and Clarendon did not even notice his sister's worn-out aspect
   and hesitant manner.

   In the evening she heard him in the library, talking to himself in a
   fashion most unusual for him, and she felt that he was under a great
   strain which might culminate in the return of his apathy. Entering the
   room, she tried to clam him without referring to any trying subject, and
   forced a steadying cup of bouillon upon him. Finally she asked gently what
   was distressing him, and waited anxiously for his reply, hoping to hear
   that Surama's treatment of the poor Thibetan had horrified and outraged
   him.

   There was a note of fretfulness in his voice as he responded.

   "What's distressing me? Good God, Georgina, what isn't? Look at the cages
   and see if you have to ask again! Cleaned out - milked dry - not a cursed
   specimen left; and a line of the most important bacterial cultures
   incubating in their tubes without a chance to do an ounce of good! Days'
   work wasted - whole programme set back - it's enough to drive a man mad!
   How shall I ever get anywhere if I can't scrape up some decent subjects?"

   Georgina stroked his forehead.

   "I think you ought to rest a while, Al dear."

   He moved away.

   "Rest? That's good! That's damn good! What else have I been doing but
   resting and vegetating and staring blankly into space for the last fifty
   or a hundred or a thousand years? Just as I manage to shake off the
   clouds, I have to run short of material - and then I'm told to lapse back
   again into drooling stupefaction! God! And all the while some sneaking
   thief is probably working with my data and getting ready to come out ahead
   of me with the credit for my own work. I'll lose by a neck - some fool
   with the proper specimens will get the prize, when one week more with even
   half-adequate facilities would see me through with flying colours!"

   His voice rose querulously, and there was an overtone of mental strain
   which Georgina did not like. She answered softly, yet not so softly as to
   hint at the soothing of a psychopathic case.

   "But you're killing yourself with this worry and tension, and if you're
   dead, how can you do your work?"

   He gave a smile that was almost a sneer.

   "I guess a week or a month - all the time I need - wouldn't quite finish
   me, and it doesn't much matter what becomes of me or any other individual
   in the end. Science is what must be served - science - the austere cause
   of human knowledge. I'm like the monkeys and birds and guinea pigs I use -
   just a cog in the machine, to be used to the advantage of the whole. They
   had to be killed - I may have to be killed - what of it? Isn't the cause
   we serve worth that and more?"

   Georgina sighed. For a moment she wondered whether, after all, this
   ceaseless round of slaughter really was worthwhile.

   "But are you absolutely sure your discovery will be enough of a boon to
   humanity to warrant these sacrifices?"

   Clarendon's eyes flashed dangerously.

   "Humanity! What the deuce is humanity? Science! Dolts! Just individuals
   over and over again! Humanity is made for preachers to whom it means the
   blindly credulous. Humanity is made for the predatory rich to whom it
   speaks in terms of dollars and cents. Humanity is made for the politician
   to whom it signifies collective power to be used to his advantage. What is
   humanity? Nothing! Thank God that crude illusion doesn't last! What a
   grown man worships is truth - knowledge - science - light - the rending of
   the veil and the pushing back of the shadow. Knowledge, the juggernaut!
   There is death in our own ritual. We must kill - dissect - destroy - and
   all for the sake of discovery - the worship of the ineffable light. The
   goddess Science demands it. We test a doubtful poison by killing. How
   else? No thought for self - just knowledge - the effect must be known."

   His voice trailed off in a kind of temporary exhaustion, and Georgina
   shuddered slightly.

   "But this is horrible, Al! You shouldn't think of it that way!"

   Clarendon cackled sardonically, in a manner which stirred odd and
   repugnant associations in his sister's mind.

   "Horrible? You think what I say is horrible? You ought to hear Surama! I
   tell you, things were known to the priests of Atlantis that would have you
   drop dead of fright if you heard a hint of them. Knowledge was knowledge a
   hundred thousand years ago, when our especial forbears were shambling
   about Asia as speechless semi-apes! They know something of it in the
   Hoggar region - there are rumours in the farther uplands of Thibet - and
   once I heard an old man in China calling on Yog-Sothoth - "

   He turned pale, and made a curious sign in the air with his extended
   forefinger. Georgina felt genuinely alarmed, but became somewhat calmer as
   his speech took a less fantastic form.

   "Yes, it may be horrible, but it's glorious too. The pursuit of knowledge,
   I mean. Certainly, there's no slovenly sentiment connected with it.
   Doesn't Nature kill - constantly and remorselessly - and are any but fools
   horrified at the struggle? Killings are necessary. They are the glory of
   science. We learn something from them, and we can't sacrifice learning to
   sentiment. Hear the sentimentalities howl against vaccination! They fear
   it will kill the child. Well, what if it does? How else can we discover
   the laws of disease concerned? As a scientist's sister you ought to know
   better that to praise sentiment. You ought to help my work instead of
   hindering it!"

   "But, Al," protested Georgina, "I haven't the slightest intention of
   hindering your work. Haven't I always tried to help as much as I could? I
   am ignorant, I suppose, and can't help very actively; but at least I'm
   proud of you - proud for my own sake and for the family's sake - and I've
   always tried to smooth the way. You've given me credit for that many a
   time."

   Clarendon looked at her keenly.

   "Yes," he said jerkily as he rose and strode from the room, "you're right.
   You've always tried to help as best you know. You may have yet a chance to
   help still more."

   Georgina, seeing him disappear through the front door, followed him into
   the yard. Some distance away a lantern was shining through the trees, and
   as they approached it they saw Surama bending over a large object
   stretched on the ground. Clarendon, advancing, gave a short grunt; but
   when Georgina saw what it was she rushed up with a shriek. It was Dick,
   the great St. Bernard, and he was lying still with reddened eyes and
   protruding tongue.

   "He's sick, Al!" she cried. "Do something for him, quick!"

   The doctor looked at Surama, who had uttered something in a tongue unknown
   to Georgina.

   "Take him to the clinic," he ordered; "I'm afraid Dick's caught the
   fever."

   Surama took up the dog as he had taken poor Tsanpo the day before, and
   carried him silently to the building near the mall. He did not chuckle
   this time, but glanced at Clarendon with what appeared to be real anxiety.
   It almost seemed to Georgina that Surama was asking the doctor to save her
   pet.

   Clarendon, however, made no move to follow, but stood still for a moment
   and then sauntered slowly toward the house. Georgina, astonished at such
   callousness, kept up a running fire of entreaties on Dick's behalf, but it
   was of no use. Without paying the slightest attention to her pleas he made
   directly for the library and began to read in a large old book which had
   lain face down on the table. She put her hand on his shoulder as he sat
   there, but he did not speak or turn his head. He only kept on reading, and
   Georgina, glancing curiously over his shoulder, wondered in what strange
   alphabet this brass-bound tome was written.

   In the cavernous parlour across the hall, sitting alone in the dark a
   quarter of an hour later, Georgina came to her decision. Something was
   gravely wrong - just what, and to what extent, she scarcely dared
   formulate to herself - and it was time that she called in some stronger
   force to help her. Of course it must be James. He was powerful and
   capable, and his sympathy and affection would shew him the right thing to
   do. He had known Al always, and would understand.

   It was by this time rather late, but Georgina had resolved on action.
   Across the hall the light still shone from the library, and she looked
   wistfully at the doorway as she quietly donned a hat and left the house.
   Outside the gloomy mansion and forbidding grounds, it was only a short way
   to Jackson Street, where by good luck she found a carriage to take her to
   the Western Union telegraph office. There she carefully wrote out a
   message to James Dalton in Sacramento, asking him to come at once to San
   Francisco on a matter of the greatest importance to them all.

                                       V.

   Dalton was frankly perplexed by Georgina's sudden message. He had had no
   word from the Clarendons since that stormy February evening when Alfred
   had declared him an outsider to his home; and he in turn had studiously
   refrained from communicating, even when he had longed to express sympathy
   after the doctor's summary outing from office. He had fought hard to
   frustrate the politicians and keep the appointee power, and was bitterly
   sorry to watch the unseating of a man who, despite recent estrangements,
   still represented to him the ultimate ideal of scientific competence.

   Now, with this clearly frightened summons before him, he could not imagine
   what had happened. He knew, though, that Georgina was not one to lose her
   head or send forth a needless alarm; hence he wasted no time, but took the
   Overland which left Sacramento within the hour, going at once to his club
   and sending word to Georgina by a messenger that he was in town and wholly
   at her service.

   Meanwhile things had been quiescent at the Clarendon home, notwithstanding
   the doctor's continued taciturnity and his absolute refusal to report on
   the dog's condition. Shadows of evil seemed omnipresent and thickening,
   but for the moment there was a lull. Georgina was relieved to get Dalton's
   message and learn that he was close at hand, and sent back word that she
   would call him when necessity arose. Amidst all the gathering tension some
   faint compensating element seemed manifest, and Georgina finally decided
   that it was the absence of the lean Thibetans, whose stealthy, sinuous
   ways and disturbing exotic aspect had always annoyed her. They had
   vanished all at once; and old Margarita, the sole visible servant left in
   the house, told her they were helping their master and Surama at the
   clinic.

   The following morning - the twenty-eighth of May - long to be remembered -
   was dark and lowering, and Georgina felt the precarious calm wearing thin.
   She did not see her brother at all, but knew he was in the clinic hard at
   work at something despite the lack of specimens he had bewailed. She
   wondered how poor Tsanpo was getting along, and whether he had really been
   subjected to any serious inoculation, but it must be confessed that she
   wondered more about Dick. She longed to know whether Surama had done
   anything for the faithful dog amidst his master's oddly callous
   indifference. Surama's apparent solicitude on the night of Dick's seizure
   had impressed her greatly, giving her perhaps the kindliest feeling she
   had ever had for the detested clinic-man. Now, as the day advanced, she
   found herself thinking more and more of Dick; till at last her harassed
   nerves, finding in this one detail a sort of symbolic summation of the
   whole horror that lay upon the household, could stand the suspense no
   longer.

   Up to that time she had always respected Al's imperious wish that he be
   never approached or disturbed at the clinic; but as this fateful afternoon
   advanced, her resolution to break through the barrier grew stronger and
   stronger. Finally she set out with determined face, crossing the yard and
   entering the unlocked vestibule of the forbidden structure with the fixed
   intention of discovering how the dog was or of knowing the reason for her
   brother's secrecy.

   The inner door, as usual, was locked; and behind it she heard voices in
   heated conversation. When her knocking brought no response she rattled the
   knob as loudly as possible, but still the voices argued on unheeding. They
   belonged, of course, to Surama and her brother; and as she stood there
   trying to attract attention she could not help catch something of their
   drift. Fate had made her for the second time an eavesdropper, and once
   more the matter she overheard seemed likely to tax her mental poise and
   nervous endurance to their ultimate bounds. Alfred and Surama were plainly
   quarrelling with increasing violence, and the purport of their speech was
   enough to arouse the wildest fears and confirm the gravest apprehensions.
   Georgina shivered as her brother's voice mounted shrilly to dangerous
   heights of fanatical tension.

   "You, damn you - you're a fine one to talk defeat and moderation to me!
   Who started all this, anyway? Did I have any idea of your cursed
   devil-gods and elder world? Did I ever in my life think of your damned
   spaces beyond the stars and your crawling chaos Nyarlathotep? I was a
   normal scientific man, confound you, till I was fool enough to drag you
   out of the vaults with your devilish Atlantean secrets. You egged me on,
   and now you want to cut me off! You loaf around doing nothing and telling
   me to go slow when you might just as well as not be going out and getting
   material. You know damn well that I don't know hot to go about such
   things, whereas you must have been an old hand at it before the earth was
   made. It's like you, you damned walking corpse, to start something you
   won't or can't finish!"

   Surama's evil chuckle came.

   "You're insane, Clarendon. That's the only reason I let you rave on when I
   could send you to hell in three minutes. Enough is enough, and you've
   certainly had enough material for any novice at your stage. You've had all
   I'm going to get you, anyhow! You're only a maniac on the subject now -
   what a cheap, crazy thing to sacrifice even your poor sister's pet dog,
   when you could have spared him as well as not! You can't look at any
   living thing without wanting to jab that gold syringe into it. No - Dick
   had to go where the Mexican boy went - where Tsanpo and the other seven
   went - where all the animals went! What a pupil! You're no fun any more -
   you've lost your nerve. You set out to control things, and they're
   controlling you. I'm about done with you, Clarendon. I thought you had the
   stuff in you, but you haven't. It's about time I tried somebody else. I'm
   afraid you'll have to go!"

   In the doctor's shouted reply there was both fear and frenzy.

   "Be careful, you - - ! There are powers against your powers - I didn't go
   to China for nothing, and there are things in Alhazred's Azif which
   weren't known in Atlantis! We've both meddled in dangerous things, but you
   needn't think you know all my resources. How about the Nemesis of Flame? I
   talked in Yemen with an old man who had come back alive from the Crimson
   Desert - he had seen Irem, the City of Pillars, and had worshipped at the
   underground shrines of Nug and Yeb - Ia! Shub-Niggurath!"

   Through Clarendon's shrieking falsetto cut the deep chuckle of the
   clinic-man.

   "Shut up, you fool! Do you suppose your grotesque nonsense has any weight
   with me? Words and formulae - words and formulae - what do they all mean
   to one who has the substance behind them? We're in a material sphere now,
   and subject to material laws. You have your fever; I have my revolver.
   You'll get no specimens and I'll get no fever so long as I have you in
   front of me with this gun between!"

   That was all Georgina could hear. She felt her senses reeling, and
   staggered out of the vestibule for a saving breath of the lowering outside
   air. She that the crisis had come at last, and that help must now arrive
   quickly if her brother was to be saved from the unknown gulfs of madness
   and mystery. Summoning up all her reserve energy, she managed to reach the
   house and get to the library, where she scrawled a hasty note for
   Margarita to take to James Dalton.

   When the old woman had gone, Georgina had just strength enough to cross to
   the lounge and sink weakly down into a sort of semi-stupor. There she lay
   for what seemed like years, conscious only of the fantastic creeping up of
   the twilight from the lower corners of the great, dismal room, and plagued
   by a thousand shadowy shapes of terror which filed with phantasmal,
   half-limned pageantry through her tortured and stifled brain. Dusk
   deepened into darkness, and still the spell held. Then a firm tread
   sounded in the hall, and she heard someone enter the room and fumble at
   the match-safe. Her heart almost stopped beating as the gas-jets of the
   chandelier flared up one by one, but then she saw that the arrival was her
   brother. Relieved to the bottom of her heart that he was still alive, she
   gave vent to an involuntary sigh, profound, long-drawn, and tremulous, and
   lapsed at last into kindly oblivion.

   At the sound of that sigh Clarendon turned in alarm toward the lounge, and
   was inexpressibly shocked to see the pale and unconscious form of his
   sister there. Her face had a death-like quality that frightened his inmost
   spirit, and he flung himself on his knees by her side, awake to a
   realisation of what her passing away would mean to him. Long unused to
   private practice amidst his ceaseless quest for truth, he had lost the
   physician's instinct of first aid, and could only call out her name and
   chafe her wrists mechanically as fear and grief possessed him. Then he
   thought of water, and ran to the dining-room for a carafe. Stumbling about
   in a darkness which seemed to harbour vague terrors, he was some time in
   finding what he sought; but at last he clutched it in shaking hand and
   hastened back to dash the cold fluid in Georgina's face. The method was
   crude but effective. She stirred, sighed a second time, and finally opened
   her eyes.

   "You are alive!" he cried, and put his cheek to hers as she stroked his
   head maternally. She was almost glad she fainted, for the circumstance
   seemed to have dispelled the strange Alfred and brought her own brother
   back to her. She sat up slowly and tried to reassure him.

   "I'm all right, Al. just give me a glass of water. It's a sin to waste it
   this way - to say nothing of spoiling my waist! Is that the way to behave
   every time your sister drops off for a nap? You needn't think I'm going to
   be sick, for I haven't time for such nonsense!"

   Alfred's eyes shewed that her cool, common-sense speech had had its
   effect. His brotherly panic dissolved in an instant, and instead there
   came into his face a vague, calculating expression, as if some marvellous
   possibility had just dawned upon him. As she watched the subtle waves of
   cunning and appraisal pass fleetingly over his countenance she became less
   and less certain that her mode of reassurance had been a wise one, and
   before he spoke she found herself shivering at something she could not
   define. A keen medical instinct almost told her that his moment of sanity
   had passed, and that he was now once more the unrestrained fanatic for
   scientific research. There was something morbid in the quick narrowing of
   his eyes at her casual mention of good health. What was he thinking? To
   what unnatural extreme was his passion for experiment about to be pushed?
   Wherein lay the special significance of her pure blood and absolutely
   flawless organic state? None of these misgivings, however, troubled
   Georgina for more than a second, and she was quite natural and
   unsuspicious as she felt her brother's steady fingers at her pulse.

   "You're a bit feverish, Georgina," he said in a precise, elaborately
   restrained voice as he looked professionally into her eyes.

   "Why, nonsense, I'm all right," she replied. "One would think you were on
   the watch for fever patients just for the sake of showing off your
   discovery! It would be poetic, though, if you could your final proof and
   demonstration by curing your own sister!"

   Clarendon started violently and guiltily. Had she suspected his wish? Had
   he muttered anything aloud? He looked at her closely, and saw that she had
   no inkling of the truth. She smiled up sweetly into his face and patted
   his hand as he stood by the side of the lounge. Then he took a small
   oblong leather case from his vest pocket, and taking out a little gold
   syringe, he began fingering it thoughtfully, pushing the piston
   speculatively in and out of the empty cylinder.

   "I wonder," he began with suave sententiousness, "whether you would really
   be willing to help science in - something like that way - if the need
   arose? Whether you would have the devotion to offer yourself to the cause
   of medicine as a sort of Jephthah's daughter if you knew it meant the
   absolute perfection and completion of my work?"

   Georgina, catching the odd and unmistakable glitter in her brother's eyes,
   knew at last that her worst fears were true. There was nothing to now but
   keep him quiet at all hazards and to pray that Margarita had found James
   Dalton at his club.

   "You look tired, Al dear," she said gently. "Why not take a little morphia
   and get some of the sleep you need so badly?"

   He replied with a kind of crafty deliberation.

   "Yes, you're right. I'm worn out, and so are you. Each of us needs a good
   sleep. Morphine is just the thing - wait till I go and fill the syringe
   and we'll both take a proper dose."

   Still fingering the empty syringe, he walked softly out of the room.
   Georgina looked about her with the aimlessness of desperation, ears alert
   for any sign of possible help. She thought she heard Margarita again in
   the basement kitchen, and rose to ring the bell, in an effort to learn of
   the fate of her message. The old servant answered her summons at once, and
   declared she had given the message at the club hours ago. Governor Dalton
   had been out, but the clerk had promised to deliver the note at the very
   moment of his arrival.

   Margarita waddled below stairs again, but still Clarendon did not
   reappear. What was he doing? What was he planning? She had heard the outer
   door slam, so knew he must be at the clinic. Had he forgotten his original
   intention with the vacillating mind of madness? The suspense grew almost
   unbearable, and Georgina had to keep her teeth clenched tightly to avoid
   screaming.

   It was the gate bell, which rang simultaneously in house and clinic, that
   broke the tension at last. She heard the cat-like tread of Surama on the
   walk as he left the clinic to answer it; and the, with an almost
   hysterical sigh, she caught the firm, familiar accents of Dalton in
   conversation with the sinister attendant. Rising, she almost tottered to
   meet him as he loomed up in the library doorway; and for a moment no word
   was spoken while he kissed her hand in his courtly, old school fashion.
   Then Georgina burst forth into a torrent of hurried explanation, telling
   all that had happened, all she had glimpsed and overheard, and all she
   feared and suspected.

   Dalton listened gravely and comprehendingly, his first bewilderment
   gradually giving place to astonishment, sympathy, and resolution. The
   message, held by a careless clerk, had been slightly delayed, and had
   found him appropriately enough in the midst of a warm lounging-room
   discussion about Clarendon. A fellow-member, Dr. MacNeil, had brought in a
   medical journal with an article well calculated to disturb the devoted
   scientist, and Dalton had just asked to keep the paper for future
   reference when the message was handed him at last. Abandoning his
   half-formed plan to take Dr. MacNeil into his confidence regarding Alfred,
   he called at once for his hat and stick, and lost not a moment in getting
   a cab for the Clarendon home.

   Surama, he thought, appeared alarmed at recognising him; though he had
   chuckled as usual when striding off again toward the clinic. Dalton always
   recalled Surama's stride and chuckle on this ominous night, for he was
   never to see the unearthly creature again. As the chuckler entered the
   clinic vestibule his deep, guttural gurgles seemed to blend with some low
   mutterings of thunder which troubled the far horizon.

   When Dalton had heard all Georgina had to say, and learned that Alfred was
   expected back at any moment with an hypodermic dose of morphine, he
   decided he had better talk with the doctor alone. Advising Georgina to
   retire to her room and await developments, he walked about the gloomy
   library, scanning the shelves and listening for Clarendon's nervous
   footstep on the clinic path outside. The vast room's corners were dismal
   despite the chandelier, and the closer Dalton looked at his friend's
   choice of books the less he liked them. It was not the balanced collection
   of a normal physician, biologist, or man of general culture. There were
   too many volumes on doubtful borderland themes; dark speculations and
   forbidden rituals of the Middle Ages, and strange exotic mysteries in
   alien alphabets both known and unknown.

   The great notebook of observations on the table was unwholesome, too. The
   handwriting had a neurotic cast, and the spirit of the entries was far
   from reassuring. Long passages were inscribed in crabbed Greek characters,
   and as Dalton marshaled his linguistic memory for their translation he
   gave a sudden start, and wished his college struggles with Xenophon and
   Homer had been more conscientious. There was something wrong - something
   hideously wrong - here, and the governor sank limply into the chair by the
   table as he pored more and more closely over the doctor's barbarous Greek.
   Then a sound came, startlingly near, and he jumped nervously at a hand
   laid sharply on his shoulder.

   "What, may I ask, is the cause of this intrusion? You might have stated
   your business to Surama."

   Clarendon was standing icily by the chair, the little gold syringe in one
   hand. He seemed very calm and rational, and Dalton fancied for a moment
   that Georgina must have exaggerated his condition. How, too, could a rusty
   scholar be absolutely sure about these Greek entries? The governor decided
   to be very cautious in his interview, and thanked the lucky chance which
   had a specious pretext in his coat pocket. He was very cool and assured as
   he rose to reply.

   "I didn't think you'd care to have things dragged before a subordinate,
   but I thought you ought to see this article at once."

   He drew forth the magazine given him by Dr. MacNeil and handed it to
   Clarendon.

   "On page 542 - you see the heading, 'Black Fever Conquered by New Serum.'
   It's by Dr. Miller of Philadelphia - and he thinks he's got ahead of you
   with your cure. They were discussing it at the club, and MacNeil thought
   the exposition very convincing. I, as a layman, couldn't pretend to judge;
   but at all events I thought you oughtn't to miss a chance to digest the
   thing while it's fresh. If you're busy, of course, I won't disturb you - "

   Clarendon cut in sharply.

   "I'm going to give my sister an hypodermic - she's not quite well - but
   I'll look at what that quack has to say when I get back. I know Miller - a
   damn sneak and incompetent - and I don't believe he has the brains to
   steal my methods from the little he's seen of them."

   Dalton suddenly felt a wave of intuition warning him that Georgina must
   not receive that intended dose. There was something sinister about it.
   From what she had said, Alfred must have been inordinately long preparing
   it, far longer than was needed for the dissolving of a morphine tablet. He
   decided to hold his host as long as possible, meanwhile testing his
   attitude in a more or less subtle way.

   "I'm sorry Georgina isn't well. Are you sure that the injection will do
   her good? That it won't do her any harm?"

   Clarendon's spasmodic start shewed that something had been struck home.

   "Do her harm?" he cried. "Don't be absurd! You know Georgina must be in
   the best of health - the very best, I say - in order to serve science as a
   Clarendon should serve it. She, at least, appreciates the fact that she is
   my sister. She deems no sacrifice too great in my service. She is a
   priestess of truth and discovery, as I am a priest."

   He paused in his shrill tirade, wild-eyed, and somewhat out of breath.
   Dalton could see that his attention had been momentarily shifted.

   "But let me see what this cursed quack has to say," he continued. "If he
   thinks his pseudo-medical rhetoric can take a real doctor in, he is even
   simpler than I thought!"

   Clarendon nervously found the right page and began reading as he stood
   there clutching his syringe. Dalton wondered what the real facts were.
   MacNeil had assured him that the author was a pathologist of the highest
   standing, and that whatever errors the article might have, the mind behind
   it was powerful, erudite, and absolutely honourable and sincere.

   Watching the doctor as he read, Dalton saw the thin, bearded face grow
   pale. The great eyes blazed, and the pages crackled in the tenser grip of
   the long, lean fingers. A perspiration broke out on the high, ivory-white
   forehead where the hair was already thinning, and the reader sank
   gaspingly into the chair his visitor had vacated as he kept on with his
   devouring of the tract. Then came a wild scream as from a haunted beast,
   and Clarendon lurched forward on the table, his outflung arms sweeping
   books and paper before them as consciousness went out like a wind-quenched
   candle-flame.

   Dalton, springing to help his stricken friend, raised the slim form and
   tilted it back in the chair. Seeing the carafe on the floor near the
   lounge, he dashed some water into the twisted face, and was rewarded by
   seeing the large eyes slowly open. They were sane eyes now - deep and sad
   and unmistakably sane - and Dalton felt awed in the presence of a tragedy
   whose ultimate depth he could never hope or dare to plumb.

   The golden hypodermic was still clutched in the lean left hand, and as
   Clarendon drew a deep, shuddering breath he unclosed his fingers and
   studied the glittering thing that rolled about on his palm. Then he spoke
   - slowly, and with the ineffable sadness of utter, absolute despair.

   "Thanks, Jimmy, I'm quite all right. But there's much to be done. You
   asked me a while back if this shot of morphia would do Georgie any harm.
   I'm in a position now to tell you that it won't."

   He turned a small screw in the syringe and laid a finger on the piston, at
   the same time pulling with his left hand at the skin of his own neck.
   Dalton cried out in alarm as a lightning motion of his right hand injected
   the contents of the cylinder into the ridge of distended flesh.

   "Good Lord, Al, what have you done?"

   Clarendon smiled gently - a smile almost of peace and resignation,
   different indeed from the sardonic sneer of the past few weeks.

   "You ought to know, Jimmy, if you've still the judgment that made you a
   governor. You must have pieced together enough from my notes to realise
   that there's nothing else to do. With your marks in Greek back at Columbia
   I guess you couldn't have missed much. All I can say is that it's true.

   "James, I don't like to pass blame along, but it's only right to tell you
   that Surama got me into this. I can't tell you who or what he is, for I
   don't fully know myself, and what I do know is stuff that no sane person
   ought to know; but I will say that I don't consider him a human being in
   the fullest sense, and that I'm not sure whether or not he's alive as we
   know life.

   "You think I'm talking nonsense. I wish I were, but the whole hideous mess
   is damnably real. I started out in life with a clean mind and purpose. I
   wanted to rid the world of fever. I tried and failed - and I wish to God I
   had been honest enough to say that I'd failed. Don't let my old talk of
   science deceive you, James - I found no antitoxin and was never even half
   on the track of one!

   "Don't look so shaken up, old fellow! A veteran politician-fighter like
   you must have seen plenty of unmaskings before. I tell you, I never even
   had the start of a fever cure. But my studies had taken me into some queer
   places, and it was just my damned luck to listen to the stories of some
   still queerer people. James, if you ever wish any man well, tell him to
   keep clear of the ancient, hidden places of the earth. Old backwaters are
   dangerous - things are handed down there that don't do healthy people any
   good. I talked too much with old priests and mystics, and got to hoping I
   might achieve things in dark ways that I couldn't achieve in lawful ways.

   "I shan't tell you just what I mean, for if I did I'd be as bad as the old
   priests that were the ruin of me. All I need say is that after what I've
   learned I shudder at the thought of the world and what it's been through.
   The world is cursed old, James, and there have been whole chapters lived
   and closed before the dawn of our organic life and the geologic eras
   connected with it. It's an awful thought - whole forgotten cycles of
   evolution with beings and races and wisdom and diseases - all lived
   through and gone before the first amoeba ever stirred in the tropic seas
   geology tells us about.

   "I said gone, but I didn't quite mean that. It would have been better that
   way, but it wasn't quite so. In places traditions have kept on - I can't
   tell you how - and certain archaic life-forms have managed to struggle
   thinly down the aeons in hidden spots. There were cults, you know - bands
   of evil priests in lands now buried under the sea. Atlantis was the
   hotbed. That was a terrible place. If heaven is merciful, no one will ever
   drag up that horror from the deep.

   "It had a colony, though, that didn't sink; and when you get too
   confidential with one of the Tuareg priests in Africa, he's likely to tell
   you wild tales about it - tales that connect up with whispers you'll hear
   among the mad lamas and flighty yak-drivers on the secret table-lands of
   Asia. I'd heard all the common tales and whispers when I came on the big
   one. What that was, you'll never know - but it pertained to somebody or
   something that had come down from a blasphemously long time ago, and could
   be made to live again - or seem alive again - through certain processes
   that weren't very clear to the man who told me.

   "Now, James, in spite of my confessions about the fever, you know I'm not
   bad as a doctor. I plugged hard at medicine, and soaked up about as much
   as the next man - maybe a little more, because down there in the Hoggar
   country I did something no priest had ever been able to do. They led me
   blindfolded to a place that had been sealed up for generations - and I
   came back with Surama.

   "Easy, James! I know what you want to say. How does he know all he knows?
   - why does he speak English - or any other language, for that matter -
   without an accent? - why did he come away with me? - and all that. I can't
   tell you altogether, but I can say that he takes in ideas and images and
   impressions with something besides his brains and senses. He had a use for
   me and my science. He told me things, and opened up vistas. He taught me
   to worship ancient, primordial, and unholy gods, and mapped out a road to
   a terrible goal which I can't even hint to you. Don't press me, James -
   it's for the sake of your sanity and the world's sanity!

   "The creature is beyond all bounds. He's in league with the stars and all
   the forces of Nature. Don't think I'm still crazy, James - I swear to you
   I'm not! I've had too many glimpses to doubt. He gave me new pleasures
   that were forms of his palaeogean worship, and the greatest of those was
   the black fever.

   "God, James! Haven't you seen through the business by this time? Do you
   still believe the black fever came out of Thibet, and that I learned about
   it there? Use your brains, man! Look at Miller's article here! He's found
   a basic antitoxin that will end all fever within half a century, when
   other men learn how to modify it for the different forms. He's cut the
   ground of my youth from under me - done what I'd have given my life to do
   - taken the wind out of all the honest sails I ever flung to the breeze of
   science! Do you wonder his article gave me a turn? Do you wonder it shocks
   me out of my madness back to the old dreams of my youth? Too late! Too
   late! But not too late to save others!

   "I guess I'm rambling a bit now, old man. You know - the hypodermic. I
   asked you why you didn't tumble to the facts about black fever. How could
   you, though? Doesn't Miller say he's cured seven cases with his serum? A
   matter of diagnosis, James. He only thinks it is black fever. I can read
   between his lines. Here, old chap, on page 551, is the key to the whole
   thing. Read it again.

   "You see, don't you? The fever cases from the Pacific Coast didn't respond
   to his serum. They puzzled him. They didn't even seem like any true fever
   he knew. Well, those were my cases! Those were the real black fever cases!
   And there can't ever be an antitoxin on earth that'll cure black fever!

   "How do I know? Because black fever isn't of this earth! It's from
   somewhere else, James - and Surama alone knows where, because he brought
   it here. He brought it and I spread it! That's the secret, James! That's
   all I wanted the appointment for - that's all I ever did - just spread the
   fever that I carried in the gold syringe and in the deadlier
   finger-ring-pump-syringe you see on my index finger! Science? A blind! I
   wanted to kill, and kill, and kill! A single pressure on my finger, and
   the black fever was inoculated. I wanted to see living things writhe and
   squirm, scream and froth at the mouth. A single pressure of the
   pump-syringe and I could watch them as they died, and I couldn't live or
   think unless I had plenty to watch. That's why I jabbed everything in
   sight with the accursed hollow needle. Animals, criminals, children,
   servants - and the next would have been - "

   Clarendon's voice broke, and he crumpled up perceptibly in his chair.

   "That - that, James - was - my life. Surama made it so - he taught me, and
   kept me at it till I couldn't stop. Then - then it got too much even for
   him. He tried to check me. Fancy - he trying to check anybody in that
   line! But now I've got my last specimen. That is my last test. Good
   subject, James - I'm healthy - devilish healthy. Deuced ironic, though -
   the madness has gone now, so there won't be any fun watching the agony!
   Can't he - can't - "

   A violent shiver of fever racked the doctor, and Dalton mourned amidst his
   horror-stupefaction that he could give no grief. How much of Alfred's
   story was sheer nonsense, and how much nightmare truth he could not say;
   but in any case he felt that the man was a victim rather than a criminal,
   and above all, he was a boyhood comrade and Georgina's brother. Thoughts
   of the old days came back kaleidoscopically. 'Little Alf' - the yard at
   Phillips Exeter - the quadrangle at Columbia - the fight with Tom Cortland
   when he saved Alf from a pommeling...

   He helped Clarendon to the lounge and asked gently what he could do. There
   was nothing. Alfred could only whisper now, but he asked forgiveness for
   all his offences, and commended his sister to the care of his friend.

   "You - you'll - make her happy," he gasped. "She deserves it. Martyr - to
   - a myth! Make it up to her, James. Don't - let - her - know - more - than
   she has to!"

   His voice trailed off in a mumble, and he fell into a stupor. Dalton rang
   the bell, but Margarita had gone to bed, so he called up the stairs for
   Georgina. She was firm of step, but very pale. Alfred's scream had tried
   her sorely, but she trusted James. She trusted him still as he shewed her
   the unconscious form on the lounge and asked to her go back to her room
   and rest, no matter what sounds she might hear. He did not wish her to
   witness the spectacle of delirium certain to come, but bade her kiss her
   brother a final farewell as he lay there calm and still, very like the
   delicate boy he had once been. So she left him - the strange, moonstruck,
   star-reading genius she had mothered so long - and the picture she carried
   away was a very merciful one.

   Dalton must bear to his grave a sterner picture. His fears of delirium
   were not vain, and all through the black midnight hours his giant strength
   restrained the fearful contortion of the mad sufferer. What he heard from
   those swollen, blackening lips he will never repeat. He has never been
   quite the same man since, and he knows that no one who hears such things
   can ever be wholly as he was before. So, for the world's good, he dares
   not speak, and he thanks God that his layman's ignorance of certain
   subjects makes many of the revelations cryptic and meaningless to him.

   Toward morning Clarendon suddenly woke to a sane consciousness and began
   to speak in a firm voice.

   "James, I didn't tell you what must be done - about everything. Blot out
   those entries in Greek and send my notebook to Dr. Miller. All my other
   notes, too, that you'll find in the files. He's the big authority today -
   his article proves it. Your friend at the club was right.

   "But everything in the clinic must go. Everything without exception, dead
   or alive or - otherwise. All the plagues of hell are in those bottles on
   the shelves. Burn them - burn it all - if one thing escapes, Surama will
   spread black death throughout the world. And above all burn Surama! That -
   that thing - must not breathe the wholesome air of heaven. You know now -
   what I told you - why such an entity can't be allowed on earth. It won't
   be murder - Surama isn't human - if you're as pious as you used to be,
   James, I shan't have to urge you. Remember the old text - 'Thou shalt not
   suffer a witch to live' - or something of the sort.

   "Burn him, James! Don't let him chuckle again over the torture of mortal
   flesh! I say, burn him - the Nemesis of Flame - that's all that can reach
   him, James, unless you catch him asleep and drive a wooden stake through
   his heart... Kill him - extirpate him - cleanse the decent universe of its
   primal taint - the taint I recalled from its age-long sleep... "

   The doctor had risen on his elbow, and his voice was a piercing shriek
   toward the last. The effort was too much, however, and he lapsed very
   suddenly into a deep, tranquil coma. Dalton, himself fearless of fever,
   since he knew the dread germ to be non-contagious, composed Alfred's arms
   and legs on the lounge and threw a light afghan over the fragile form.
   After all, mightn't much of this horror be exaggeration and delirium?
   Mightn't old Doc MacNeil pull him through on a long chance? The governor
   strove to keep awake, and walked briskly up and down the room, but his
   energies had been taxed too deeply for such measures. A second's rest in
   the chair by the table took matters out of his hands, and he was presently
   sleeping soundly despite his best intentions.

   Dalton started up as a fierce light shone in his eyes, and for a moment he
   thought the dawn had come. But it was not the dawn, and as he rubbed his
   heavy lids he saw that it was the glare of the burning clinic in the yard,
   whose stout planks flamed and roared and crackled heavenward in the most
   stupendous holocaust he had ever seen. It was indeed the "Nemesis of
   Flame" that Clarendon had wished, and Dalton felt that some strange
   combustibles must be involved in a blaze so much wilder than anything
   normal pine of redwood could afford. He glanced alarmedly at the lounge,
   but Alfred was not there. Starting up, he went to call Georgina, but met
   her in the hall, roused as he was by the mountain of living fire.

   "The clinic's burning down!" she cried. "How is Al now?"

   "He's disappeared - disappeared while I dropped asleep!" replied Dalton,
   reaching out a steadying arm to the form which faintness had begun to
   sway.

   Gently leading her upstairs toward her room, he promised to search at once
   for Alfred, but Georgina slowly shook her head as the flames from outside
   cast a weird glow through the window on the landing.

   "He must be dead, James - he could never live, sane and knowing what he
   did. I heard him quarrelling with Surama, and know that awful things were
   going on. He is my brother, but - it is best as it is."

   Her voice had sunk to a whisper.

   Suddenly through the open window came the sound of a deep, hideous
   chuckle, and the flames of the burning clinic took fresh contours till
   they half resembled some nameless, Cyclopean creatures of nightmare. James
   and Georgina paused hesitant, and peered out breathlessly through the
   landing window. Then from the sky came a thunderous peal, as a forked bolt
   of lightning shot down with terrible directness into the very midst of the
   blazing ruin. The deep chuckle ceased, and in its place came a frantic,
   ululant yelp of a thousand ghouls and werewolves in torment. It died away
   with long, reverberant echoes, and slowly the flames resumed their normal
   shape.

   The watchers did not move, but waited till the pillar of fire had shrunk
   to a smouldering glow. They were glad of a half-rusticity which had kept
   the firemen from trooping out, and of the wall that excluded the curious.
   What had happened was not for vulgar eyes - it involved too much of the
   universe's inner secrets for that.

   In the pale dawn, James spoke softly to Georgina, who could do no more
   than put her head on his breast and sob.

   "Sweetheart, I think he has atoned. He must have set the fire, you know,
   while I was asleep. He told me it ought to be burned - the clinic, and
   everything in it, Surama, too. It was the only way to save the world from
   the unknown horrors he had loosed upon it. He knew, and he did what was
   best.

   "He was a great man, Georgie. Let's never forget that. We must always be
   proud of him, for he started out to help mankind, and was titanic even in
   his sins. I'll tell you more sometime. What he did, be it good or evil,
   was what no man ever did before. He was the first and last to break
   through certain veils, and even Apollonius of Tyana takes second place
   beside him. But we mustn't talk about that. We must remember him only as
   the Little Alf we knew - as the boy who wanted to master medicine and
   conquer fever."

   In the afternoon the leisurely firemen overhauled the ruins and found two
   skeletons with bits of blackened flesh adhering - only two, thanks to the
   undisturbed lime-pits. One was of a man; the other is still a subject of
   debate among the biologists of the coast. It was not exactly an ape's or a
   saurian's skeleton, but it had disturbing suggestions of lines of
   evolution of which palaeontology has revealed no trace. The charred skull,
   oddly enough, was human, and reminded people of Surama, but the rest of
   the bones were beyond conjecture. Only well-cut clothing could have made
   such a body look like a man.

   But the human bones were Clarendon's. No one disputed this, and the world
   at large still mourns the untimely death of the greatest doctor of his
   age; the bacteriologist whose universal fever serum would have far
   eclipsed Dr. Miller's kindred antitoxin had he lived to bring it to
   perfection. Much of Miller's late success, indeed, is credited to the
   notes bequeathed him by the hapless victim of the flames. Of the old
   rivalry and hatred almost none survived, and even Dr. Wilfred Jones has
   been known to boast of his association with the vanished leader.

   James Dalton and his wife Georgina have always preserved a reticence which
   modesty and family grief might well account for. They published certain
   notes as a tribute to the great man's memory, but have never confirmed or
   contradicted either the popular estimate or the rare hints of marvels that
   a very few keen thinkers have been to whisper. It was very subtly and
   slowly that the facts filtered out. Dalton probably gave Dr. MacNeil an
   inkling of the truth, and that good soul had not many secrets from his
   son.

   The Daltons have led, on the whole, a very happy life, for their cloud of
   terror lies far in the background, and a strong mutual love has kept the
   world fresh for them. But there are things which disturb them oddly -
   little things, of which one would scarcely ever think of complaining. They
   cannot bear persons who are lean or deep-voiced beyond certain limits, and
   Georgina turns pale at the sound of any guttural chuckling. Senator Dalton
   has a mixed horror of occultism, travel, hypodermics, and strange
   alphabets which most find hard to unify, and there are still those who
   blame him for the vast proportion of the doctor's library that he
   destroyed with such painstaking completeness.

   MacNeil, though, seemed to realise. He was a simple man, and he said a
   prayer as the last of Alfred Clarendon's strange books crumbled to ashes.
   Nor would anyone who had peered understandingly within those books wish a
   word of that prayer unsaid.
