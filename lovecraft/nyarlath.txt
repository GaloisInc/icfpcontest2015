   Nyarlathotep... the crawling chaos... I am the last... I will tell the
   audient void...

   I do not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months ago. The
   general tension was horrible. To a season of political and social upheaval
   was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger;
   a danger widespread and all-embracing, such a danger as may be imagined
   only in the most terrible phantasms of the night. I recall that the people
   went about with pale and worried faces, and whispered warnings and
   prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself
   that he had heard. A sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out
   of the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver
   in dark and lonely places. There was a demoniac alteration in the sequence
   of the seasons the autumn heat lingered fearsomely, and everyone felt that
   the world and perhaps the universe had passed from the control of known
   gods or forces to that of gods or forces which were unknown.

   And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none
   could tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh.
   The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he
   had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he
   had heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the lands of
   civilisation came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always
   buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into
   instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the sciences of electricity and
   psychology and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away
   speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude. Men advised
   one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep
   went, rest vanished, for the small hours were rent with the screams of
   nightmare. Never before had the screams of nightmare been such a public
   problem; now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the
   small hours, that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the
   pale, pitying moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges,
   and old steeples crumbling against a sickly sky.

   I remember when Nyarlathotep came to my city the great, the old, the
   terrible city of unnumbered crimes. My friend had told me of him, and of
   the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations, and I burned
   with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries. My friend said they
   were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings; and what
   was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but
   Nyarlathotep dared prophesy, and in the sputter of his sparks there was
   taken from men that which had never been taken before yet which shewed
   only in the eyes. And I heard it hinted abroad that those who knew
   Nyarlathotep looked on sights which others saw not.

   It was in the hot autumn that I went through the night with the restless
   crowds to see Nyarlathotep; through the stifling night and up the endless
   stairs into the choking room. And shadowed on a screen, I saw hooded forms
   amidst ruins, and yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments.
   And I saw the world battling against blackness; against the waves of
   destruction from ultimate space; whirling, churning, struggling around the
   dimming, cooling sun. Then the sparks played amazingly around the heads of
   the spectators, and hair stood up on end whilst shadows more grotesque
   than I can tell came out and squatted on the heads. And when I, who was
   colder and more scientific than the rest, mumbled a trembling protest
   about imposture and static electricity, Nyarlathotep drove us all out,
   down the dizzy stairs into the damp, hot, deserted midnight streets. I
   screamed aloud that I was not afraid; that I never could be afraid; and
   others screamed with me for solace. We swore to one another that the city
   was exactly the same, and still alive; and when the electric lights began
   to fade we cursed the company over and over again, and laughed at the
   queer faces we made.

   I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when
   we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary
   marching formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared
   not think of them. Once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks
   loose and displaced by grass, with scarce a line of rusted metal to shew
   where the tramways had run. And again we saw a tram-car, lone, windowless,
   dilapidated, and almost on its side. When we gazed around the horizon, we
   could not find the third tower by the river, and noticed that the
   silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top. Then we split up
   into narrow columns, each of which seemed drawn in a different direction.
   One disappeared in a narrow alley to the left, leaving only the echo of a
   shocking moan. Another filed down a weed-choked subway entrance, howling
   with a laughter that was mad. My own column was sucked toward the open
   country, and presently I felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn; for
   as we stalked out on the dark moor, we beheld around us the hellish
   moon-glitter of evil snows. Trackless, inexplicable snows, swept asunder
   in one direction only, where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering
   walls. The column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the
   gulf. I lingered behind, for the black rift in the green-litten snow was
   frightful, and I thought I had heard the reverberations of a disquieting
   wail as my companions vanished; but my power to linger was slight. As if
   beckoned by those who had gone before, I half-floated between the titanic
   snowdrifts, quivering and afraid, into the sightless vortex of the
   unimaginable.

   Screamingly sentient, dumbly delirious, only the gods that were can tell.
   A sickened, sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands, and
   whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation, corpses of
   dead worlds with sores that were cities, charnel winds that brush the
   pallid stars and make them flicker low. Beyond the worlds vague ghosts of
   monstrous things; half-seen columns of unsanctifled temples that rest on
   nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres
   of light and darkness. And through this revolting graveyard of the
   universe the muffled, maddening beating of drums, and thin, monotonous
   whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond
   Time; the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly,
   awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic, tenebrous ultimate gods the blind,
   voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul is Nyarlathotep.

   NOTE: Nyarlathotep appeared in the November issue the United Amateur, but
   as that publication was often several months late, it is not clear exactly
   when the story actually saw print. Rheinhart Kleiner had read it by
   December 1920, though it is not certain whether he had read it in the
   United Amateur, or HPL had mailed him a copy of the manuscript.
