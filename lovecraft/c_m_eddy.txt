     I noiticed on your website you have some works by C.M. Eddy, Jr. The
     Loved Dead, The Ghosteater, Ashes, and Deaf, Dumb, and Blind. These
     stories were written by my grandfather. These stories are not in the
     public domain, my grandfather retained the rights to them after they
     were published in Weird Tales. Upon my grandfathers death in 1967 and
     grandmothers death in 1978 the rights were inherited by my mother and
     aunt. I am writing this on their behalf. I would ask that you honor this
     under the copyright law. If you have any questions feel free to get in
     touch with me. Thank you.

                                                                     Jim Dyer

   In accordance with the request of Jim Dyer, C. M. Eddy's grandson, the
   above mentioned stories have been removed from this site.
