   [C. L. Moore]

   George Campbell opened sleep-fogged eyes upon darkness and lay gazing out
   of the tent flap upon the pale August night for some minutes before he
   roused enough even to wonder what had wakened him. There was in the keen,
   clear air of these Canadian woods a soporific as potent as any drug.
   Campbell lay quiet for a moment, sinking slowly back into the delicious
   borderlands of sleep, conscious of an exquisite weariness, an unaccustomed
   sense of muscles well used, and relaxed now into perfect ease. These were
   vacation's most delightful moments, after all -- rest, after toil, in the
   clear, sweet forest night.

   Luxuriously, as his mind sank backward into oblivion, he assured himself
   once more that three long months of freedom lay before him -- freedom from
   cities and monotony, freedom from pedagogy and the University and students
   with no rudiments of interest in the geology he earned his daily bread by
   dinning Into their obdurate ears. Freedom from --

   Abruptly the delightful somnolence crashed about him. Somewhere outside
   the sound of tin shrieking across tin slashed into his peace. George
   Campbell sat up jerkily and reached for his flashlight. Then he laughed
   and put it down again, straining his eyes through the midnight gloom
   outside where among the tumbling cans of his supplies a dark anonymous
   little night beast was prowling. He stretched out a long arm and groped
   about among the rocks at the tent door for a missile. His fingers closed
   on a large stone, and he drew back his hand to throw.

   But he never threw it. It was such a queer thing he had come upon in the
   dark. Square, crystal smooth, obviously artificial, with dull rounded
   corners. The strangeness of its rock surfaces to his fingers was so
   remarkable that he reached again for his flashlight and turned its rays
   upon the thing he held.

   All sleepiness left him as he saw what it was he had picked up in his idle
   groping. It was clear as rock crystal, this queer, smooth cube. Quartz,
   unquestionably, but not in its usual hexagonal crystallized form. Somehow
   -- he could not guess the method -- it had been wrought into a perfect
   cube, about four inches in measurement over each worn face. For it was
   incredibly worn. The hard, hard crystal was rounded now until its corners
   were almost gone and the thing was beginning to assume the outlines of a
   sphere. Ages and ages of wearing, years almost beyond counting, must have
   passed over this strange clear thing.

   But the most curious thing of all was that shape he could make out dimly
   in the heart of the crystal. For imbedded in its center lay a little disc
   of a pale and nameless substance with characters incised deep upon its
   quartz-enclosed surface. Wedge-shaped characters, faintly reminiscent of
   cuneiform writing.

   George Campbell wrinkled his brows and bent closer above the little enigma
   in his hands, puzzling helplessly. How could such a thing as this have
   imbedded in pure rock crystal? Remotely a memory floated through his mind
   of ancient legends that called quartz crystals ice which had frozen too
   hard to melt again. Ice -- and wedge-shaped cuneiforms -- yes, didn't that
   sort of writing originate among the Sumerians who came down from the north
   in history's remotest beginnings to settle in the primitive Mesopotamian
   valley? Then hard sense regained control and he laughed. Quartz, of
   course, was formed in the earliest of earth's geological periods, when
   there was nothing anywhere but beat and heaving rock. Ice had not come for
   tens of millions of years after this thing must have been formed.

   And yet -- that writing. Man-made, surely, although its characters were
   unfamiliar save in their faint hinting at cuneiform shapes. Or could
   there, In a Paleozoic world, have been things with a written language who
   might have graven these cryptic wedges upon the quartz-enveloped disc he
   held? Or -- might a thing like this have fallen meteor-like out of space
   into the unformed rock of a still molten world? Could it --

   Then he caught himself up sharply and felt his ears going hot at the
   luridness of his own imagination. The silence and the solitude and the
   queer thing in his hands were conspiring to play tricks with his common
   sense. He shrugged and laid the crystal down at the edge of his pallet,
   switching off the light. Perhaps morning and a clear head would bring him
   an answer to the questions that seemed so insoluble now.

   But sleep did not come easily. For one thing, it seemed to him as he
   flashed off the light, that the little cube had shone for a moment as if
   with sustained light before it faded into the surrounding dark. Or perhaps
   he was wrong. Perhaps It had been only his dazzled eyes that seemed to see
   the light forsake it reluctantly, glowing In the enigmatic deeps of the
   thing with queer persistence.

   He lay there unquietly for a long while, turning the unanswered questions
   over and over in his mind. There was something about this crystal cube out
   of the unmeasured past, perhaps from the dawn of all history, that
   constituted a challenge that would not let him sleep.

   [A. Merritt]

   He lay there, it seemed to him, for hours. It had been the lingering
   light, the luminescence that seemed so reluctant to die, which held his
   mind. It was as though something in the heart of the cube had awakened,
   stirred drowsily, become suddenly alert ... and Intent upon him.

   Sheer fantasy, this. He stirred impatiently and flashed his light upon his
   watch. Close to one o'clock; three hours more before the dawn. The beam
   fell and was focused upon the warm crystal cube. He held it there closely,
   for minutes. He snapped It out, then watched.

   There was no doubt about it now. As his eyes accustomed themselves to the
   darkness, he saw that the strange crystal was glimmering with tiny
   fugitive lights deep within it like threads of sapphire lightnings. They
   were at Its center and they seemed to him to come from the pale disk with
   Its disturbing markings. And the disc itself was becoming larger ... the
   markings shifting shapes ... the cube was growing ... was it illusion
   brought about by the tiny lightnings....

   He heard a sound. It was the very ghost of a sound, like the ghosts of
   harp strings being plucked with ghostly fingers. He bent closer. It came
   from the cube....

   There was squeaking in the underbrush, a flurry of bodies and an agonized
   wailing like a child in death throes and swiftly stilled. Some small
   tragedy of the wilderness, killer and prey. He stepped over to where it
   had been enacted, but could see nothing. He again snapped off the flash
   and looked toward his tent. Upon the ground was a pale blue glimmering. It
   was the cube. He stooped to pick it up; then obeying some obscure warning,
   drew back his hand.

   And again, he saw, its glow was dying. The tiny sapphire lightnings
   flashing fitfully, withdrawing to the disc from which they had come. There
   was no sound from it.

   He sat, watching the luminescence glow and fade, glow and fade, but
   steadily becoming dimmer. It came to him that two elements were necessary
   to produce the phenomenon. The electric ray itself, and his own fixed
   attention. His mind must travel along the ray, fix itself upon the cube's
   heart, if its beat were to wax, until ... what?

   He felt a chill of spirit, as though from contact with some alien thing.
   It was alien, he knew it; not of this earth. Not of earth's life. He
   conquered his shrinking, picked up the cube and took It into the tent. It
   was neither warm nor cold; except for its weight he would not have known
   he held it. He put it upon the table, keeping the torch turned from it;
   then stepped to the flap of the tent and closed it.

   He went back to the table, drew up the camp chair, and turned the flash
   directly upon the cube, focusing it so far as he could upon its heart. He
   sent all his will, all his concentration, along it; focusing will and
   sight upon the disc as he had the light.

   As though at command, the sapphire lightnings burned forth. They burst
   from the disc into the body of the crystal cube, then beat back, bathing
   the disc and the markings. Again these began to change, shifting, moving,
   advancing, and retreating in the blue gleaming. They were no longer
   cuneiform. They were things ... objects.

   He heard the murmuring music, the plucked harp strings. Louder grew the
   sound and louder, and now all the body of the cube vibrated to their
   rhythm. The crystal walls were melting, growing misty as though formed of
   the mist of diamonds. And the disc Itself was growing ... the shapes
   shifting, dividing and multiplying as though some door had been opened and
   Into it companies of phantasms were pouring. While brighter, more bright
   grew the pulsing light.

   He felt swift panic, tried to withdraw sight and will, dropped the flash.
   The cube had no need now of the ray ... and he could not withdraw ...
   could not withdraw? Why, he himself was being sucked into that disc which
   was now a globe within which unnameable shapes danced to a music that
   bathed the globe with steady radiance.

   There was no tent. There was only a vast curtain of sparkling mist behind
   which shone the globe.... He felt himself drawn through that mist, sucked
   through it as if by a mighty wind, straight for the globe.

   [H. P. Lovecraft]

   As the mist-blurred light of the sapphire suns grew more and more intense,
   the outlines of the globe ahead wavered and dissolved to a churning chaos.
   Its pallor and its motion and its music all blended themselves with the
   engulfing mist- bleaching It to a pale steel-colour and setting it
   undulantly in motion. And the sapphire suns, too, melted Imperceptibly
   into the greying infinity of shapeless pulsation.

   Meanwhile the sense of forward, outward motion grew intolerably,
   incredibly, cosmically swift. Every standard of speed known to earth
   seemed dwarfed, and Campbell knew that any such flight in physical reality
   would mean instant death to a human being. Even as it was -- in this
   strange, hellish hypnosis or nightmare -- the quasi-visual impression of
   meteor-like hurtling almost paralyzed his mind. Though there were no real
   points of reference in the grey, pulsing void, he felt that he was
   approaching and passing the speed of light Itself. Finally his
   consciousness did go under -- and merciful blackness swallowed everything.

   It was very suddenly, and amidst the most impenetrable darkness, that
   thoughts and Ideas again came to George Campbell. Of how many moments --
   or years -- or eternities -- had elapsed since his flight through the grey
   void, he could form no estimate. He knew only that he seemed to be at rest
   and without pain. Indeed, the absence of all physical sensation was the
   salient quality of his condition. It made even the blackness seem less
   solidly black -- suggesting as it did that he was rather a disembodied
   intelligence in a state beyond physical senses, than a corporeal being
   with senses deprived of their accustomed objects of perception. He could
   think sharply and quickly -- almost preternaturally so -- yet could form
   no idea whatsoever of his situation.

   Half by instinct, he realised that he was not in his own tent. True, he
   might have awaked there from a nightmare to a world equally black; yet he
   knew this was not so. There was no camp cot beneath him -- he had no hands
   to feel the blankets and canvas surface and flashlight that ought to be
   around him -- there was no sensation of cold in the air -- no flap through
   which he could glimpse the pale night outside ... something was wrong,
   dreadfully wrong.

   He cast his mind backward and thought of the fluorescent cube which had
   hypnotised him -- of that, and all which had followed. He had known that
   his mind was going, yet had been unable to draw back. At the last moment
   there had been a shocking, panic fear -- a subconscious fear beyond even
   that caused by the sensation of daemonic flight. It had come from some
   vague flash or remote recollection -- just what, he could not at once
   tell. Some cell-group In the back of his head had seemed to find a
   cloudily familiar quality In the cube -- and that familiarity was fraught
   with dim terror. Now he tried to remember what the familiarity and the
   terror were.

   Little by little it came to him. Once -- long ago, in connection with his
   geological life-work -- he had read of something like that cube. It had to
   do with those debatable and disquieting clay fragments called the Eltdown
   Shards, dug up from pre-carboniferous strata in southern England thirty
   years before. Their shape and markings were so queer that a few scholars
   hinted at artificiality, and made wild conjectures about them and their
   origin. They came, clearly, from a time when no human beings could exist
   on the globe -- but their contours and figurings were damnably puzzling.
   That was how they got their name.

   It was not, however, In the writings of any sober scientist that Campbell
   had seen that reference to a crystal, disc-holding globe. The source was
   far less reputable, and infinitely more vivid. About 1912 a deeply learned
   Sussex clergyman of occultist leanings -- the Reverend Arthur Brooke
   Winters-Hall -- had professed to Identify the markings on the Eltdown
   Shards with some of the so-called "pre-human hieroglyphs" persistently
   cherished and esoterically handed down in certain mystical circles, and
   had published at his own expense what purported to be a "translation" of
   the primal and baffling "inscriptions" -- a "translation" still quoted
   frequently and seriously by occult writers. In this "translation' -- a
   surprisingly long brochure In view of the limited number of "shards"
   existing -- had occurred the narrative, supposedly of pre-human
   authorship, containing the now frightening reference.

   As the story went, there dwelt on a world -- and eventually on countless
   other worlds -- of outer space a mighty order of worm-like beings whose
   attainments and whose control of nature surpassed anything within the
   range of terrestrial imagination. They had mastered the art of
   interstellar travel early in their career, and had peopled every habitable
   planet in their own galaxy - killing off the races they found.

   Beyond the limits of their own galaxy -- which was not ours -- they could
   not navigate in person; but in their quest for knowledge of all space and
   time they discovered a means of spanning certain transgalactic gulfs with
   their minds. They devised peculiar objects -- strangely energized cubes of
   a curious crystal containing hypnotic talismen and enclosed in
   space-resisting spherical envelopes of an unknown substance -- which could
   be forcibly expelled beyond the limits of their universe, and which would
   respond to the attraction of cool solid matter only.

   These, of which a few would necessarily land on various inhabited worlds
   in outside universes, formed the ether-bridges needed for mental
   communication. Atmospheric friction burned away the protecting envelope,
   leaving the cube exposed and subject to discovery by the intelligent minds
   of the world where it fell. By its very nature, the cube would attract and
   rivet attention. This, when coupled with the action of light, was
   sufficient to set its special properties working.

   The mind that noticed the cube would be drawn into it by the power of the
   disc, and would be sent on a thread of obscure energy to the place whence
   the disc had come -- the remote world of the worm-like spaceexplorers
   across stupendous galactic abysses. Received in one of the machines to
   which each cube was attuned, the captured mind would remain suspended
   without body or senses until examined by one of the dominant race. Then it
   would, by an obscure process of interchange, be pumped of all its
   contents. The investigator's mind would now occupy the strange machine
   while the captive mind occupied the interrogator's worm-like body. Then,
   in another interchange, the interrogator's mind would leap across
   boundless space to the captive's vacant and unconscious body on the
   trans-galactic world -- animating the alien tenement as best It might, and
   exploring the alien world in the guise of one of its denizens.

   When done with exploration, the adventurer would use the cube and its disc
   in accomplishing his return -- and sometimes the captured mind would be
   restored safely to its own remote world. Not always, however, was the
   dominant race so kind. Sometimes, when a potentially important race
   capable of space travel was found, the worm-like folk would employ the
   cube to capture and annihilate minds by the thousands, andwould extirpate
   the race for diplomatic reasons -- using the exploring minds as agents of
   destruction.

   In other cases sections of the worm-folk would permanently occupy a
   trans-galactic planet - destroying the captured minds and wiping out the
   remaining inhabitants preparatory to settling down in unfamiliar bodies.
   Never, however, could the parent civilization be quite duplicated In such
   a case; since the new planet would not contain all the materials necessary
   for the worm-race's arts. The cubes, for example, could be made only on
   the home planet.

   Only a few of the numberless cubes sent forth ever found a landing and
   response on an inhabited world - since there was no such thing as aiming
   them at goals beyond sight or knowledge. Only three, ran the story, had
   ever landed on peopled worlds in our own particular universe. One of these
   had struck a planet near the galactic rim two thousand billion years ago,
   while another had lodged three billion years ago on a world near the
   centre of the galaxy. The third -- and the only one ever known to have
   invaded the solar system -- had reached our own earth 150,000,000 years
   ago.

   It was with this latter that Dr. Winters-Hall's "translation" chiefly
   dealt. When the cube struck the earth, he wrote, the ruling terrestrial
   species was a huge, cone-shaped race surpassing all others before or since
   In mentality and achievements. This race was so advanced that it had
   actually sent minds abroad in both space and time to explore the cosmos,
   hence recognised something of what had happened when the cube fell from
   the sky and certain Individuals had suffered mental change after gazing at
   it.

   Reallsing that the changed Individuals represented invading minds, the
   race's leaders had them destroyed -- even at the cost of leaving the
   displaced minds exiled in alien space. They had had experience with even
   stranger transitions. When, through a mental exploration of space and
   time, they formed a rough Idea of what the cube was, they carefully hid
   the thing from light and sight, and guarded it as a menace. They did not
   wish to destroy a thing so rich in later experimental possibilities. Now
   and then some rash, unscrupulous adventurer would furtively gain access to
   it and sample its perilous powers despite the consequences -- but all such
   cases were discovered, and safely and drastically dealt with.

   Of this evil meddling the only bad result was that the worm-like outside
   race learned from the new exiles what had happened to their explorers on
   earth, and conceived a violent hatred of the planet and all its
   life-forms. They would have depopulated it if they could, and indeed sent
   additional cubes into space in the wild hope of striking it by accident in
   unguarded places -- but that accident never came to pass.

   The cone-shaped terrestrial beings kept the one existing cube in a special
   shrine as a relique and basis for experiments, till after aeons it was
   lost amidst the chaos of war and the destruction of the great polar city
   where it was guarded. When, fifty million years ago, the beings sent their
   minds ahead into the infinite future to avoid a nameless peril of inner
   earth, the whereabouts of the sinister cube from space were unknown.

   This much, according to the learned occultist, the Eltdown Shards had
   said. What now made the account so obscurely frightful to Campbell was the
   minute accuracy with which the alien cube had been described. Every detail
   tallied -- dimensions, consistency, heiroglyphed central disc, hypnotic
   effects. As he thought the matter over and over amidst the darkness of his
   strange situation, he began to wonder whether his whole experience with
   the crystal cube -- indeed, its very existence -- were not a nightmare
   brought on by some freakish subconscious memory of this old bit of
   extravagant, charlatanic reading. If so, though, the nightmare must still
   be in force; since his present apparently bodiless state had nothing of
   normality in it.

   Of the time consumed by this puzzled memory and reflection, Campbell could
   form no estimate. Everything about his state was so unreal that ordinary
   dimensions and measurements became meaningless. It seemed an eternity, but
   perhaps it was not really long before the sudden interruption came. What
   happened was as strange and inexplicable as the blackness it succeeded.
   There was a sensation - of the mind rather than of the body -- and all at
   once Campbell felt his thoughts swept or sucked beyond his control in
   tumultuous and chaotic fashion.

   Memories arose irresponsibly and irrelevantly. All that he knew -- all his
   personal background, traditions, experiences, scholarship, dreams, ideas,
   and inspirations-welled up abruptly and simultaneously, with a dizzying
   speed and abundance which soon made him unable to keep track of any
   separate concept. The parade of all his mental contents became an
   avalanche, a cascade, a vortex. It was as horrible and vertiginous as his
   hypnotic flight through space when the crystal cube pulled him. Finally it
   sapped his consciousness and brought on fresh oblivion.

   Another measureless blank -- and then a slow trickle of sensation. This
   time it was physical, not mental. Sapphire light, and a low rumble of
   distant sound. There were tactile impressions -- he could realise that he
   was lying at full length on something, though there was a baffling
   strangeness about the feel of his posture. He could not reconcile the
   pressure of the supporting surface with his own outlines -- or with the
   outlines of the human form at all. He tried to move his arms, but found no
   definite response to the attempt. Instead, there were little, ineffectual
   nervous twitches all over the area which seemed to mark his body.

   He tried to open his eyes more widely, but found himself unable to control
   their mechanism. The sapphire light came in a diffused, nebulous manner,
   and could nowhere be voluntarily focussed Into definiteness. Gradually,
   though, visual images began to trickle in curiously and indecisively. The
   limits and qualities of vision were not those which he was used to, but he
   could roughly correlate the sensation with what he had known as sight. As
   this sensation gained some degree of stability, Campbell realised that he
   must still be in the throes of nightmare.

   He seemed to be in a room of considerable extent -- of medium height, but
   with a large proportionate area. On every side -- and he could apparently
   see all four sides at once -- were high, narrowish slits which seemed to
   serve as combined doors and windows. There were singular low tables or
   pedestals, but no furniture of normal nature and proportions. Through the
   slits streamed floods of sapphire light, and beyond them could be mistily
   seen the sides and roofs of fantastic buildings like clustered cubes. On
   the walls - in the vertical panels between the slits - were strange
   markings of an oddly disquieting character. It was some time before
   Campbell understood why they disturbed him so -- then he saw that they
   were, in repeated instances, precisely like some of the hieroglyphs on the
   crystal cube's disc.

   The actual nightmare element, though, was something more than this. It
   began with the living thing which presently entered through one of the
   slits, advancing deliberately toward him and bearing a metal box of
   bizarre proportions and glassy, mirror-like surfaces. For this thing was
   nothing human -- nothing of earth -- nothing even of man's myths and
   dreams. It was a gigantic, pale-grey worm or centipede, as large around as
   a man and twice as long, with a disc-like, apparently eyeless,
   cilia-fringed head bearing a purple central orifice. It glided on its rear
   pairs of legs, with its fore part raised vertically -- the legs, or at
   least two pairs of them, serving as arms. Along its spinal ridge was a
   curious purple comb, and a fan-shaped tail of some grey membrane ended its
   grotesque bulk. There was a ring of flexible red spikes around its neck,
   and from the twistings of these came clicking, twanging sounds in
   measured, deliberate rhythms.

   Here, indeed, was outre nightmare at its height -- capricious fantasy at
   its apex. But even this vision of delirium was not what caused George
   Campbell to lapse a third time into unconsciousness. It took one more
   thing -- one final, unbearable touch -- to do that. As the nameless worm
   advanced with its glistening box, the reclining man caught in the
   mirror-like surface a glimpse of what should have been his own body. Yet
   -- horribly verifying his disordered and unfamiliar sensations -- it was
   not his own body at all that he saw reflected in the burnished metal. It
   was, instead, the loathsome, pale-grey bulk of one of the great
   centipedes.

   [Robert E. Howard, and Frank Belknap Long.]

   From that final lap of senselessness, he emerged with a full understanding
   of his situation. His mind was Imprisoned in the body of a frightful
   native of an alien planet, while, somewhere on the other side of the
   universe, his own body was housing the monster's personality.

   He fought down an unreasoning horror. Judged from a cosmic standpoint, why
   should his metamorphosis horrify him? Life and consciousness were the only
   realities in the universe. Form was unimportant. His present body was
   hideous only according to terrestrial standards. Fear and revulsion were
   drowned in the excitement of titanic adventure.

   What was his former body but a cloak, eventually to be cast off at death
   anyway? He had no sentimental illusions about the life from which he had
   been exiled. What had it ever given him save toil, poverty, continual
   frustration and repression? If this life before him offered no more, at
   least it offered no less. Intuition told him it offered more -- much more.

   With the honesty possible only when life is stripped to its naked
   fundamentals, he realized that he remembered with pleasure only the
   physical delights of his former life. But he had long ago exhausted all
   the physical possibilities contained in that earthly body. Earth held no
   new thrills. But in the possession of this new, alien body he felt
   promises of strange, exotic joys.

   A lawless exultation rose in him. He was a man without a world, tree of
   all conventions or inhibitions of Earth, or of this strange planet, free
   of every artificial restraint in the universe. He was a god! With grim
   amusement he thought of his body moving in earth's business and society,
   with all the while an alien monster staring out of the windows that were
   George Campbell's eyes on people who would flee !f they knew.

   Let him walk the earth slaying and destroying as he would. Earth and its
   races no longer had any meaning to George Campbell. There he had been one
   of a billion nonentities, fixed in place by a mountainous accumulation of
   conventions, laws and manners, doomed to live and die in his sordid niche.
   But in one blind bound he had soared above the commonplace. This was not
   death, but re-birth -- the birth of a full-grown mentality, with a
   new-found freedom that made little of physical captivity on Yekub.

   He started. Yekub! It was the name of this planet, but how had he known?
   Then he knew, as he knew the name of him whose body he occupied- Tothe.
   Memory, deep grooved in Tothe's brain, was stirring in him - shadows of
   the knowledge Tothe had. Carved deep in the physical tissues of the brain,
   they spoke dimly as implanted instincts to George Campbell; and his human
   consciousness seized them and translated them to show him the way not only
   to safety and freedom, but to the power his soul, stripped to its
   primitive impulses, craved. Not as a slave would he dwell on Yekub, but as
   a kingl Just as of old barbarians had sat on the throne of lordly empires.

   For the first time he turned his attention to his surroundings. He still
   lay on the couch-like thing in the midst of that fantastic room, and the
   centipede man stood before him, holding the polished metal object, and
   clashing its neck-spikes. Thus it spoke to him, Campbell knew, and what it
   said he dimly understood, through the implanted thought processes of
   Tothe, just as he knew the creature was Yukth, supreme lord of science.

   But Campbell gave no heed, for he had made his desperate plan, a plan so
   alien to the ways of Yekub that !t was beyond Yukth's comprehension and
   caught him wholly unprepared. Yukth, like Campbell, saw the sharp-pointed
   metal shard on a nearby table, but to Yukth !t was only a scientific
   implement. He did not even know it could be used as a weapon. Campbell's
   earthly mind supplied the knowledge and the action that followed, driving
   Tothe's body into movements no man of Yekub had ever made before.

   Campbell snatched the pointed shard and struck, ripping savagely upward.
   Yukth reared and toppled, his entrails spilling on the floor. In an
   instant Campbell was streaking for a door. His speed was amazing,
   exhilarating, first fulfillment of the promise of novel physical
   sensations.

   As he ran, guided wholly by the Instinctive knowledge implanted in Tothe's
   physical reflexes, it was as If he were borne by a separate consciousness
   in his legs. Tothe's body was bearing him along a route it had traversed
   ten thousand times when animated by Tothe's mind.

   Down a winding corridor he raced, up a twisted stair, through a carved
   door, and the same instincts that had brought him there told him he had
   found what he sought. He was in a circular room with a domed roof from
   which shone a livid blue light. A strange structure rose In the middle of
   the rainbow-hued floor, tier on tier, each of a separate, vivid color. The
   ultimate tier was a purple cone, from the apex of which a blue smoky mist
   drifted upward to a sphere that poised in mid-air -- a sphere that shone
   like translucent ivory.

   This, the deep-grooved memories of Tothe told Campbell, was the god of
   Yekub, though why the people of Yekub feared and worshipped it had been
   forgotten a million years. A worm-priest stood between him and the altar
   which no hand of flesh had ever touched. That it could be touched was a
   blasphemy that had never occurred to a man of Yekub. The worm-priest stood
   in frozen horror until Campbell's shard ripped the life out of him.

   On his centipede-legs Campbell clambered the tiered altar, heedless of its
   sudden quiverings, heedless of the change that was taking place in the
   floating sphere, heedless of the smoke that now billowed out In blue
   clouds. He was drunk with the feel of power. He feared the superstitions
   of Yekub no more than he feared those of earth. With that globe in his
   hands he would be king of Yekub. The worm men would dare deny him nothing,
   when he held their god as hostage. He reached a hand for the ball -- no
   longer ivory-hued, but red as blood....

   [Frank Belknap Long]

   Out of the tent into the pale August night walked the body of George
   Campbell. It moved with a slow, wavering gait between the bodies of
   enormous trees, over a forest path strewed with sweet scented pine
   needles. The air was crisp and cold. The sky was an inverted bowl of
   frosted silver flecked with stardust, and far to the north the Aurora
   Borealis splashed streamers of fire.

   The head of the walking man lolled hideously from side to side. From the
   corners of his lax mouth drooled thick threads of amber froth, which
   fluttered in the night breeze. He walked upright at first, as a man would
   walk, but gradually as the tent receded, his posture altered. His torso
   began almost imperceptibly to slant, and his limbs to shorten.

   In a far-off world of outer space the centipede creature that was George
   Campbell clasped to Its bosom a god whose lineaments were red as blood,
   and ran with insect-like quiverings across a rainbow-hued hall and out
   through massive portals into the bright glow of alien suns.

   Weaving between the trees of earth in an attitude that suggested the
   awkward loping of a werebeast, the body of George Campbell was fulfilling
   a mindless destiny. Long, claw-tipped fingers dragged leaves from a carpet
   of odorous pine needles as it moved toward a wide expanse of gleaming
   water.

   In the far-off, extra-galactic world of the worm people, George Campbell
   moved between cyclopean blocks of black masonry down long, fern-planted
   avenues holding aloft the round red god.

   There was a harsh animal cry in the underbrush near the gleaming lake on
   earth where the mind of a worm creature dwelt in a body swayed by
   instinct. Human teeth sank into soft animal fur, tore at black animal
   flesh. A little silver fox sank its fangs in frantic retaliation into a
   furry human wrist, and thrashed about in terror as its blood spurted.
   Slowly the body of George Campbell arose, its mouth splashed with fresh
   blood. With upper limbs swaying oddly it moved towards the waters of the
   lake.

   As the variform creature that was George Campbell crawled between the
   black blocks of stone thousands of worm-shapes prostrated themselves in
   the scintillating dust before it. A godlike power seemed to emanate from
   its weaving body as it moved with a slow, undulant motion toward a throne
   of spiritual empire transcending all the sovereignties of earth.

   A trapper stumbling wearily through the dense woods of earth near the tent
   where the worm-creature dwelt in the body of George Campbell came to the
   gleaming waters of the lake and discerned something dark floating there.
   He had been lost in the woods all night, and weariness enveloped him like
   a leaden cloak in the pale morning light.

   But the shape was a challenge that he could not ignore. Moving to the edge
   of the water he knelt in the soft mud and reached out toward the floating
   bulk. Slowly he pulled it to the shore.

   Far off in outer space the worm-creature holding the glowing red god
   ascended a throne that gleamed like the constellation Cassiopeia under an
   alien vault of hyper-suns. The great deity that he held aloft energized
   his worm tenement, burning away in the white fire of a supermundane
   spirituality all animal dross.

   On earth the trapper gazed with unutterable horror into the blackened and
   hairy face of the drowned man. It was a bestial face, repulsively
   anthropoid in contour, and from its twisted, distorted mouth black ichor
   poured.

   "He who sought your body in the abysses of Time will occupy an
   unresponsive tenement," said the red god. "No spawn of Yekub can control
   the body of a human.

   "On all earth, living creatures rend one another, and feast with
   unutterable cruelty on their kith and kin. No worm-mind can control a
   bestial man-body when it yearns to raven. Only man-minds Instinctively
   conditioned through the course of ten thousand generations can keep the
   human instincts in thrall. Your body will destroy Itself on earth, seeking
   the blood of its animal kin, seeking the cool water where it can wallow at
   Its ease. Seeking eventually destruction, for the death-instinct is more
   powerful in it than the instincts of life and it will destroy itself in
   seeking to return to the slime from which it sprang."

   Thus spoke the round red god of Yekub in a far-off segment of the
   space-time continuum to George Campbell as the latter, with all human
   desire purged away, sat on a throne and ruled an empire of worms more
   wisely kindly, and benevolently than any man of earth had ever ruled an
   empire of men.
