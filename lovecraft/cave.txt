   The horrible conclusion which had been gradually obtruding itself upon my
   confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty. I was lost,
   completely, hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recess of the
   Mammoth Cave. Turn as I might, in no direction could my straining vision
   seize on any object capable of serving as a guidepost to set me on the
   outward path. That nevermore should I behold the blessed light of day, or
   scan the pleasant bills and dales of the beautiful world outside, my
   reason could no longer entertain the slightest unbelief. Hope had
   departed. Yet, indoctrinated as I was by a life of philosophical study, I
   derived no small measure of satisfaction from my unimpassioned demeanour;
   for although I had frequently read of the wild frenzies into which were
   thrown the victims of similar situations, I experienced none of these, but
   stood quiet as soon as I clearly realised the loss of my bearings.

   Nor did the thought that I had probably wandered beyond the utmost limits
   of an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure even for a moment.
   If I must die, I reflected, then was this terrible yet majestic cavern as
   welcome a sepulchre as that which any churchyard might afford, a
   conception which carried with it more of tranquillity than of despair.

   Starving would prove my ultimate fate; of this I was certain. Some, I
   knew, had gone mad under circumstances such as these, but I felt that this
   end would not be mine. My disaster was the result of no fault save my own,
   since unknown to the guide I had separated myself from the regular party
   of sightseers; and, wandering for over an hour in forbidden avenues of the
   cave, had found myself unable to retrace the devious windings which I had
   pursued since forsaking my companions.

   Already my torch had begun to expire; soon I would be enveloped by the
   total and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth. As I stood
   in the waning, unsteady light, I idly wondered over the exact
   circumstances of my coming end. I remembered the accounts which I had
   heard of the colony of consumptives, who, taking their residence in this
   gigantic grotto to find health from the apparently salubrious air of the
   underground world, with its steady, uniform temperature, pure air, and
   peaceful quiet, had found, instead, death in strange and ghastly form. I
   had seen the sad remains of their ill-made cottages as I passed them by
   with the party, and had wondered what unnatural influence a long sojourn
   in this immense and silent cavern would exert upon one as healthy and
   vigorous as I. Now, I grimly told myself, my opportunity for settling this
   point had arrived, provided that want of food should not bring me too
   speedy a departure from this life.

   As the last fitful rays of my torch faded into obscurity, I resolved to
   leave no stone unturned, no possible means of escape neglected; so,
   summoning all the powers possessed by my lungs, I set up a series of loud
   shoutings, in the vain hope of attracting the attention of the guide by my
   clamour. Yet, as I called, I believed in my heart that my cries were to no
   purpose, and that my voice, magnified and reflected by the numberless
   ramparts of the black maze about me, fell upon no ears save my own.

   All at once, however, my attention was fixed with a start as I fancied
   that I heard the sound of soft approaching steps on the rocky floor of the
   cavern.

   Was my deliverance about to be accomplished so soon? Had, then, all my
   horrible apprehensions been for naught, and was the guide, having marked
   my unwarranted absence from the party, following my course and seeking me
   out in this limestone labyrinth? Whilst these joyful queries arose in my
   brain, I was on the point of renewing my cries, in order that my discovery
   might come the sooner, when in an instant my delight was turned to horror
   as I listened; for my ever acute ear, now sharpened in even greater degree
   by the complete silence of the cave, bore to my benumbed understanding the
   unexpected and dreadful knowledge that these footfalls were not like those
   of any mortal man. In the unearthly stillness of this subterranean region,
   the tread of the booted guide would have sounded like a series of sharp
   and incisive blows. These impacts were soft, and stealthy, as of the paws
   of some feline. Besides, when I listened carefully, I seemed to trace the
   falls of four instead of two feet.

   I was now convinced that I had by my own cries aroused and attracted some
   wild beast, perhaps a mountain lion which had accidentally strayed within
   the cave. Perhaps, I considered, the Almighty had chosen for me a swifter
   and more merciful death than that of hunger; yet the instinct of
   self-preservation, never wholly dormant, was stirred in my breast, and
   though escape from the on-coming peril might but spare me for a sterner
   and more lingering end, I determined nevertheless to part with my life at
   as high a price as I could command. Strange as it may seem, my mind
   conceived of no intent on the part of the visitor save that of hostility.
   Accordingly, I became very quiet, in the hope that the unknown beast
   would, in the absence of a guiding sound, lose its direction as had I, and
   thus pass me by. But this hope was not destined for realisation, for the
   strange footfalls steadily advanced, the animal evidently having obtained
   my scent, which in an atmosphere so absolutely free from all distracting
   influences as is that of the cave, could doubtless be followed at great
   distance.

   Seeing therefore that I must be armed for defense against an uncanny and
   unseen attack in the dark, I groped about me the largest of the fragments
   of rock which were strewn upon all parts of the floor of the cavern in the
   vicinity, and grasping one in each hand for immediate use, awaited with
   resignation the inevitable result. Meanwhile the hideous pattering of the
   paws drew near. Certainly, the conduct of the creature was exceedingly
   strange. Most of the time, the tread seemed to be that of a quadruped,
   walking with a singular lack of unison betwixt hind and fore feet, yet at
   brief and infrequent intervals I fancied that but two feet were engaged in
   the process of locomotion. I wondered what species of animal was to
   confront me; it must, I thought, be some unfortunate beast who had paid
   for its curiosity to investigate one of the entrances of the fearful
   grotto with a life-long confinement in its interminable recesses. It
   doubtless obtained as food the eyeless fish, bats and rats of the cave, as
   well as some of the ordinary fish that are wafted in at every freshet of
   Green River, which communicates in some occult manner with the waters of
   the cave. I occupied my terrible vigil with grotesque conjectures of what
   alteration cave life might have wrought in the physical structure of the
   beast, remembering the awful appearances ascribed by local tradition to
   the consumptives who had died after long residence in the cave. Then I
   remembered with a start that, even should I succeed in felling my
   antagonist, I should never behold its form, as my torch had long since
   been extinct, and I was entirely unprovided with matches. The tension on
   my brain now became frightful. My disordered fancy conjured up hideous and
   fearsome shapes from the sinister darkness that surrounded me, and that
   actually seemed to press upon my body. Nearer, nearer, the dreadful
   footfalls approached. It seemed that I must give vent to a piercing
   scream, yet had I been sufficiently irresolute to attempt such a thing, my
   voice could scarce have responded. I was petrified, rooted to the spot. I
   doubted if my right arm would allow me to hurl its missile at the oncoming
   thing when the crucial moment should arrive. Now the steady pat, pat, of
   the steps was close at hand; now very close. I could hear the laboured
   breathing of the animal, and terror-struck as I was, I realised that it
   must have come from a considerable distance, and was correspondingly
   fatigued. Suddenly the spell broke. My right hand, guided by my ever
   trustworthy sense of hearing, threw with full force the sharp-angled bit
   of limestone which it contained, toward that point in the darkness from
   which emanated the breathing and pattering, and, wonderful to relate, it
   nearly reached its goal, for I heard the thing jump, landing at a distance
   away, where it seemed to pause.

   Having readjusted my aim, I discharged my second missile, this time most
   effectively, for with a flood of joy I listened as the creature fell in
   what sounded like a complete collapse and evidently remained prone and
   unmoving. Almost overpowered by the great relief which rushed over me, I
   reeled back against the wall. The breathing continued, in heavy, gasping
   inhalations and expirations, whence I realised that I had no more than
   wounded the creature. And now all desire to examine the thing ceased. At
   last something allied to groundless, superstitious fear had entered my
   brain, and I did not approach the body, nor did I continue to cast stones
   at it in order to complete the extinction of its life. Instead, I ran at
   full speed in what was, as nearly as I could estimate in my frenzied
   condition, the direction from which I had come. Suddenly I heard a sound
   or rather, a regular succession of sounds. In another Instant they had
   resolved themselves into a series of sharp, metallic clicks. This time
   there was no doubt. It was the guide. And then I shouted, yelled,
   screamed, even shrieked with joy as I beheld in the vaulted arches above
   the faint and glimmering effulgence which I knew to be the reflected light
   of an approaching torch. I ran to meet the flare, and before I could
   completely understand what had occurred, was lying upon the ground at the
   feet of the guide, embracing his boots and gibbering. despite my boasted
   reserve, in a most meaningless and idiotic manner, pouring out my terrible
   story, and at the same time overwhelming my auditor with protestations of
   gratitude. At length, I awoke to something like my normal consciousness.
   The guide had noted my absence upon the arrival of the party at the
   entrance of the cave, and had, from his own intuitive sense of direction,
   proceeded to make a thorough canvass of by-passages just ahead of where he
   had last spoken to me, locating my whereabouts after a quest of about four
   hours.

   By the time he had related this to me, I, emboldened by his torch and his
   company, began to reflect upon the strange beast which I had wounded but a
   short distance back in the darkness, and suggested that we ascertain, by
   the flashlight's aid, what manner of creature was my victim. Accordingly I
   retraced my steps, this time with a courage born of companionship, to the
   scene of my terrible experience. Soon we descried a white object upon the
   floor, an object whiter even than the gleaming limestone itself.
   Cautiously advancing, we gave vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of
   wonderment, for of all the unnatural monsters either of us had in our
   lifetimes beheld, this was in surpassing degree the strangest. It appeared
   to be an anthropoid ape of large proportions, escaped, perhaps, from some
   itinerant menagerie. Its hair was snow-white, a thing due no doubt to the
   bleaching action of a long existence within the inky confines of the cave,
   but it was also surprisingly thin, being indeed largely absent save on the
   head, where it was of such length and abundance that it fell over the
   shoulders in considerable profusion. The face was turned away from us, as
   the creature lay almost directly upon it. The inclination of the limbs was
   very singular, explaining, however, the alternation in their use which I
   bad before noted, whereby the beast used sometimes all four, and on other
   occasions but two for its progress. From the tips of the fingers or toes,
   long rat-like claws extended. The hands or feet were not prehensile, a
   fact that I ascribed to that long residence in the cave which, as I before
   mentioned, seemed evident from the all-pervading and almost unearthly
   whiteness so characteristic of the whole anatomy. No tail seemed to be
   present.

   The respiration had now grown very feeble, and the guide had drawn his
   pistol with the evident intent of despatching the creature, when a sudden
   sound emitted by the latter caused the weapon to fall unused. The sound
   was of a nature difficult to describe. It was not like the normal note of
   any known species of simian, and I wonder if this unnatural quality were
   not the result of a long continued and complete silence, broken by the
   sensations produced by the advent of the light, a thing which the beast
   could not have seen since its first entrance into the cave. The sound,
   which I might feebly attempt to classify as a kind of deep-tone
   chattering, was faintly continued.

   All at once a fleeting spasm of energy seemed to pass through the frame of
   the beast. The paws went through a convulsive motion, and the limbs
   contracted. With a jerk, the white body rolled over so that its face was
   turned in our direction. For a moment I was so struck with horror at the
   eyes thus revealed that I noted nothing else. They were black, those eyes,
   deep jetty black, in hideous contrast to the snow-white hair and flesh.
   Like those of other cave denizens, they were deeply sunken in their
   orbits, and were entirely destitute of iris. As I looked more closely, I
   saw that they were set in a face less prognathous than that of the average
   ape, and infinitely less hairy. The nose was quite distinct. As we gazed
   upon the uncanny sight presented to our vision, the thick lips opened, and
   several sounds issued from them, after which the thing relaxed in death.

   The guide clutched my coat sleeve and trembled so violently that the light
   shook fitfully, casting weird moving shadows on the walls.

   I made no motion, but stood rigidly still, my horrified eyes fixed upon
   the floor ahead.

   The fear left, and wonder, awe, compassion, and reverence succeeded in its
   place, for the sounds uttered by the stricken figure that lay stretched
   out on the limestone had told us the awesome truth. The creature I had
   killed, the strange beast of the unfathomed cave, was, or had at one time
   been a MAN!!!
