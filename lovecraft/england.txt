The Rose of England

  by H.P. Lovecraft

                  At morn the rosebud greets the sun           
                  And sheds the evening dew,                   
                  Expanding ere the day is done,               
                     In bloom of radiant hue                   
                  And when the sun his rest hath found,        
                  Rose-Petals strew the garden round!          
                                                               
                  Thus that blest Isle that owns the Rose      
                  From mist and darkness came,                 
                  A million glories to disclose,               
                     And spread BRITANNIA'S name;              
                  And ere Life's Sun shall leave the blue,     
                  ENGLAND shall reign the whole world through!
