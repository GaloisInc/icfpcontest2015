				<p>England! My England! can the surging sea
				<br>That lies between us tear my heart from thee?
				<br>Can distant birth and distant dwelling drain
				<br>Th' ancestral blood that warms the loyal vein?
				<br>Isle of my Fathers! hear the filial song
				<br>Of him whose sources but to thee belong!
				<br>World-Conquering Mother! by thy mighty hand
				<br>Was carv'd from savage wilds my native land:
				<br>Thy matchless sons the firm foundation laid;
				<br>Thy matchless arts the nascent nation made:
				<br>By thy just laws the young republic grew,
				<br>And through thy greatness, kindred greatness knew.
				<br>What man that springs from thy untainted line
				<br>But sees Columbia's virtues all as thine?
				<br>Whilst nameless multitudes upon our shore
				<br>From the dim corners of creation pour,
				<br>Whilst mongrel slaves crawl hither to partake
				<br>Of Saxon liberty they could not make,
				<br>From such an alien crew in grief I turn,
				<br>And for the mother's voice of Britain burn.
				<br>England! can aught remove the cherish'd chain
				<br>That binds my spirit to thy blest domain?
				<br>Can Revolution's bitter precepts sway
				<br>The soul that must the ties of race obey?
				<br>Create a new Columbia if ye will,
				<br>The flesh that forms me is Britannic still!
				<br>Hail! oaken shades, and meads of dewy green,
				<br>So oft in sleep, yet ne'er in waking seen.
				<br>Peal out, ye ancient chimes, from vine-clad tower
				<br>Where pray'd my fathers in a vanish'd hour:
				<br>What countless years of rev'rence can ye claim
				<br>From bygone worshippers that bore my name!
				<br>Their forms are crumbling in the vaults around,
				<br>Whilst I, across the sea, but dreamthe sound.
				<br>Return, Sweet Vision! Let me glimpse again
				<br>The stone-built abbey, rising o'er the plain;
				<br>The neighb'ring village with its sun-shower'd square;
				<br>The shaded mill-stream, and the forest fair,
				<br>The hedge-lin'd lane, that leads to rustic cot
				<br>Where sweet contentment is the peasant's lot:
				<br>The mystic grove, by Druid wraiths possess'd,
				<br>The flow'ring fields, with fairy-castles blest:
				<br>And the old manor-house, sedate and dark,
				<br>Set in the shadows of the wooded park.
				<br>Can this be dreaming? Must my eyelids close
				<br>That I may catch the fragrance of the rose?
				<br>Is it in fancy that the midnight vale
				<br>Thrills with the warblings of the nightingale?
				<br>A golden moon bewitching radiance yields,
				<br>And England's fairies trip o'er England's fields.
				<br>England! Old England! in my love for thee
				<br>No dream is mine, but blessed memory;
				<br>Such haunting images and hidden fires
				<br>Course with the bounding blood of British sires:
				<br>From British bodies, minds, and souls I come,
				<br>And from them draw the vision of their home.
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake, Columbia! scorn the vulgar age
				<br>That bids thee slight thy lordly heritage.
				<br>Let not the wide Atlantic's wildest wave
				<br>Burst the blest bonds that fav'ring Nature gave:
				<br>Connecting surges 'twixt the nations run,
				<br>Our Saxon souls dissolving into one!
