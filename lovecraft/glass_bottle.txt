                                  Written 1897

   "Heave to, there's something floating to the leeward"  the speaker was a
   short stockily built man whose name was William Jones. he was the captain
   of a small cat boat in which he & a party of men were sailing at the time
   the story opens.

   "Aye aye sir" answered John Towers & the boat was brought to a stand
   still  Captain Jones reached out his hand for the object which he now
   discerned to be a glass bottle  "Nothing but a rum flask that the men on a
   passing boat threw over" he said but from an impulse of curiosity he
   reached out for it. it was a rum flask & he was about to throw it away
   when he noticed a piece of paper in it. He pulled it out & on it read the
   following

     Jan 1 1864

     I am John Jones who writes this letter  my ship is fast sinking with a
     treasure on board  I am where it is marked * on the enclosed chart

                                      Map

   Captain Jones turned the sheet over & the other side was a chart on the
   edge were written these words

     dotted lines represent course we took

   "Towers" Said Capt. Jones exitedly "read this"  Towers did as he was
   directed  "I think it would pay to go" said Capt. Jones  "do you"?  "Just
   as you say" replied Towers. "We'll charter a schooner this very day" said
   the exited captain  "All right" said Towers  so they hired a boat and
   started off govnd by the dotted lines of they chart  in 4 weeks the
   reached the place where directed & the divers went down and came up with
   an iron bottle  they found in it the following lines scribbled on a piece
   of brown paper

     Dec 3 1880

     Dear Searcher  excuse me for the practical joke I have played on you but
     it serves you right to find nothing for your foolish act-

   "Well it does" said Capt Jones  "go on"

     However I will defray your expenses to & from the place you found your
     bottle  I think it will be $25.0.00 so that amount you will find in an
     Iron box  I know where you found the bottle because I put this bottle
     here & the iron box & then found a good place to put the second
     bottle  hoping the enclosed money will defray your expenses some I
     close&#8212Anonymus"

   "I'd like to kick his head off" said Capt Jones  "Here diver go & get the
   $25.0.00  in a minute the diver came up bearing an iron box  in side it
   was found $25.0.00  It defrayed their expenses but I hardly think that
   they will ever go to a mysterious place as directed by a mysterious
   bottle.
