The House

  by H. P. Lovecraft

  'Tis a grove-circled dwelling                                                 
    Set close to a hill,                                                        
  Where the branches are telling                                                
    Strange legends of ill;                                                     
  Over timbers so old                                                           
    That they breathe of the dead,                                              
  Crawl the vines, green and cold,                                              
    By strange nourishment fed;                                                 
And no man knows the juices they suck from the depths of their dank slimy bed.  
                                                                                
  In the gardens are growing                                                    
    Tall blossoms and fair,                                                     
  Each pallid bloom throwing                                                    
    Perfume on the air;                                                         
  But the afternoon sun                                                         
    with its shining red rays                                                   
  Makes the picture loom dun                                                    
    On the curious gaze,                                                        
And above the sween scent of the the blossoms rise odours of numberless days.   
                                                                                
  The rank grasses are waving                                                   
    On terrace and lawn,                                                        
  Dim memories savouring                                                        
    Of things that have gone;                                                   
  The stones of the walks                                                       
    Are encrusted and wet,                                                      
  And a strange spirit stalks                                                   
    When the red sun has set.                                                   
And the soul of the watcher is fill'd with faint pictures he fain would forget. 
                                                                                
  It was in the hot Junetime                                                    
    I stood by that scene,                                                      
  When the gold rays of noontime                                                
    Beat bright on the green.                                                   
  But I shiver'd with cold,                                                     
    Groping feebly for light,                                                   
  As a picture unroll'd -                                                       
    And my age-spanning sight                                                   
Saw the time I had been there before flash like fulgury out of the night.
