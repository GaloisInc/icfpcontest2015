				<h3>I. The Book</h3>

				<p>The place was dark and dusty and half-lost
				<br>In tangles of old alleys near the quays,
				<br>Reeking of strange things brought in from the seas,
				<br>And with queer curls of fog that west winds tossed.
				<br>Small lozenge panes, obscured by smoke and frost,
				<br>Just shewed the books, in piles like twisted trees,
				<br>Rotting from floor to roof - congeries
				<br>Of crumbling elder lore at little cost.

				<p>I entered, charmed, and from a cobwebbed heap
				<br>Took up the nearest tome and thumbed it through,
				<br>Trembling at curious words that seemed to keep
				<br>Some secret, monstrous if one only knew.
				<br>Then, looking for some seller old in craft,
				<br>I could find nothing but a voice that laughed.

				<h3>II. Pursuit</h3>

				<p>I held the book beneath my coat, at pains
				<br>To hide the thing from sight in such a place;
				<br>Hurrying through the ancient harbor lanes
				<br>With often-turning head and nervous pace.
				<br>Dull, furtive windows in old tottering brick
				<br>Peered at me oddly as I hastened by,
				<br>And thinking what they sheltered, I grew sick
				<br>For a redeeming glimpse of clean blue sky.

				<p>No one had seen me take the thing - but still
				<br>A blank laugh echoed in my whirling head,
				<br>And I could guess what nighted worlds of ill
				<br>Lurked in that volume I had coveted.
				<br>The way grew strange - the walls alike and madding -
				<br>And far behind me, unseen feet were padding.

				<h3>III. The Key</h3>

				<p>I do not know what windings in the waste
				<br>Of those strange sea-lanes brought me home once more,
				<br>But on my porch I trembled, white with haste
				<br>To get inside and bolt the heavy door.
				<br>I had the book that told the hidden way
				<br>Across the void and through the space-hung screens
				<br>That hold the undimensioned worlds at bay,
				<br>And keep lost aeons to their own demesnes.

				<p>At last the key was mine to those vague visions
				<br>Of sunset spires and twilight woods that brood
				<br>Dim in the gulfs beyond this earth's precisions,
				<br>Lurking as memories of infinitude.
				<br>The key was mine, but as I sat there mumbling,
				<br>The attic window shook with a faint fumbling.

				<h3>IV. Recognition</h3>

				<p>The day had come again, when as a child
				<br>I saw - just once - that hollow of old oaks,
				<br>Grey with a ground-mist that enfolds and chokes
				<br>The slinking shapes which madness has defiled.
				<br>It was the same - an herbage rank and wild
				<br>Clings round an altar whose carved sign invokes
				<br>That Nameless One to whom a thousand smokes
				<br>Rose, aeons gone, from unclean towers up-piled.

				<p>I saw the body spread on that dank stone,
				<br>And knew those things which feasted were not men;
				<br>I knew this strange, grey world was not my own,
				<br>But Yuggoth, past the starry voids - and then
				<br>The body shrieked at me with a dead cry,
				<br>And all too late I knew that it was I!

				<h3>V. Homecoming</h3>

				<p>The daemon said that he would take me home
				<br>To the pale, shadowy land I half recalled
				<br>As a high place of stair and terrace, walled
				<br>With marble balustrades that sky-winds comb,
				<br>While miles below a maze of dome on dome
				<br>And tower on tower beside a sea lies sprawled.
				<br>Once more, he told me, I would stand enthralled
				<br>On those old heights, and hear the far-off foam.

				<p>All this he promised, and through sunset's gate
				<br>He swept me, past the lapping lakes of flame,
				<br>And red-gold thrones of gods without a name
				<br>Who shriek in fear at some impending fate.
				<br>Then a black gulf with sea-sounds in the night:
				<br>"Here was your home," he mocked, "when you had sight!"

				<h3>VI. The Lamp</h3>

				<p>We found the lamp inside those hollow cliffs
				<br>Whose chiseled sign no priest in Thebes could read,
				<br>And from whose caverns frightened hieroglyphs
				<br>Warned every living creature of earth's breed.
				<br>No more was there - just that one brazen bowl
				<br>With traces of a curious oil within;
				<br>Fretted with some obscurely patterned scroll,
				<br>And symbols hinting vaguely of strange sin.

				<p>Little the fears of forty centuries meant
				<br>To us as we bore off our slender spoil,
				<br>And when we scanned it in our darkened tent
				<br>We struck a match to test the ancient oil.
				<br>It blazed - great God!... But the vast shapes we saw
				<br>In that mad flash have seared our lives with awe.

				<h3>VII. Zaman's Hill</h3>

				<p>The great hill hung close over the old town,
				<br>A precipice against the main street's end;
				<br>Green, tall, and wooded, looking darkly down
				<br>Upon the steeple at the highway bend.
				<br>Two hundred years the whispers had been heard
				<br>About what happened on the man-shunned slope -
				<br>Tales of an oddly mangled deer or bird,
				<br>Or of lost boys whose kin had ceased to hope.

				<p>One day the mail-man found no village there,
				<br>Nor were its folk or houses seen again;
				<br>People came out from Aylesbury to stare -
				<br>Yet they all told the mail-man it was plain
				<br>That he was mad for saying he had spied
				<br>The great hill's gluttonous eyes, and jaws stretched wide.

				<h3>VIII. The Port</h3>

				<p>Ten miles from Arkham I had struck the trail
				<br>That rides the cliff-edge over Boynton Beach,
				<br>And hoped that just at sunset I could reach
				<br>The crest that looks on Innsmouth in the vale.
				<br>Far out at sea was a retreating sail,
				<br>White as hard years of ancient winds could bleach,
				<br>But evil with some portent beyond speech,
				<br>So that I did not wave my hand or hail.

				<p>Sails out of lnnsmouth! echoing old renown
				<br>Of long-dead times. But now a too-swift night
				<br>Is closing in, and I have reached the height
				<br>Whence I so often scan the distant town.
				<br>The spires and roofs are there - but look! The gloom
				<br>Sinks on dark lanes, as lightless as the tomb!

				<h3>IX. The Courtyard</h3>

				<p>It was the city I had known before;
				<br>The ancient, leprous town where mongrel throngs
				<br>Chant to strange gods, and beat unhallowed gongs
				<br>In crypts beneath foul alleys near the shore.
				<br>The rotting, fish-eyed houses leered at me
				<br>From where they leaned, drunk and half-animate,
				<br>As edging through the filth I passed the gate
				<br>To the black courtyard where the man would be.

				<p>The dark walls closed me in, and loud I cursed
				<br>That ever I had come to such a den,
				<br>When suddenly a score of windows burst
				<br>Into wild light, and swarmed with dancing men:
				<br>Mad, soundless revels of the dragging dead -
				<br>And not a corpse had either hands or head!

				<h3>X. The Pigeon-Flyers</h3>

				<p>They took me slumming, where gaunt walls of brick
				<br>Bulge outward with a viscous stored-up evil,
				<br>And twisted faces, thronging foul and thick,
				<br>Wink messages to alien god and devil.
				<br>A million fires were blazing in the streets,
				<br>And from flat roofs a furtive few would fly
				<br>Bedraggled birds into the yawning sky
				<br>While hidden drums droned on with measured beats.

				<p>I knew those fires were brewing monstrous things,
				<br>And that those birds of space had been Outside -
				<br>I guessed to what dark planet's crypts they plied,
				<br>And what they brought from Thog beneath their wings.
				<br>The others laughed - till struck too mute to speak
				<br>By what they glimpsed in one bird's evil beak.

				<h3>XI. The Well</h3>

				<p>Farmer Seth Atwood was past eighty when
				<br>He tried to sink that deep well by his door,
				<br>With only Eb to help him bore and bore.
				<br>We laughed, and hoped he'd soon be sane again.
				<br>And yet, instead, young Eb went crazy, too,
				<br>So that they shipped him to the county farm.
				<br>Seth bricked the well-mouth up as tight as glue -
				<br>Then hacked an artery in his gnarled left arm.

				<p>After the funeral we felt bound to get
				<br>Out to that well and rip the bricks away,
				<br>But all we saw were iron hand-holds set
				<br>Down a black hole deeper than we could say.
				<br>And yet we put the bricks back - for we found
				<br>The hole too deep for any line to sound.

				<h3>XII. The Howler</h3>

				<p>They told me not to take the Briggs' Hill path
				<br>That used to be the highroad through to Zoar,
				<br>For Goody Watkins, hanged in seventeen-four,
				<br>Had left a certain monstrous aftermath.
				<br>Yet when I disobeyed, and had in view
				<br>The vine-hung cottage by the great rock slope,
				<br>I could not think of elms or hempen rope,
				<br>But wondered why the house still seemed so new.

				<p>Stopping a while to watch the fading day,
				<br>I heard faint howls, as from a room upstairs,
				<br>When through the ivied panes one sunset ray
				<br>Struck in, and caught the howler unawares.
				<br>I glimpsed - and ran in frenzy from the place,
				<br>And from a four-pawed thing with human face.

				<h3>XIII. Hesperia</h3>

				<p>The winter sunset, flaming beyond spires
				<br>And chimneys half-detached from this dull sphere,
				<br>Opens great gates to some forgotten year
				<br>Of elder splendours and divine desires.
				<br>Expectant wonders burn in those rich fires,
				<br>Adventure-fraught, and not untinged with fear;
				<br>A row of sphinxes where the way leads clear
				<br>Toward walls and turrets quivering to far lyres.

				<p>It is the land where beauty's meaning flowers;
				<br>Where every unplaced memory has a source;
				<br>Where the great river Time begins its course
				<br>Down the vast void in starlit streams of hours.
				<br>Dreams bring us close - but ancient lore repeats
				<br>That human tread has never soiled these streets.

				<h3>XIV. Star-Winds</h3>

				<p>It is a certain hour of twilight glooms,
				<br>Mostly in autumn, when the star-wind pours
				<br>Down hilltop streets, deserted out-of-doors,
				<br>But shewing early lamplight from snug rooms.
				<br>The dead leaves rush in strange, fantastic twists,
				<br>And chimney-smoke whirls round with alien grace,
				<br>Heeding geometries of outer space,
				<br>While Fomalhaut peers in through southward mists.

				<p>This is the hour when moonstruck poets know
				<br>What fungi sprout in Yuggoth, and what scents
				<br>And tints of flowers fill Nithon's continents,
				<br>Such as in no poor earthly garden blow.
				<br>Yet for each dream these winds to us convey,
				<br>A dozen more of ours they sweep away!

				<h3>XV. Antarktos</h3>

				<p>Deep in my dream the great bird whispered queerly
				<br>Of the black cone amid the polar waste;
				<br>Pushing above the ice-sheet lone and drearly,
				<br>By storm-crazed aeons battered and defaced.
				<br>Hither no living earth-shapes take their courses,
				<br>And only pale auroras and faint suns
				<br>Glow on that pitted rock, whose primal sources
				<br>Are guessed at dimly by the Elder Ones.

				<p>If men should glimpse it, they would merely wonder
				<br>What tricky mound of Nature's build they spied;
				<br>But the bird told of vaster parts, that under
				<br>The mile-deep ice-shroud crouch and brood and bide.
				<br>God help the dreamer whose mad visions shew
				<br>Those dead eyes set in crystal gulfs below!

				<h3>XVI. The Window</h3>

				<p>The house was old, with tangled wings outthrown,
				<br>Of which no one could ever half keep track,
				<br>And in a small room somewhat near the back
				<br>Was an odd window sealed with ancient stone.
				<br>There, in a dream-plagued childhood, quite alone
				<br>I used to go, where night reigned vague and black;
				<br>Parting the cobwebs with a curious lack
				<br>Of fear, and with a wonder each time grown.

				<p>One later day I brought the masons there
				<br>To find what view my dim forbears had shunned,
				<br>But as they pierced the stone, a rush of air
				<br>Burst from the alien voids that yawned beyond.
				<br>They fled - but I peered through and found unrolled
				<br>All the wild worlds of which my dreams had told.

				<h3>XVII. A Memory</h3>

				<p>There were great steppes, and rocky table-lands
				<br>Stretching half-limitless in starlit night,
				<br>With alien campfires shedding feeble light
				<br>On beasts with tinkling bells, in shaggy bands.
				<br>Far to the south the plain sloped low and wide
				<br>To a dark zigzag line of wall that lay
				<br>Like a huge python of some primal day
				<br>Which endless time had chilled and petrified.

				<p>I shivered oddly in the cold, thin air,
				<br>And wondered where I was and how I came,
				<br>When a cloaked form against a campfire's glare
				<br>Rose and approached, and called me by my name.
				<br>Staring at that dead face beneath the hood,
				<br>I ceased to hope - because I understood.

				<h3>XVIII. The Gardens of Yin</h3>

				<p>Beyond that wall, whose ancient masonry
				<br>Reached almost to the sky in moss-thick towers,
				<br>There would be terraced gardens, rich with flowers,
				<br>And flutter of bird and butterfly and bee.
				<br>There would be walks, and bridges arching over
				<br>Warm lotos-pools reflecting temple eaves,
				<br>And cherry-trees with delicate boughs and leaves
				<br>Against a pink sky where the herons hover.

				<p>All would be there, for had not old dreams flung
				<br>Open the gate to that stone-lanterned maze
				<br>Where drowsy streams spin out their winding ways,
				<br>Trailed by green vines from bending branches hung?
				<br>I hurried - but when the wall rose, grim and great,
				<br>I found there was no longer any gate.

				<h3>XIX. The Bells</h3>

				<p>Year after year I heard that faint, far ringing
				<br>Of deep-toned bells on the black midnight wind;
				<br>Peals from no steeple I could ever find,
				<br>But strange, as if across some great void winging.
				<br>I searched my dreams and memories for a clue,
				<br>And thought of all the chimes my visions carried;
				<br>Of quiet Innsmouth, where the white gulls tarried
				<br>Around an ancient spire that once I knew.

				<p>Always perplexed I heard those far notes falling,
				<br>Till one March night the bleak rain splashing cold
				<br>Beckoned me back through gateways of recalling
				<br>To elder towers where the mad clappers tolled.
				<br>They tolled - but from the sunless tides that pour
				<br>Through sunken valleys on the sea's dead floor.

				<h3>XX. Night-Gaunts</h3>

				<p>Out of what crypt they crawl, I cannot tell,
				<br>But every night I see the rubbery things,
				<br>Black, horned, and slender, with membraneous wings,
				<br>And tails that bear the bifid barb of hell.
				<br>They come in legions on the north wind's swell,
				<br>With obscene clutch that titillates and stings,
				<br>Snatching me off on monstrous voyagings
				<br>To grey worlds hidden deep in nightmare's well.

				<p>Over the jagged peaks of Thok they sweep,
				<br>Heedless of all the cries I try to make,
				<br>And down the nether pits to that foul lake
				<br>Where the puffed shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep.
				<br>But oh! If only they would make some sound,
				<br>Or wear a face where faces should be found!

				<h3>XXI. Nyarlathotep</h3>

				<p>And at the last from inner Egypt came
				<br>The strange dark One to whom the fellahs bowed;
				<br>Silent and lean and cryptically proud,
				<br>And wrapped in fabrics red as sunset flame.
				<br>Throngs pressed around, frantic for his commands,
				<br>But leaving, could not tell what they had heard;
				<br>While through the nations spread the awestruck word
				<br>That wild beasts followed him and licked his hands.

				<p>Soon from the sea a noxious birth began;
				<br>Forgotten lands with weedy spires of gold;
				<br>The ground was cleft, and mad auroras rolled
				<br>Down on the quaking citadels of man.
				<br>Then, crushing what he chanced to mould in play,
				<br>The idiot Chaos blew Earth's dust away.

				<h3>XXII. Azathoth</h3>

				<p>Out in the mindless void the daemon bore me,
				<br>Past the bright clusters of dimensioned space,
				<br>Till neither time nor matter stretched before me,
				<br>But only Chaos, without form or place.
				<br>Here the vast Lord of All in darkness muttered
				<br>Things he had dreamed but could not understand,
				<br>While near him shapeless bat-things flopped and fluttered
				<br>In idiot vortices that ray-streams fanned.

				<p>They danced insanely to the high, thin whining
				<br>Of a cracked flute clutched in a monstrous paw,
				<br>Whence flow the aimless waves whose chance combining
				<br>Gives each frail cosmos its eternal law.
				<br>"I am His Messenger," the daemon said,
				<br>As in contempt he struck his Master's head.

				<h3>XXIII. Mirage</h3>

				<p>I do not know if ever it existed -
				<br>That lost world floating dimly on Time's stream -
				<br>And yet I see it often, violet-misted,
				<br>And shimmering at the back of some vague dream.
				<br>There were strange towers and curious lapping rivers,
				<br>Labyrinths of wonder, and low vaults of light,
				<br>And bough-crossed skies of flame, like that which quivers
				<br>Wistfully just before a winter's night.

				<p>Great moors led off to sedgy shores unpeopled,
				<br>Where vast birds wheeled, while on a windswept hill
				<br>There was a village, ancient and white-steepled,
				<br>With evening chimes for which I listen still.
				<br>I do not know what land it is - or dare
				<br>Ask when or why I was, or will be, there.

				<h3>XXIV. The Canal</h3>

				<p>Somewhere in dream there is an evil place
				<br>Where tall, deserted buildings crowd along
				<br>A deep, black, narrow channel, reeking strong
				<br>Of frightful things whence oily currents race.
				<br>Lanes with old walls half meeting overhead
				<br>Wind off to streets one may or may not know,
				<br>And feeble moonlight sheds a spectral glow
				<br>Over long rows of windows, dark and dead.

				<p>There are no footfalls, and the one soft sound
				<br>Is of the oily water as it glides
				<br>Under stone bridges, and along the sides
				<br>Of its deep flume, to some vague ocean bound.
				<br>None lives to tell when that stream washed away
				<br>Its dream-lost region from the world of clay.

				<h3>XXV. St. Toad's</h3>

				<p>"Beware St. Toad's cracked chimes!" I heard him scream
				<br>As I plunged into those mad lanes that wind
				<br>In labyrinths obscure and undefined
				<br>South of the river where old centuries dream.
				<br>He was a furtive figure, bent and ragged,
				<br>And in a flash had staggered out of sight,
				<br>So still I burrowed onward in the night
				<br>Toward where more roof-lines rose, malign and jagged.

				<p>No guide-book told of what was lurking here -
				<br>But now I heard another old man shriek:
				<br>"Beware St.Toad's cracked chimes!" And growing weak,
				<br>I paused, when a third greybeard croaked in fear:
				<br>"Beware St. Toad's cracked chimes!" Aghast, I fled -
				<br>Till suddenly that black spire loomed ahead.

				<h3>XXVI. The Familiars</h3>

				<p>John Whateley lived about a mile from town,
				<br>Up where the hills begin to huddle thick;
				<br>We never thought his wits were very quick,
				<br>Seeing the way he let his farm run down.
				<br>He used to waste his time on some queer books
				<br>He'd found around the attic of his place,
				<br>Till funny lines got creased into his face,
				<br>And folks all said they didn't like his looks.

				<p>When he began those night-howls we declared
				<br>He'd better be locked up away from harm,
				<br>So three men from the Aylesbury town farm
				<br>Went for him - but came back alone and scared.
				<br>They'd found him talking to two crouching things
				<br>That at their step flew off on great black wings.

				<h3>XXVII. The Elder Pharos</h3>

				<p>From Leng, where rocky peaks climb bleak and bare
				<br>Under cold stars obscure to human sight,
				<br>There shoots at dusk a single beam of light
				<br>Whose far blue rays make shepherds whine in prayer.
				<br>They say (though none has been there) that it comes
				<br>Out of a pharos in a tower of stone,
				<br>Where the last Elder One lives on alone,
				<br>Talking to Chaos with the beat of drums.

				<p>The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken mask
				<br>Of yellow, whose queer folds appear to hide
				<br>A face not of this earth, though none dares ask
				<br>Just what those features are, which bulge inside.
				<br>Many, in man's first youth, sought out that glow,
				<br>But what they found, no one will ever know.

				<h3>XXVIII. Expectancy</h3>

				<p>I cannot tell why some things hold for me
				<br>A sense of unplumbed marvels to befall,
				<br>Or of a rift in the horizon's wall
				<br>Opening to worlds where only gods can be.
				<br>There is a breathless, vague expectancy,
				<br>As of vast ancient pomps I half recall,
				<br>Or wild adventures, uncorporeal,
				<br>Ecstasy-fraught, and as a day-dream free.

				<p>It is in sunsets and strange city spires,
				<br>Old villages and woods and misty downs,
				<br>South winds, the sea, low hills, and lighted towns,
				<br>Old gardens, half-heard songs, and the moon's fires.
				<br>But though its lure alone makes life worth living,
				<br>None gains or guesses what it hints at giving.

				<h3>XXIX. Nostalgia</h3>

				<p>Once every year, in autumn's wistful glow,
				<br>The birds fly out over an ocean waste,
				<br>Calling and chattering in a joyous haste
				<br>To reach some land their inner memories know.
				<br>Great terraced gardens where bright blossoms blow,
				<br>And lines of mangoes luscious to the taste,
				<br>And temple-groves with branches interlaced
				<br>Over cool paths - all these their vague dreams shew.

				<p>They search the sea for marks of their old shore -
				<br>For the tall city, white and turreted -
				<br>But only empty waters stretch ahead,
				<br>So that at last they turn away once more.
				<br>Yet sunken deep where alien polyps throng,
				<br>The old towers miss their lost, remembered song.

				<h3>XXX. Background</h3>

				<p>I never can be tied to raw, new things,
				<br>For I first saw the light in an old town,
				<br>Where from my window huddled roofs sloped down
				<br>To a quaint harbour rich with visionings.
				<br>Streets with carved doorways where the sunset beams
				<br>Flooded old fanlights and small window-panes,
				<br>And Georgian steeples topped with gilded vanes -
				<br>These were the sights that shaped my childhood dreams.

				<p>Such treasures, left from times of cautious leaven,
				<br>Cannot but loose the hold of flimsier wraiths
				<br>That flit with shifting ways and muddled faiths
				<br>Across the changeless walls of earth and heaven.
				<br>They cut the moment's thongs and leave me free
				<br>To stand alone before eternity.

				<h3>XXXI. The Dweller</h3>

				<p>It had been old when Babylon was new;
				<br>None knows how long it slept beneath that mound,
				<br>Where in the end our questing shovels found
				<br>Its granite blocks and brought it back to view.
				<br>There were vast pavements and foundation-walls,
				<br>And crumbling slabs and statues, carved to shew
				<br>Fantastic beings of some long ago
				<br>Past anything the world of man recalls.

				<p>And then we saw those stone steps leading down
				<br>Through a choked gate of graven dolomite
				<br>To some black haven of eternal night
				<br>Where elder signs and primal secrets frown.
				<br>We cleared a path - but raced in mad retreat
				<br>When from below we heard those clumping feet.

				<h3>XXXII. Alienation</h3>

				<p>His solid flesh had never been away,
				<br>For each dawn found him in his usual place,
				<br>But every night his spirit loved to race
				<br>Through gulfs and worlds remote from common day.
				<br>He had seen Yaddith, yet retained his mind,
				<br>And come back safely from the Ghooric zone,
				<br>When one still night across curved space was thrown
				<br>That beckoning piping from the voids behind.

				<p>He waked that morning as an older man,
				<br>And nothing since has looked the same to him.
				<br>Objects around float nebulous and dim -
				<br>False, phantom trifles of some vaster plan.
				<br>His folk and friends are now an alien throng
				<br>To which he struggles vainly to belong.

				<h3>XXXIII. Harbour Whistles</h3>

				<p>Over old roofs and past decaying spires
				<br>The harbour whistles chant all through the night;
				<br>Throats from strange ports, and beaches far and white,
				<br>And fabulous oceans, ranged in motley choirs.
				<br>Each to the other alien and unknown,
				<br>Yet all, by some obscurely focussed force
				<br>From brooding gulfs beyond the Zodiac's course,
				<br>Fused into one mysterious cosmic drone.

				<p>Through shadowy dreams they send a marching line
				<br>Of still more shadowy shapes and hints and views;
				<br>Echoes from outer voids, and subtle clues
				<br>To things which they themselves cannot define.
				<br>And always in that chorus, faintly blent,
				<br>We catch some notes no earth-ship ever sent.

				<h3>XXXIV. Recapture</h3>

				<p>The way led down a dark, half-wooded heath
				<br>Where moss-grey boulders humped above the mould,
				<br>And curious drops, disquieting and cold,
				<br>Sprayed up from unseen streams in gulfs beneath.
				<br>There was no wind, nor any trace of sound
				<br>In puzzling shrub, or alien-featured tree,
				<br>Nor any view before - till suddenly,
				<br>Straight in my path, I saw a monstrous mound.

				<p>Half to the sky those steep sides loomed upspread,
				<br>Rank-grassed, and cluttered by a crumbling flight
				<br>Of lava stairs that scaled the fear-topped height
				<br>In steps too vast for any human tread.
				<br>I shrieked - and knew what primal star and year
				<br>Had sucked me back from man's dream-transient sphere!

				<h3>XXXV. Evening Star</h3>

				<p>I saw it from that hidden, silent place
				<br>Where the old wood half shuts the meadow in.
				<br>It shone through all the sunset's glories - thin
				<br>At first, but with a slowly brightening face.
				<br>Night came, and that lone beacon, amber-hued,
				<br>Beat on my sight as never it did of old;
				<br>The evening star - but grown a thousandfold
				<br>More haunting in this hush and solitude.

				<p>It traced strange pictures on the quivering air -
				<br>Half-memories that had always filled my eyes -
				<br>Vast towers and gardens; curious seas and skies
				<br>Of some dim life - I never could tell where.
				<br>But now I knew that through the cosmic dome
				<br>Those rays were calling from my far, lost home.


				<h3>XXXVI. Continuity</h3>

				<p>There is in certain ancient things a trace
				<br>Of some dim essence - more than form or weight;
				<br>A tenuous aether, indeterminate,
				<br>Yet linked with all the laws of time and space.
				<br>A faint, veiled sign of continuities
				<br>That outward eyes can never quite descry;
				<br>Of locked dimensions harbouring years gone by,
				<br>And out of reach except for hidden keys.

				<p>It moves me most when slanting sunbeams glow
				<br>On old farm buildings set against a hill,
				<br>And paint with life the shapes which linger still
				<br>From centuries less a dream than this we know.
				<br>In that strange light I feel I am not far
				<br>From the fixt mass whose sides the ages are.
