The Conscript

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                    I am a peaceful working man,            
                    I am not wise or strong,                
                    But I can follow Nature's plan,         
                    In labour, rest, and song.              
                                                            
                    One day the men that rule us all        
                    Decided we must die,                    
                    Else pride and freedom surely fall      
                    In the dim bye and bye!                 
                                                            
                    They told me I must write my name       
                    Upon a scroll of death;                 
                    That some day I should rise to fame     
                    By giving up my breath.                 
                                                            
                    I do not know what I have done          
                    That I should thus be bound             
                    To wait for tortures one by one         
                    And then an unmark'd mound.             
                                                            
                    I hate no man, and yet they say         
                    That I must fight and kill;             
                    That I must suffer day by day           
                    To please a master's will.              
                                                            
                    I used to have a conscience free,       
                    But now they bid it rest;               
                    They've made a number out of me,        
                    And I must ne'er protest.               
                                                            
                    They tell of trenches, long and deep,   
                    Fill'd with the mangled slain.          
                    They talk till I can scarcely sleep,    
                    So reeling is my brain.                 
                                                            
                    They tell of filth, and blood, and woe; 
                    Of things beyond belief;                
                    Of things that make me tremble so       
                    With mingled fright and grief.          
                                                            
                    I do not know what I shall do -         
                    Is not the law unjust?                  
                    I can't do what they want me to,        
                    And yet they say I must!                
                                                            
                    Each day my doom doth nearer bring;     
                    Each day the State prepares;            
                    Sometimes I feel a watching thing       
                    That stares, and stares, and stares.    
                                                            
                    I never seem to sleep - my head         
                    Whirls in the queerest way.             
                    Why am I chosen to be dead              
                    Upon some fateful day?                  
                                                            
                    Yet hark - some fibre is o'erwrought    
                    A giddying wine I quaff -               
                    Things seem so odd, I can do naught     
                    But laugh, and laugh, and laugh!
