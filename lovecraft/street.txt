   There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be
   those who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I will tell of
   the Street.

   Men of strength and honour fashioned that Street: good valiant men of our
   blood who had come from the Blessed Isles across the sea. At first it was
   but a path trodden by bearers of water from the woodland spring to the
   cluster of houses by the beach. Then, as more men came to the growing
   cluster of houses and looked about for places to dwell, they built cabins
   along the north side, cabins of stout oaken logs with masonry on the side
   toward the forest, for many Indians lurked there with fire-arrows. And in
   a few years more, men built cabins on the south side of the Street.

   Up and down the Street walked grave men in conical hats, who most of the
   time carried muskets or fowling pieces. And there were also their bonneted
   wives and sober children. In the evening these men with their wives and
   children would sit about gigantic hearths and read and speak. Very simple
   were the things of which they read and spoke, yet things which gave them
   courage and goodness and helped them by day to subdue the forest and till
   the fields. And the children would listen and learn of the laws and deeds
   of old, and of that dear England which they had never seen or could not
   remember.

   There was war, and thereafter no more Indians troubled the Street. The
   men, busy with labour, waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how to
   be. And the children grew up comfortable, and more families came from the
   Mother Land to dwell on the Street. And the children's children, and the
   newcomers' children, grew up. The town was now a city, and one by one the
   cabins gave place to houses - simple, beautiful houses of brick and wood,
   with stone steps and iron railings and fanlights over the doors. No flimsy
   creations were these houses, for they were made to serve many a
   generation. Within there were carven mantels and graceful stairs, and
   sensible, pleasing furniture, china, and silver, brought from the Mother
   Land.

   So the Street drank in the dreams of a young people and rejoiced as its
   dwellers became more graceful and happy. Where once had been only strength
   and honour, taste and learning now abode as well. Books and paintings and
   music came to the houses, and the young men went to the university which
   rose above the plain to the north. In the place of conical hats and
   small-swords, of lace and snowy periwigs, there were cobblestones over
   which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many a gilded coach; and
   brick sidewalks with horse blocks and hitching-posts.

   There were in that Street many trees: elms and oaks and maples of dignity;
   so that in the summer, the scene was all soft verdure and twittering
   bird-song. And behind the houses were walled rose-gardens with hedged
   paths and sundials, where at evening the moon and stars would shine
   bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew.

   So the Street dreamed on, past wars, calamities, and change. Once, most of
   the young men went away, and some never came back. That was when they
   furled the old flag and put up a new banner of stripes and stars. But
   though men talked of great changes, the Street felt them not, for its folk
   were still the same, speaking of the old familiar things in the old
   familiar accounts. And the trees still sheltered singing birds, and at
   evening the moon and stars looked down upon dewy blossoms in the walled
   rose-gardens.

   In time there were no more swords, three-cornered hats, or periwigs in the
   Street. How strange seemed the inhabitants with their walking-sticks, tall
   beavers, and cropped heads! New sounds came from the distance - first
   strange puffings and shrieks from the river a mile away, and then, many
   years later, strange puffings and shrieks and rumblings from other
   directions. The air was not quite so pure as before, but the spirit of the
   place had not changed. The blood and soul of their ancestors had fashioned
   the Street. Nor did the spirit change when they tore open the earth to lay
   down strange pipes, or when they set up tall posts bearing weird wires.
   There was so much ancient lore in that Street, that the past could not
   easily be forgotten.

   Then came days of evil, when many who had known the Street of old knew it
   no more, and many knew it who had not known it before, and went away, for
   their accents were coarse and strident, and their mien and faces
   unpleasing. Their thoughts, too, fought with the wise, just spirit of the
   Street, so that the Street pined silently as its houses fell into decay,
   and its trees died one by one, and its rose-gardens grew rank with weeds
   and waste. But it felt a stir of pride one day when again marched forth
   young men, some of whom never came back. These young men were clad in
   blue.

   With the years, worse fortune came to the Street. Its trees were all gone
   now, and its rose-gardens were displaced by the backs of cheap, ugly new
   buildings on parallel streets. Yet the houses remained, despite the
   ravages of the years and the storms and worms, for they had been made to
   serve many a generation. New kinds of faces appeared in the Street,
   swarthy, sinister faces with furtive eyes and odd features, whose owners
   spoke unfamiliar words and placed signs in known and unknown characters
   upon most of the musty houses. Push-carts crowded the gutters. A sordid,
   undefinable stench settled over the place, and the ancient spirit slept.

   Great excitement once came to the Street. War and revolution were raging
   across the seas; a dynasty had collapsed, and its degenerate subjects were
   flocking with dubious intent to the Western Land. Many of these took
   lodgings in the battered houses that had once known the songs of birds and
   the scent of roses. Then the Western Land itself awoke and joined the
   Mother Land in her titanic struggle for civilization. Over the cities once
   more floated the old flag, companioned by the new flag, and by a plainer,
   yet glorious tricolour. But not many flags floated over the Street, for
   therein brooded only fear and hatred and ignorance. Again young men went
   forth, but not quite as did the young men of those other days. Something
   was lacking. And the sons of those young men of other days, who did indeed
   go forth in olive-drab with the true spirit of their ancestors, went from
   distant places and knew not the Street and its ancient spirit.

   Over the seas there was a great victory, and in triumph most of the young
   men returned. Those who had lacked something lacked it no longer, yet did
   fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over the Street; for many had
   stayed behind, and many strangers had come from distance places to the
   ancient houses. And the young men who had returned dwelt there no longer.
   Swarthy and sinister were most of the strangers, yet among them one might
   find a few faces like those who fashioned the Street and moulded its
   spirit. Like and yet unlike, for there was in the eyes of all a weird,
   unhealthy glitter as of greed, ambition, vindictiveness, or misguided
   zeal. Unrest and treason were abroad amongst an evil few who plotted to
   strike the Western Land its death blow, that they might mount to power
   over its ruins, even as assassins had mounted in that unhappy, frozen land
   from whence most of them had come. And the heart of that plotting was in
   the Street, whose crumbling houses teemed with alien makers of discord and
   echoed with the plans and speeches of those who yearned for the appointed
   day of blood, flame and crime.

   Of the various odd assemblages in the Street, the Law said much but could
   prove little. With great diligence did men of hidden badges linger and
   listen about such places as Petrovitch's Bakery, the squalid Rifkin School
   of Modern Economics, the Circle Social Club, and the Liberty Cafe. There
   congregated sinister men in great numbers, yet always was their speech
   guarded or in a foreign tongue. And still the old houses stood, with their
   forgotten lore of nobler, departed centuries; of sturdy Colonial tenants
   and dewy rose-gardens in the moonlight. Sometimes a lone poet or traveler
   would come to view them, and would try to picture them in their vanished
   glory; yet of such travelers and poets there were not many.

   The rumour now spread widely that these houses contained the leaders of a
   vast band of terrorists, who on a designated day were to launch an orgy of
   slaughter for the extermination of America and of all the fine old
   traditions which the Street had loved. Handbills and papers fluttered
   about filthy gutters; handbills and papers printed in many tongues and in
   many characters, yet all bearing messages of crime and rebellion. In these
   writings the people were urged to tear down the laws and virtues that our
   fathers had exalted, to stamp out the soul of the old America - the soul
   that was bequeathed through a thousand and a half years of Anglo-Saxon
   freedom, justice, and moderation. It was said that the swart men who dwelt
   in the Street and congregated in its rotting edifices were the brains of a
   hideous revolution, that at their word of command many millions of
   brainless, besotted beasts would stretch forth their noisome talons from
   the slums of a thousand cities, burning, slaying, and destroying till the
   land of our fathers should be no more. All this was said and repeated, and
   many looked forward in dread to the fourth day of July, about which the
   strange writings hinted much; yet could nothing be found to place the
   guilt. None could tell just whose arrest might cut off the damnable
   plotting at its source. Many times came bands of blue-coated police to
   search the shaky houses, though at last they ceased to come; for they too
   had grown tired of law and order, and had abandoned all the city to its
   fate. Then men in olive-drab came, bearing muskets, till it seemed as if
   in its sad sleep the Street must have some haunting dreams of those other
   days, when musketbearing men in conical hats walked along it from the
   woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach. Yet could no act be
   performed to check the impending cataclysm, for the swart, sinister men
   were old in cunning.

   So the Street slept uneasily on, till one night there gathered in
   Petrovitch's Bakery, and the Rifkin School of Modern Economics, and the
   Circle Social Club, and Liberty Cafe, and in other places as well, vast
   hordes of men whose eyes were big with horrible triumph and expectation.
   Over hidden wires strange messages traveled, and much was said of still
   stranger messages yet to travel; but most of this was not guessed till
   afterward, when the Western Land was safe from the peril. The men in
   olive-drab could not tell what was happening, or what they ought to do;
   for the swart, sinister men were skilled in subtlety and concealment.

   And yet the men in olive-drab will always remember that night, and will
   speak of the Street as they tell of it to their grandchildren; for many of
   them were sent there toward morning on a mission unlike that which they
   had expected. It was known that this nest of anarchy was old, and that the
   houses were tottering from the ravages of the years and the storms and
   worms; yet was the happening of that summer night a surprise because of
   its very queer uniformity. It was, indeed, an exceedingly singular
   happening, though after all, a simple one. For without warning, in one of
   the small hours beyond midnight, all the ravages of the years and the
   storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and after the crash
   there was nothing left standing in the Street save two ancient chimneys
   and part of a stout brick wall. Nor did anything that had been alive come
   alive from the ruins. A poet and a traveler, who came with the mighty
   crowd that sought the scene, tell odd stories. The poet says that all
   through the hours before dawn he beheld sordid ruins indistinctly in the
   glare of the arc-lights; that there loomed above the wreckage another
   picture wherein he could describe moonlight and fair houses and elms and
   oaks and maples of dignity. And the traveler declares that instead of the
   place's wonted stench there lingered a delicate fragrance as of roses in
   full bloom. But are not the dreams of poets and the tales of travelers
   notoriously false?

   There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be
   those who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I have told you
   of the Street.
