   I have never heard an even approximately adequate explanation of the
   horror at Martin's Beach. Despite the large number of witnesses, no two
   accounts agree; and the testimony taken by local authorities contains the
   most amazing discrepancies.

   Perhaps this haziness is natural in view of the unheard-of character of
   the horror itself, the almost paralytic terror of all who saw it, and the
   efforts made by the fashionable Wavecrest Inn to hush it up after the
   publicity created by Prof. Ahon's article "Are Hypnotic Powers Confined to
   Recognized Humanity?"

   Against all these obstacles I am striving to present a coherent version;
   for I beheld the hideous occurrence, and believe it should be known in
   view of the appalling possibilities it suggests. Martin's Beach is once
   more popular as a watering-place, but I shudder when I think of it.
   Indeed, I cannot look at the ocean at all now without shuddering.

   Fate is not always without a sense of drama and climax, hence the terrible
   happening of August 8, 1922, swiftly followed a period of minor and
   agreeably wonder-fraught excitement at Martin's Beach. On May 17 the crew
   of the fishing smack Alma of Gloucester, under Capt. James P. Orne,
   killed, after a battle of nearly forty hours, a marine monster whose size
   and aspect produced the greatest possible stir in scientific circles and
   caused certain Boston naturalists to take every precaution for its
   taxidermic preservation.

   The object was some fifty feet in length, of roughly cylindrical shape,
   and about ten feet in diameter. It was unmistakably a gilled fish in its
   major affiliations; but with certain curious modifications such as
   rudimentary forelegs and six-toed feet in place of pectoral fins, which
   prompted the widest speculation. Its extraordinary mouth, its thick and
   scaly hide, and its single, deep-set eye were wonders scarcely less
   remarkable than its colossal dimensions; and when the naturalists
   pronounced it an infant organism, which could not have been hatched more
   than a few days, public interest mounted to extraordinary heights.

   Capt. Orne, with typical Yankee shrewdness, obtained a vessel large enough
   to hold the object in its hull, and arranged for the exhibition of his
   prize. With judicious carpentry he prepared what amounted to an excellent
   marine museum, and, sailing south to the wealthy resort district of
   Martin's Beach, anchored at the hotel wharf and reaped a harvest of
   admission fees.

   The intrinsic marvelousness of the object, and the importance which it
   clearly bore in the minds of many scientific visitors from near and far,
   combined to make it the season's sensation. That it was absolutely unique
   - unique to a scientifically revolutionary degree - was well understood.
   The naturalists had shown plainly that it radically differed from the
   similarly immense fish caught off the Florida coast; that, while it was
   obviously an inhabitant of almost incredible depths, perhaps thousands of
   feet, its brain and principal organs indicated a development startlingly
   vast, and out of all proportion to anything hitherto associated with the
   fish tribe.

   On the morning of July 20 the sensation was increased by the loss of the
   vessel and its strange treasure. In the storm of the preceding night it
   had broken from its moorings and vanished forever from the sight of man,
   carrying with it the guard who had slept aboard despite the threatening
   weather. Capt. Orne, backed by extensive scientific interests and aided by
   large numbers of fishing boats from Gloucester, made a thorough and
   exhaustive searching cruise, but with no result other than the prompting
   of interest and conversation. By August 7 hope was abandoned, and Capt.
   Orne had returned to the Wavecrest Inn to wind up his business affairs at
   Martin's Beach and confer with certain of the scientific men who remained
   there. The horror came on August 8.

   It was in the twilight, when grey sea-birds hovered low near the shore and
   a rising moon began to make a glittering path across the waters. The scene
   is important to remember, for every impression counts. On the beach were
   several strollers and a few late bathers; stragglers from the distant
   cottage colony that rose modestly on a green hill to the north, or from
   the adjacent cliff-perched Inn whose imposing towers proclaimed its
   allegiance to wealth and grandeur.

   Well within viewing distance was another set of spectators, the loungers
   on the Inn's high-ceiled and lantern-lighted veranda, who appeared to be
   enjoying the dance music from the sumptuous ballroom inside. These
   spectators, who included Capt. Orne and his group of scientific confreres,
   joined the beach group before the horror progressed far; as did many more
   from the Inn. Certainly there was no lack of witnesses, confused though
   their stories be with fear and doubt of what they saw.

   There is no exact record of the time the thing began, although a majority
   say that the fairly round moon was "about a foot" above the low-lying
   vapors of the horizon. They mention the moon because what they saw seemed
   subtly connected with it - a sort of stealthy, deliberate, menacing ripple
   which rolled in from the far skyline along the shimmering lane of
   reflected moonbeams, yet which seemed to subside before it reached the
   shore.

   Many did not notice this ripple until reminded by later events; but it
   seems to have been very marked, differing in height and motion from the
   normal waves around it. Some called it cunning and calculating. And as it
   died away craftily by the black reefs afar out, there suddenly came
   belching up out of the glitter-streaked brine a cry of death; a scream of
   anguish and despair that moved pity even while it mocked it.

   First to respond to the cry were the two life guards then on duty; sturdy
   fellows in white bathing attire, with their calling proclaimed in large
   red letters across their chests. Accustomed as they were to rescue work,
   and to the screams of the drowning, they could find nothing familiar in
   the unearthly ululation; yet with a trained sense of duty they ignored the
   strangeness and proceeded to follow their usual course.

   Hastily seizing an air-cushion, which with its attached coil of rope lay
   always at hand, one of them ran swiftly along the shore to the scene of
   the gathering crowd; whence, after whirling it about to gain momentum, he
   flung the hollow disc far out in the direction from which the sound had
   come. As the cushion disappeared in the waves, the crowd curiously awaited
   a sight of the hapless being whose distress had been so great; eager to
   see the rescue made by the massive rope.

   But that rescue was soon acknowledged to be no swift and easy matter; for,
   pull as they might on the rope, the two muscular guards could not move the
   object at the other end. Instead, they found that object pulling with
   equal or even greater force in the very opposite direction, till in a few
   seconds they were dragged off their feet and into the water by the strange
   power which had seized on the proffered life-preserver.

   One of them, recovering himself, called immediately for help from the
   crowd on the shore, to whom he flung the remaining coil of rope; and in a
   moment the guards were seconded by all the hardier men, among whom Capt.
   Orne was foremost. More than a dozen strong hands were now tugging
   desperately at the stout line, yet wholly without avail.

   Hard as they tugged, the strange force at the other end tugged harder; and
   since neither side relaxed for an instant, the rope became rigid as steel
   with the enormous strain. The struggling participants, as well as the
   spectators, were by this time consumed with curiosity as to the nature of
   the force in the sea. The idea of a drowning man had long been dismissed;
   and hints of whales, submarines, monsters, and demons now passed freely
   around. Where humanity had first led the rescuers, wonder kept them at
   their task; and they hauled with a grim determination to uncover the
   mystery.

   It being decided at last that a whale must have swallowed the air-cushion,
   Capt. Orne, as a natural leader, shouted to those on shore that a boat
   must be obtained in order to approach, harpoon, and land the unseen
   leviathan. Several men at once prepared to scatter in quest of a suitable
   craft, while others came to supplant the captain at the straining rope,
   since his place was logically with whatever boat party might be formed.
   His own idea of the situation was very broad, and by no means limited to
   whales, since he had to do with a monster so much stranger. He wondered
   what might be the acts and manifestations of an adult of the species of
   which the fifty-foot creature had been the merest infant.

   And now there developed with appalling suddenness the crucial fact which
   changed the entire scene from one of wonder to one of horror, and dazed
   with fright the assembled band of toilers and onlookers. Capt. Orne,
   turning to leave his post at the rope, found his hands held in their place
   with unaccountable strength; and in a moment he realized that he was
   unable to let go of the rope. His plight was instantly divined, and as
   each companion tested his own situation the same condition was
   encountered. The fact could not be denied - every struggler was
   irresistibly held in some mysterious bondage to the hempen line which was
   slowly, hideously, and relentlessly pulling them out to sea.

   Speechless horror ensued; a horror in which the spectators were petrified
   to utter inaction and mental chaos. Their complete demoralization is
   reflected in the conflicting accounts they give, and the sheepish excuses
   they offer for their seemingly callous inertia. I was one of them, and
   know.

   Even the strugglers, after a few frantic screams and futile groans,
   succumbed to the paralyzing influence and kept silent and fatalistic in
   the face of unknown powers. There they stood in the pallid moonlight,
   blindly pulling against a spectral doom and swaying monotonously backward
   and forward as the water rose first to their knees, then to their hips.
   The moon went partly under a cloud, and in the half-light the line of
   swaying men resembled some sinister and gigantic centipede, writhing in
   the clutch of a terrible creeping death.

   Harder and harder grew the rope, as the tug in both directions increased,
   and the strands swelled with the undisturbed soaking of the rising waves.
   Slowly the tide advanced, till the sands so lately peopled by laughing
   children and whispering lovers were now swallowed by the inexorable flow.
   The herd of panic-stricken watchers surged blindly backward as the water
   crept above their feet, while the frightful line of strugglers swayed
   hideously on, half submerged, and now at a substantial distance from their
   audience. Silence was complete.

   The crowd, having gained a huddling-place beyond reach of the tide, stared
   in mute fascination; without offering a word of advice or encouragement,
   or attempting any kind of assistance. There was in the air a nightmare
   fear of impending evils such as the world had never before known.

   Minutes seemed lengthened into hours, and still that human snake of
   swaying torsos was seen above the fast rising tide. Rhythmically it
   undulated; slowly, horribly, with the seal of doom upon it. Thicker clouds
   now passed over the ascending moon, and the glittering path on the waters
   faded nearly out.

   Very dimly writhed the serpentine line of nodding heads, with now and then
   the livid face of a backward-glancing victim gleaming pale in the
   darkness. Faster and faster gathered the clouds, till at length their
   angry rifts shot down sharp tongues of febrile flame. Thunders rolled,
   softly at first, yet soon increasing to a deafening, maddening intensity.
   Then came a culminating crash - a shock whose reverberations seemed to
   shake land and sea alike - and on its heels a cloudburst whose drenching
   violence overpowered the darkened world as if the heavens themselves had
   opened to pour forth a vindictive torrent.

   The spectators, instinctively acting despite the absence of conscious and
   coherent thought, now retreated up the cliff steps to the hotel veranda.
   Rumors had reached the guests inside, so that the refugees found a state
   of terror nearly equal to their own. I think a few frightened words were
   uttered, but cannot be sure.

   Some, who were staying at the Inn, retired in terror to their rooms; while
   others remained to watch the fast sinking victims as the line of bobbing
   heads showed above the mounting waves in the fitful lightning flashes. I
   recall thinking of those heads, and the bulging eyes they must contain;
   eyes that might well reflect all the fright, panic, and delirium of a
   malignant universe - all the sorrow, sin, and misery, blasted hopes and
   unfulfilled desires, fear, loathing and anguish of the ages since time's
   beginning; eyes alight with all the soul-racking pain of eternally blazing
   infernos.

   And as I gazed out beyond the heads, my fancy conjured up still another
   eye; a single eye, equally alight, yet with a purpose so revolting to my
   brain that the vision soon passed. Held in the clutches of an unknown
   vise, the line of the damned dragged on; their silent screams and
   unuttered prayers known only to the demons of the black waves and the
   night-wind.

   There now burst from the infuriate sky such a mad cataclysm of satanic
   sound that even the former crash seemed dwarfed. Amidst a blinding glare
   of descending fire the voice of heaven resounded with the blasphemies of
   hell, and the mingled agony of all the lost reverberated in one
   apocalyptic, planet-rending peal of Cyclopean din. It was the end of the
   storm, for with uncanny suddenness the rain ceased and the moon once more
   cast her pallid beams on a strangely quieted sea.

   There was no line of bobbing heads now. The waters were calm and deserted,
   and broken only by the fading ripples of what seemed to be a whirlpool far
   out in the path of the moonlight whence the strange cry had first come.
   But as I looked along that treacherous lane of silvery sheen, with fancy
   fevered and senses overwrought, there trickled upon my ears from some
   abysmal sunken waste the faint and sinister echoes of a laugh.
