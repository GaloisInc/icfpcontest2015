A Reminiscence Of Dr. Samuel Johnson

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                                  Written 1917

   The Privilege of Reminiscence, however rambling or tiresome, is one
   generally allow'd to the very aged; indeed, 'tis frequently by means of
   such Recollections that the obscure occurrences of History, and the lesser
   Anecdotes of the Great, are transmitted to Posterity.

   Tho' many of my readers have at times observ'd and remark'd a Sort of
   antique Flow in my Stile of Writing, it hath pleased me to pass amongst
   the Members of this Generation as a young Man, giving out the Fiction that
   I was born in 1890, in America. I am now, however, resolv'd to unburthen
   myself of a Secret which I have hitherto kept thro' Dread of Incredulity;
   and to impart to the Publick a true knowledge of my long years, in order
   to gratifie their taste for authentick Information of an Age with whose
   famous Personages I was on familiar Terms. Be it then known that I was
   born on the family Estate in Devonshire, of the 10th day of August, 1690
   (or in the new Gregorian Stile of Reckoning, the 20th of August), being
   therefore now in my 228th year. Coming early to London, I saw as a Child
   many of the celebrated Men of King William's Reign, including the lamented
   Mr. Dryden, who sat much at the Tables of Will's Coffee-House. With Mr.
   Addison and Dr. Swift I later became very well acquainted, and was an even
   more familiar Friend to Mr. Pope, whom I knew and respected till the Day
   of his Death. But since it is of my more recent Associate, the late Dr.
   Johnson, that I am at this time desir'd to write; I will pass over my
   Youth for the present.

   I had first Knowledge of the Doctor in May of the year 1738, tho' I did
   not at that Time meet him. Mr. Pope had just compleated his Epilogue to
   his Satires (the Piece beginning: "Not twice a Twelvemonth you appear in
   Print."), and had arrang'd for its Publication. On the very Day it
   appear'd, there was also publish'd a Satire in Imitation of Juvenal,
   intitul'd "London", by the then unknown Johnson; and this so struck the
   Town, that many Gentlemen of Taste declared, it was the Work of a greater
   Poet than Mr. Pope. Notwithstanding what some Detractors have said of Mr.
   Pope's petty jealousy, he gave the Verses of his new Rival no small
   Praise; and having learnt thro' Mr. Richardson who the Poet was, told me,
   'that Mr. Johnson wou'd soon be deterre'.

   I had no personal Acquaintance with the Doctor till 1763, when I was
   presented to him at the Mitre Tavern by Mr. James Boswell, a young
   Scotchman of excellent Family and great Learning, but small Wit, whose
   metrical Effusions I had sometimes revis'd.

   Dr. Johnson, as I beheld him, was a full, pursy Man, very ill drest, and
   of slovenly Aspect. I recall him to have worn a bushy Bob-Wig, untyed and
   without Powder, and much too small for his Head. His cloaths were of rusty
   brown, much wrinkled, and with more than one Button missing. His Face, too
   full to be handsom, was likewise marred by the Effects of some scrofulous
   Disorder; and his Head was continually rolling about in a sort of
   convulsive way. Of this Infirmity, indeed, I had known before; having
   heard of it from Mr. Pope, who took the Trouble to make particular
   Inquiries.

   Being nearly seventy-three, full nineteen Years older than Dr. Johnson (I
   say Doctor, tho' his Degree came not till two Years afterward), I
   naturally expected him to have some Regard for my Age; and was therefore
   not in that Fear of him, which others confess'd. On my asking him what he
   thought of my favourable Notice of his Dictionary in The Londoner, my
   periodical Paper, he said: Sir, I possess no Recollection of having
   perus'd your Paper, and have not a great Interest in the Opinions of the
   less thoughtful Part of Mankind." Being more than a little piqued at the
   Incivility of one whose Celebrity made me solicitous of his Approbation, I
   ventur'd to retaliate in kind, and told him, I was surpris'd that a Man of
   Sense shou'd judge the Thoughtfulness of one whose Productions he admitted
   never having read. "Why, Sir," reply'd Johnson, "I do not require to
   become familiar with a Man's Writings in order to estimate the
   Superficiality of his Attainments, when he plainly skews it by his
   Eagerness to mention his own Productions in the first Question he puts to
   me." Having thus become Friends, we convers'd on many Matters. When, to
   agree with him, I said I was distrustful of the Authenticity of Ossian's
   Poems, Mr. Johnson said: "That, Sir, does not do your Understanding
   particular Credit; for what all the Town is sensible of, is no great
   Discovery for a Grub-Street Critick to make. You might as well say, you
   have a strong Suspicion that Milton wrote Paradise Lost!"

   I thereafter saw Johnson very frequently, most often at Meetings of THE
   LITERARY CLUB, which was founded the next Year by the Doctor, together
   with Mr. Burke, the parliamentary Orator, Mr. Beauclerk, a Gentleman of
   Fashion, Mr. Langton, a pious Man and Captain of Militia, Sir J. Reynolds,
   the widely known Painter, Dr. Goldsmith, the prose and poetick Writer, Dr.
   Nugent, father-in-law to Mr. Burke, Sir John Hawkins, Mr. Anthony
   Charmier, and my self. We assembled generally at seven o'clock of an
   Evening, once a Week, at the Turk's-Head, in Gerrard-Street, Soho, till
   that Tavern was sold and made into a private Dwelling; after which Event
   we mov'd our Gatherings successively to Prince's in Sackville-Street, Le
   Tellier's in Dover-Street, and Parsloe's and The Thatched House in St.
   James's-Street. In these Meetings we preserv'd a remarkable Degree of
   Amity and Tranquillity, which contrasts very favourably with some of the
   Dissensions and Disruptions I observe in the literary and amateur Press
   Associations of today. This Tranquillity was the more remarkable, because
   we had amongst us Gentlemen of very opposed Opinions. Dr. Johnson and I,
   as well as many others, were high Tories; whilst Mr. Burke was a Whig, and
   against the American War, many of his Speeches on that Subject having been
   widely publish'd. The least congenial Member was one of the Founders, Sir
   John Hawkins, who hath since written many misrepresentations of our
   Society. Sir John, an eccentrick Fellow, once declin'd to pay his part of
   the Reckoning for Supper, because 'twas his Custom at Home to eat no
   Supper. Later he insulted Mr. Burke in so intolerable a Manner, that we
   all took Pains to shew our Disapproval; after which Incident he came no
   more to our Meetings. However, he never openly fell out with the Doctor,
   and was the Executor of his Will; tho' Mr. Boswell and others have Reason
   to question the genuineness of his Attachment. Other and later Members of
   the CLUB were Mr. David Garrick, the Actor and early Friend of Dr.
   Johnson, Messieurs Tho. and Jos. Warton, Dr. Adam Smith, Dr. Percy, Author
   of the Reliques, Mr. Edw. Gibbon, the Historian, Dr. Burney, the Musician,
   Mr. Malone, the Critick, and Mr. Boswell. Mr. Garrick obtain'd Admittance
   only with Difficulty; for the Doctor, notwithstanding his great
   Friendship, was for ever affecting to decry the Stage and all Things
   connected with it. Johnson, indeed, had a most singular Habit of speaking
   for Davy when others were against him, and of arguing against him, when
   others were for him. I have no Doubt that he sincerely lov'd Mr. Garrick,
   for he never alluded to him as he did to Foote, who was a very coarse
   Fellow despite his comick Genius. Mr. Gibbon was none too well lik'd, for
   he had an odious sneering Way which offended even those of us who most
   admir'd his historical Productions. Mr. Goldsmith, a little Man very vain
   of his Dress and very deficient in Brilliancy of Conversation, was my
   particular Favourite; since I was equally unable to shine in the
   Discourse. He was vastly jealous of Dr. Johnson, tho' none the less liking
   and respecting him. I remember that once a Foreigner, a German, I think,
   was in our Company; and that whilst Goldsmith was speaking, he observ'd
   the Doctor preparing to utter something. Unconsciously looking upon
   Goldsmith as a meer Encumbrance when compar'd to the greater Man, the
   Foreigner bluntly interrupted him and incurr'd his lasting Hostility by
   crying, "Hush, Toctor Shonson iss going to speak!"

   In this luminous Company I was tolerated more because of my Years than for
   my Wit or Learning; being no Match at all for the rest. My Friendship for
   the celebrated Monsieur Voltaire was ever a Cause of Annoyance to the
   Doctor; who was deeply orthodox, and who us'd to say of the French
   Philosopher: "Vir est acerrimi Ingenii et paucarum Literarum."

   Mr. Boswell, a little teazing Fellow whom I had known for some Time
   previously, us'd to make Sport of my aukward Manners and old-fashion'd Wig
   and Cloaths. Once coming in a little the worse for Wine (to which he was
   addicted) he endeavour'd to lampoon me by means of an Impromptu in verse,
   writ on the Surface of the Table; but lacking the Aid he usually had in
   his Composition, he made a bad grammatical Blunder. I told him, he shou'd
   not try to pasquinade the Source of his Poesy. At another Time Bozzy (as
   we us'd to call him) complain'd of my Harshness toward new Writers in the
   Articles I prepar'd for The Monthly Review. He said, I push'd every
   Aspirant off the Slopes of Parnassus. "Sir," I reply'd, "you are mistaken.
   They who lose their Hold do so from their own Want of Strength; but
   desiring to conceal their Weakness, they attribute the Absence of Success
   to the first Critick that mentions them." I am glad to recall that Dr.
   Johnson upheld me in this Matter.

   Dr. Johnson was second to no Man in the Pains he took to revise the bad
   Verses of others; indeed, 'tis said that in the book of poor blind old
   Mrs. Williams, there are scarce two lines which are not the Doctor's. At
   one Time Johnson recited to me some lines by a Servant to the Duke of
   Leeds, which had so amus'd him, that he had got them by Heart. They are on
   the Duke's Wedding, and so much resemble in Quality the Work of other and
   more recent poetick Dunces, that I cannot forbear copying them:

     "When the Duke of Leeds shall marry'd be
     To a fine young Lady of high Quality
     How happy will that Gentlewoman be
     In his Grace of Leeds' good Company."

   I ask'd the Doctor, if he had ever try'd making Sense of this Piece; and
   upon his saying he had not, I amus'd myself with the following Amendment
   of it:

     When Gallant LEEDS auspiciously shall wed
     The virtuous Fair, of antient Lineage bred,
     How must the Maid rejoice with conscious Pride
     To win so great an Husband to her Side!

   On shewing this to Dr. Johnson, he said, "Sir, you have straightened out
   the Feet, but you have put neither Wit nor Poetry into the Lines."

   It wou'd afford me Gratification to tell more of my Experiences with Dr.
   Johnson and his circle of Wits; but I am an old Man, and easily fatigued.
   I seem to ramble along without much Logick or Continuity when I endeavour
   to recall the Past; and fear I light upon but few Incidents which others
   have not before discuss'd. Shou'd my present Recollections meet with
   Favour, I might later set down some further Anecdotes of old Times of
   which I am the only Survivor. I recall many things of Sam Johnson and his
   Club, having kept up my Membership in the Latter long after the Doctor's
   Death, at which I sincerely mourn'd. I remember how John Burgoyne, Esq.,
   the General, whose Dramatick and Poetical Works were printed after his
   Death, was blackballed by three Votes; probably because of his unfortunate
   Defeat in the American War, at Saratoga. Poor John! His Son fared better,
   I think, and was made a Baronet. But I am very tired. I am old, very old,
   and it is Time for my Afternoon Nap.
