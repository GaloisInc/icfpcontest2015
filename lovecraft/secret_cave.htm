<p>"Now be good children" Said Mrs. Lee "While I am away & dont get into mischief". Mr. & Mrs. Lee were going off for the day & To leave The Two children John 10 yrs old & Alice 2 yrs old&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes" replied John
<p>As Soon as The Elder Lees were away the younger Lees went down cellar & began to rummage among the rubbish&nbsp;&nbsp;little alice leaned against the wall watching John. As John was making a boat of barrel staves the Little girl gave a piercing cry as the bricks behind her crumbled away&nbsp;&nbsp;he rushed up to her & Lifted her out screaming loudly&nbsp;&nbsp;as soon as her screams subsided she said "the wall went away"&nbsp;&nbsp;John went up & saw that there was a passage&nbsp;&nbsp;he said to the little girl "lets come & see what this is"&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes" she said&nbsp;&nbsp;the entered the place&nbsp;&nbsp;they could stand up it&nbsp;&nbsp;the passage was farther than they could see they&nbsp;&nbsp;John went back upstairs & went to the kitchen drawer & got 2 candles & some matches & then they went back to the cellar passage. the two once more entered&nbsp;&nbsp;there was plastering on the walls ceiling & floor&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing was visible but a box&nbsp;&nbsp;this was for a seat nevertheless they examined it & found it to contain nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;the walked on farther & pretty soon the plastering left off & they were in a cave&nbsp;&nbsp;Little alice was frightened at first but at her brothers assurance that it was "all right" she allayed her fears. soon they came to a small box which John took up & carried within&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty soon they came on a <i>boat</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;in it were two oars&nbsp;&nbsp;he dragged it with difficulty along with him&nbsp;&nbsp;soon they found the passage came to an abrupt stop&nbsp;&nbsp;he pulled the obstacle away & to his dismay water rushed in in torrents&nbsp;&nbsp;John was an expert swimmer & long breathede&nbsp;&nbsp;he had just taken a breath so he tried to rise but with the box & his sister he found it quite impossible then he caught sight of the boat rising&nbsp;&nbsp;he grasped it - - - - - -
<p>The next he knew he was on the surface clinging tightly to the body of his sister & the mysterious box&nbsp;&nbsp;he could not imagine how the water got in but a new peril menaced them&nbsp;&nbsp;if the water continued rising it would rise to the top&nbsp;&nbsp;suddenly a thought presented itself. he could shut off the water&nbsp;&nbsp;he speedily did this & lifting the now lifeless body of his sister into the boat he himself climed in & sailed down the passage&nbsp;&nbsp;it was gruesome & uncanny absolutely dark his candle being put out by the flood & a dead body lying near&nbsp;&nbsp;he did not gaze about him but rowed for his life&nbsp;&nbsp;when he did look up he was floating in his own cellar&nbsp;&nbsp;he quickly rushed up stairs with the body, to find his parents had come home&nbsp;&nbsp;He told them the story
<p align="center">* * * * *
<p>The funeral of alice occupied so much time that John quite forgot about the box&#8212;but when they <i>did</i> open it they found it to be a <i>solid gold</i> chunk worth about $10,000&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to pay for anything but the death of his sister.
