                               The Burns's Tomb.

   It was noon in the Little village of Mainville, and a sorrowful group of
   people were standing around the Burns's Tomb. Joseph Burns was dead. (when
   dying, he had given the following strange orders:-"Before you put my body
   in the tomb, drop this ball onto the floor, at a spot marked "A"." he then
   handed a small golden ball to the rector.) The people greatly regretted
   his death. After The funeral services were finished, Mr Dobson (the
   rector) said, "My friends, I will now gratify the last wishes of the
   deceased. So saying, he descended into the tomb. (to lay the ball on the
   spot marked "A") Soon the funeral party Began to be impatient, and after a
   time Mr. Cha's. Greene (the Lawyer) descended to make a search. Soon he
   came up with a frightened face, and said, "Mr Dobson is not there"!

                                   Chapter II
                              Mysterious Mr. Bell.

   It was 3.10 o'clock in ye afternoone whenne The door bell of the Dobson
   mansion rang loudly, and the servant on going to the door, found an
   elderly man, with black hair, and side whiskers. He asked to see Miss
   Dobson. Upon arriving in her presence he said, "Miss Dobson, I know where
   your father is, and for -L-10,000 I will restore him.

   My name is Mr. Bell." "Mr Bell," said Miss Dobson, "will you excuse me
   from the room a moment?" "Certainly". replied Mr Bell. In a short time she
   returned, and said, "Mr. Bell, I understand you. You have abducted my
   father, and hold him for a ransom"

                                  Chapter III
                             At The Police Station.

   It was 3.20 o'clock in the afternoon when the telephone bell at the North
   End Police Station rang furiously, and Gibson, (the telephone Man)
   Inquired what was the matter,

   "Have found out about fathers dissapearance"! a womans voice said. "Im
   Miss Dobson, and father has been abducted, "Send King John"! King John was
   a famous western detective. Just then a man rushed in, and shouted, "Oh!
   Terrors! Come To the Graveyard!"

                                The West window.

   Now let us return to the Dobson Mansion. Mr Bell was rather taken aback by
   Miss Dobson's plain speaking, but when he recovered his speech he said,
   "Don't put it quite so plain, Miss Dobson, for I&#8212" He was interrupted
   by the entrance of King John, who with a brace of revolvers in his hands,
   barred all egress by the doorway. But quicker than thought Bell sprang to
   a west window,&#8212and jumped.

                            The Secret of The grave.

   Now let us return to the station house. After the exited visitor had
   calmed somewhat, he could tell his story straighter. He had seen three men
   in the graveyard shouting "Bell! Bell! where are you old man!?" and acting
   very suspiciously. He then followed them, and they entered The Burns's
   Tomb! He then followed them in and they touched a spring at a point marked
   "A" and then Dissapeared". "I wish king John were here", Said Gibson,
   "What's your name,"? "John Spratt". replied the visitor.

                              The chase for Bell.

   Now let us return To the Dobson Mansion again:-King John was utterly
   confounded at the Sudden movement of Bell, but when he recovered from his
   surprise, his first thought was of chase. Accordingly, he started in
   pursuit of the abductor. He tracked him down to the R. R. Station and
   found to his dismay that he had taken the train for Kent, a large city
   toward the south, and between which and Mainville there existed no
   telegraph or telephone. The train had just Started!

                               The Negro Hackman.

   The Kent train started at 10.35, and about 10.36 an exited, dusty, and
   tired man* rushed into the Mainville hack. office and said to a negro
   hackman who was standing by the door-"If you can take me to Kent in 15
   minutes I will give you a dollar". "I doan' see how I'm ter git there",
   said the negro "I hab'n't got a decent pair of hosses an' I hab-" "Two
   Dollars"! Shouted The Traveller, "all right" said the Hackman.

                                Bells Surprise.

   It was 11 o'clock at Kent, all of the stores were closed but one, a dingy,
   dirty, little shop, down at the west end. It lay between Kent Harbour, &
   the Kent & Mainville R. R. In the Front room a shabbily dressed person of
   doubtful age was conversing with a middle aged woman with gray haire, "I
   have agreed to do the job, Lindy," he said, "Bell will arrive at 11.30 and
   the carraige is ready to take him down to the wharf, where a ship for
   Africa sails to-nighte".

   "But If King John were to come?" queried "Lindy"

   "Then we'd get nabbed, an' Bell would be hung" Replied The man.

   Just then a rap sounded at the door "Are you Bell"? inquired Lindy "Yes"
   was the response, "And I caught the 10.35 and King John got Left, so we
   are all right". At 11.40 the party reached The Landing, and saw a ship
   Loom up in the darkness. "The Kehdive" "of Africa" was painted on the
   hull, and just as they were to step on board, a man stepped forward in the
   darkness and said "John Bell, I arrest you in the Queen's name"!

   It was King John.

   The daye of The Trial had arrived, and a crowd of people had gathered
   around the Little grove, (which served for a court house in summer) To
   hear the trial of John Bell on the charge of kid-napping.

   "Mr Bell," said the judge "what is the secret of the Burns's tomb"

   "I well tell you this much" said Bell, "If you go into the tomb and touch
   a certain spot marked "A" you will find out"

   "Now where is Mr Dobson"? queried the judge, "Here"! said a voice behind
   them, and The figure of Mr Dobson HIMSELF loomed up in the doorway.

   "How did you get here"!&c was chorused. "Tis a long story," said Dobson.

                                Dobson's Story.

   "When I went down into the tomb," Said Dobson, "Everything was darkness, I
   could see nothing. but Finally I discerned the letter "A" printed in white
   on the onyx floor, I dropped the ball on the Letter, and immediately a
   trap-door opened and a man sprang up. It was this man, here," (he said
   (pointing at Bell, who stood Trembling on the prisoner's docke) "and he
   pulled me down into a brilliantly lighted, and palatial apartment where I
   have Lived until to-day. One day a young man rushed in and exclaimed "The
   secret Is revealed!" and was gone. He did not see me. Once Bell left his
   key behind, and I took the impression in wax, and the next day was spent
   in filing keys to fit the Lock. The next day my key fitted. and the next
   day (which is to-day) I escaped."

                             The Mystery unveiled.

   "Why did the late J. Burns, ask you to put the ball there"? (at "A"?)
   queried the judge? "To get me into trouble" replied Dobson "He, and
   Francis Burns, (his brother) have plotted against me for years, and I knew
   not, in what way they would harm me". "Sieze Francis Burns"! yelled the
   judge.
