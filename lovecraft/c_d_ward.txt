   From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island,
   there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the
   name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most
   reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow
   from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of
   murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent
   contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his
   case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as
   psychological character.

   In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six
   years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly;
   but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the
   very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes
   shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical
   experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack
   of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were
   possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural
   reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything
   heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid
   chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed
   exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the
   right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very
   peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In
   general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had
   become retarded to a degree beyond precedent.

   Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no
   affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of
   treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a
   genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque
   forms. Dr. Willett, who was Ward's family physician, affirms that the
   patient's gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters
   outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the
   seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but
   even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and
   insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was,
   indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital,
   so powerful and lucid did the youth's mind seem; and only on the evidence
   of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of
   information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed
   in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous
   reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and
   shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he
   would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody.

   Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched
   his growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought
   of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a
   terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues.
   Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion
   with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and
   emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief
   which several recalled when Ward's escape became known three hours later.
   That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr. Waite's hospital.
   A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it,
   yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett
   himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems strangely
   easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would
   like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him.
   He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the
   attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not
   there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April breeze
   blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True,
   the dogs howled some time before; but that was while Willett was still
   present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on.
   Ward's father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more
   saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr.
   Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any knowledge or
   complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential friends
   of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even these
   are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains
   is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been
   unearthed.

   Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste
   from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which
   filled every corner of his parents' old mansion in Prospect Street on the
   crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient things
   increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial
   architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything
   else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to remember
   in considering his madness; for although they do not form its absolute
   nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of
   information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern
   matters, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though
   outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit
   questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally
   transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis.
   The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities
   he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through
   sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward
   mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally
   and unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had
   occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him
   that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a
   frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary
   practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to
   have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the
   schools of our own time. Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his
   vitally impaired range of data, the escaped patient manages to cope with
   the complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that he is
   "lying low" in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of
   modern information can be brought up to the normal.

   The beginning of Ward's madness is a matter of dispute among alienists.
   Dr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during
   the boy's last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly turned
   from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and refused to
   qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of
   much greater importance to make. This is certainly borne out by Ward's
   altered habits at the time, especially by his continual search through
   town records and among old burying-grounds for a certain grave dug in
   1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some of whose papers
   he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in
   Olney Court, on Stampers' Hill, which Curwen was known to have built and
   occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20
   saw a great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly stopped his general
   antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult
   subjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent
   search for his forefather's grave.

   From this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his
   verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on
   certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the
   last. Those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him;
   so that his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when
   he tries to write of them. Willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would
   ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which
   culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes
   from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made. Granting
   freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally, and prone to
   be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena
   around him, he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the
   actual passage from sanity to madness; crediting instead Ward's own
   statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on
   human though was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true madness,
   he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and the
   ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places
   had been made, and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and
   secret circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been
   plainly indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and
   inexplicable conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous
   Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patient's memory commenced to exclude
   contemporary images whilst his physical aspect underwent the subtle
   modification so many subsequently noticed.

   It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that
   the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the
   doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to
   sustain the youth's claim regarding his crucial discovery. In the first
   place, two workmen of high intelligence saw Joseph Curwen's ancient papers
   found. Secondly, the boy once shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page
   of the Curwen diary, and each of the documents had every appearance of
   genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed to have found them was long a
   visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them
   in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be
   proved. Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and
   Hutchinson letters, and the problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what
   the detectives brought to light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the
   terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willett's pocket when he
   gained consciousness after his shocking experience.

   And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the
   doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final
   investigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the
   papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those
   papers were borne forever from human knowledge.

                                       2

   One must look back at Charles Ward's earlier life as at something
   belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In
   the autumn of 1918, and with a considerable show of zest in the military
   training of the period, he had begun his junior year at the Moses Brown
   School, which lies very near his home. The old main building, erected in
   1819, had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense; and the spacious
   park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape.
   His social activities were few; and his hours were spent mainly at home,
   in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit of
   antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the
   Public Library, the Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter
   Brown and John Hay Libraries of Brown University, and the newly opened
   Shepley Library in Benefit Street. One may picture him yet as he was in
   those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes and a slight droop,
   dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant impression of harmless
   awkwardness rather than attractiveness.

   His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to
   recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and
   connected picture of the centuries before. His home was a great Georgian
   mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the
   river; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look
   dizzily out over all the clustered spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper
   summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond.
   Here he was born, and from the lovely classic porch of the double-bayed
   brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage; past the
   little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long
   ago overtaken, and on toward the stately colleges along the shady,
   sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden
   houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and
   exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens.

   He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down
   on the steep hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The
   small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for it was up this hill
   that the growing town had climbed; and in these rides he had imbibed
   something of the colour of a quaint colonial village. The nurse used to
   stop and sit on the benches of Prospect Terrace to chat with policemen;
   and one of the child's first memories was of the great westward sea of
   hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter
   afternoon from that great railed embankment, and violet and mystic against
   a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious
   greens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive
   silhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of
   the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.

   When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently
   dragged nurse, and then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther
   down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture, each time reaching
   older and quainter levels of the ancient city. He would hesitate gingerly
   down vertical Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to
   the shady Benefit Street corner, where before him was a wooden antique
   with an Ionic-pilastered pair of doorways, and beside him a prehistoric
   gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining, and the great
   Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of Georgian grandeur. It was
   getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over
   the place, and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the
   pre-Revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic
   portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed
   double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as
   they were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the
   painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible.

   Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old
   "Town Street" that the founders had laid out at the river's edge in 1636.
   Here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense
   antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to
   thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a
   gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue
   along Benefit Street past the iron fence of St. John's hidden churchyard
   and the rear of the 1761 Colony House and the mouldering bulk of the
   Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting Street - the
   successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods - he would look
   upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway
   had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing
   the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the
   ancient Sign of Shakespeare's Head where the Providence Gazette and
   Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite
   First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple,
   and the Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward
   the neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group
   of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the
   precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping
   to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old water-front recalls its
   proud East India days amidst polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves,
   and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such surviving alley names as
   Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar,
   Dime, and Cent.

   Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would
   venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms,
   tumbling steps, twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours;
   winding from South Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the
   bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this
   lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at
   the Great Bridge, where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its
   ancient arches. In that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering
   beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff, decked with its
   two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as
   London is crowned by St. Paul's. He like mostly to reach this point in the
   late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and
   the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws magic around the
   dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at anchor. After a
   long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poet's love for the sight, and
   then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white
   church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin
   to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over
   double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings.

   At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts;
   spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his
   home, where the hill drops to the lower eminence of Stampers' Hill with
   its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the Boston
   stage coach used to start before the Revolution, and the other half in the
   gracious southerly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams
   Streets, where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of
   walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories
   linger. These rambles, together with the diligent studies which
   accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian
   lore which at last crowded the modern world from Charles Ward's mind; and
   illustrate the mental soil upon which fell, in that fateful winter of
   1919-20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition.

   Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change,
   Charles Ward's antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid.
   Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness
   and historic value, and of anything like violence or savage instinct he
   was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop
   a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before;
   when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very
   long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of
   1692, and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting
   stories clustered.

   Ward's great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a
   certain 'Ann Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James
   Tillinghast,'  of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late
   in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript,
   the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of
   name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen,
   resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of
   Tillinghast; on the ground 'that her Husband's name was become a public
   Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his Decease; the which
   confirming an antient common Rumour, tho' not to be credited by a loyall
   Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting.'

   This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves
   which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured
   revision of the page numbers.

   It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a
   hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly
   excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered
   allusions relating to this person; about whom there remained so few
   publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in
   modern times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot
   him from memory. What did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and
   provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it
   was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or
   to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.

   Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph
   Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own
   relationship to this apparently "hushed-up" character, he proceeded to
   hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning
   him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest
   expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs
   in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating
   passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to
   destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York,
   where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum
   at Fraunces' Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr,
   Willett's opinion formed the definite source of Ward's undoing, was the
   matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in
   Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black
   vistas whose end was deeper than the pit.

                         II. An Antecedent and a Horror

                                       1

   Joseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what Ward
   heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely
   horrible individual. He had fled from Salem to Providence - that universal
   haven of the odd, the free, and the dissenting - at the beginning of the
   great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation because of his
   solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments. He was a
   colourless-looking man of about thirty, and was soon found qualified to
   become a freeman of Providence; thereafter buying a home lot just north of
   Gregory Dexter's at about the foot of Olney Street. His house was built on
   Stampers' Hill west of the Town Street, in what later became Olney Court;
   and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one, on the same site, which is
   still standing.

   Now the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to
   grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping
   enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the
   Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the
   Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain his
   nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As
   decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but
   Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers,
   and practised a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such
   simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of
   the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all
   hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone
   to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was
   held, for the most part, that Curwen's incessant mixings and boilings of
   chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange
   substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased
   in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from
   Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the
   Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs,
   acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered
   from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and
   secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for
   aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal
   way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their
   requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved
   of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the
   stranger's advent, and without producing more than five years' apparent
   change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly;
   and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had
   always shewn.

   Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of
   other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally
   shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which he was
   glimpsed at all hours, and under all conditions, was notorious; though no
   one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed
   ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived
   during the summer, and to which he would frequently be seen riding at
   various odd times of the day or night. Here his only visible servants,
   farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged Narragansett Indians;
   the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the wife of a very repulsive
   cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture of negro blood. In the
   lead-to of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical
   experiments were conducted. Curious porters and teamers who delivered
   bottles, bags, or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of
   the fantastic flasks, crucibles, alembics, and furnaces they saw in the
   low shelved room; and prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed
   "chymist" - by which they meant alchemist - would not be long in finding
   the Philosopher's Stone. The nearest neighbours to this farm - the
   Fenners, a quarter of a mile away - had still queerer things to tell of
   certain sounds which they insisted came from the Curwen place in the
   night. There were cries, they said, and sustained howlings; and they did
   not like the large numbers of livestock which thronged the pastures, for
   no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants
   in meat, milk, and wool. The identity of the stock seemed to change from
   week to week as new droves were purchased from the Kingstown farmers.
   Then, too, there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone
   outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windows.

   Great Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwen's town house in
   Olney Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man must
   have been nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed one with
   the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took the
   peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition. Here there was less
   mystery, it is true; but the hours at which lights were seen, the
   secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only
   menservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged French
   housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which
   only four persons lived, and the quality of certain voices often heard in
   muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times, all combined with what
   was known of the Pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name.

   In choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed; for
   as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of
   the town, he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort, whose
   company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy. His
   birth was known to be good, since the Curwens or Corwins of Salem needed
   no introduction in New England. It developed that Joseph Curwen had
   travelled much in very early life, living for a time in England and making
   at least two voyages to the Orient; and his speech, when he deigned to use
   it, was that of a learned and cultivated Englishman. But for some reason
   or other Curwen did not care for society. Whilst never actually rebuffing
   a visitor, he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of
   anything to say to him which would not sound inane.

   There seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance, as
   if he had come to find all human beings dull though having moved among
   stranger and more potent entities. When Dr. Checkley the famous wit came
   from Boston in 1738 to be rector of King's Church, he did not neglect
   calling on one of whom he soon heard so much; but left in a very short
   while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his host's
   discourse. Charles Ward told his father, when they discussed Curwen one
   winter evening, that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old
   man had said to the sprightly cleric, but that all diarists agree
   concerning Dr. Checkley's reluctance to repeat anything he had heard. The
   good man had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph Curwen
   without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed.

   More definite, however, was the reason why another man of taste and
   breeding avoided the haughty hermit. In 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly
   English gentleman of literary and scientific leanings, came from Newport
   to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing, and built a
   fine country seat on the Neck in what is now the heart of the best
   residence section. He lived in considerable style and comfort, keeping the
   first coach and liveried servants in town, and taking great pride in his
   telescope, his microscope, and his well-chosen library of English and
   Latin books. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the best library in
   Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was more cordially
   received than most other callers at the house had been. His admiration for
   his host's ample shelves, which besides the Greek, Latin, and English
   classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical,
   mathematical, and scientific works including Paracelsus, Agricola, Van
   Helmont, Sylvius, Glauber, Boyle, Boerhaave, Becher, and Stahl, led Curwen
   to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never
   invited anyone before; and the two drove out at once in Mr. Merritt's
   coach.

   Mr. Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the
   farmhouse, but maintained that the titles of the books in the special
   library of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which
   Curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a
   lasting loathing. Perhaps, however, the facial expression of the owner in
   exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice. This bizarre
   collection, besides a host of standard works which Mr. Merritt was not too
   alarmed to envy, embraced nearly all the cabbalists, daemonologists, and
   magicians known to man; and was a treasure-house of lore in the doubtful
   realms of alchemy and astrology. Hermes Trismegistus in Mesnard's edition,
   the Turba Philosophorum, Geber's Liber Investigationis, and Artephius's
   Key of Wisdom all were there; with the cabbalistic Zohar, Peter Jammy's
   set of Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lully's Ars Magna et Ultima in Zetsner's
   edition, Roger Bacon's Thesaurus Chemicus, Fludd's Clavis Alchimiae, and
   Trithemius's De Lapide Philosophico crowding them close. Mediaeval Jews
   and Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned pale when,
   upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as the
   Qanoon-e-Islam, he found it was in truth the forbidden Necronomicon of the
   mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, of which he had heard such monstrous things
   whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at
   the strange little fishing village of Kingsport, in the province of the
   Massachussetts-Bay.

   But oddly enough, the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably
   disquieted by a mere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay
   face downwards a badly worn copy of Borellus, bearing many cryptical
   marginalia and interlineations in Curwen's hand. The book was open at
   about its middle, and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous
   pen-strokes beneath the lines of mystic black-letter that the visitor
   could not resist scanning it through. Whether it was the nature of the
   passage underscored, or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed
   the underscoring, he could not tell; but something in that combination
   affected him very badly and very peculiarly. He recalled it to the end of
   his days, writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to
   recite it to his close friend Dr. Checkley till he saw how greatly it
   disturbed the urbane rector. It read:

     'The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that
     an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and
     raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure; and
     by the lyke Method from the essential Saltes of humane Dust, a
     Philosopher may, without any criminal Necromancy, call up the Shape of
     any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his Bodie has been
     incinerated.'

   It was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street,
   however, that the worst things were muttered about Joseph Curwen. Sailors
   are superstitious folk; and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite
   rum, slave, and molasses sloops, the rakish privateers, and the great
   brigs of the Browns, Crawfords, and Tillinghasts, all made strange furtive
   signs of protection when they saw the slim, deceptively young-looking
   figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the Curwen warehouse
   in Doubloon Street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long
   quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. Curwen's own clerks and
   captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were mongrel riff-raff
   from Martinique, St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It was, in a way,
   the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the
   acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held.
   A crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave, some of its
   members perhaps charged with this errand or that; and when reassembled it
   would be almost sure to lack one or more men. That many of the errands had
   concerned the farm of Pawtuxet Road, and that few of the sailors had ever
   been seen to return from that place, was not forgotten; so that in time it
   became exceedingly difficult for Curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands.
   Almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of
   the Providence wharves, and their replacement in the West Indies became an
   increasingly great problem to the merchant.

   By 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague horrors
   and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they
   could not be named, understood, or even proved to exist. The last straw
   may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758, for in
   March and April of that year two Royal regiments on their way to New
   France were quartered in Providence, and depleted by an inexplicable
   process far beyond the average rate of desertion. Rumour dwelt on the
   frequency with which Curwen was wont to be seen talking with the
   red-coated strangers; and as several of them began to be missed, people
   thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen. What would have
   happened if the regiments had not been ordered on, no one can tell.

   Meanwhile the merchant's worldly affairs were prospering. He had a virtual
   monopoly of the town's trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and cinnamon, and
   easily led any other one shipping establishment save the Browns in his
   importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt, rigging, iron,
   paper, and English goods of every kind. Such shopkeepers as James Green,
   at the Sign of the Elephant in Cheapside, the Russells, at the Sign of the
   Golden Eagle across the Bridge, or Clark and Nightingale at the Frying-Pan
   and Fish near New Coffee-House, depended almost wholly upon him for their
   stock; and his arrangements with the local distillers, the Narragansett
   dairymen and horse-breeders, and the Newport candle-makers, made him one
   of the prime exporters of the Colony.

   Ostracised though he was, he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort. When
   the Colony House burned down, he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by
   which the new brick one - still standing at the head of its parade in the
   old main street - was built in 1761. In that same year, too, he helped
   rebuild the Great Bridge after the October gale. He replaced many of the
   books of the public library consumed in the Colony House fire, and bought
   heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy Market Parade and deep-rutted
   Town Street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or
   "causey" in the middle. About this time, also, he built the plain but
   excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving. When
   the Whitefield adherents broke off from Dr. Cotton's hill church in 1743
   and founded Deacon Snow's church across the Bridge, Curwen had gone with
   them; though his zeal and attendance soon abated. Now, however, he
   cultivated piety once more; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown
   him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if
   not sharply checked.

                                       2

   The sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet
   certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to emerge from
   a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse, was at
   once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is the power
   of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that there came indeed a
   slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him; especially
   after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased. He must
   likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his
   graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at such wanderings;
   whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his Pawtuxet farm
   diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and cattle
   replacement remained abnormally high; but not until modern times, when
   Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley
   Library, did it occur to any person - save one embittered youth, perhaps -
   to make dark comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he
   imported until 1766, and the disturbingly small number for whom he could
   produce bona fide bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the Great
   Bridge or to the planters of the Narragansett Country. Certainly, the
   cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound,
   once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him.

   But of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily
   slight. Curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one
   fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough
   to warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely
   to suffer. His elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have
   been, apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since
   a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had
   gained, it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region
   just then. Judgement demanded that he patch up his relations with the
   townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a signal
   for hushed conversation, transparent excuses or errands elsewhere, and a
   general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His clerks, being now
   reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would
   employ, were giving him much worry; and he held to his sea-captains and
   mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them - a
   mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to
   their welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen
   shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for
   questionable use. During the final five years of his life it seemed as
   though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished
   some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongue's end.

   About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to
   regain his footing in the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now
   determined to contract an advantageous marriage; securing as a bride some
   lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home
   impossible. It may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an
   alliance; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers
   found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them;
   but of this nothing certain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of
   the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would
   be received, hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose
   parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found,
   were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular
   requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security.
   At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and
   oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing
   named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with
   every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt.
   Tillinghast was completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented,
   after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Power's Lane hill, to
   sanction the blasphemous alliance.

   Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been
   reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She
   had attended Stephen Jackson's school opposite the Court-House Parade; and
   had been diligently instructed by her mother, before the latter's death of
   smallpox in 1757, in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A
   sampler of hers, worked in 1753 at the age of nine, may still be found in
   the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mother's death
   she had kept the house, aided only by one old black woman. Her arguments
   with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage must have been
   painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain it is that her
   engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford packet
   Enterprise, was dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph
   Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in
   the presence of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could
   boast; the ceremony being performed by the younger Samuel Winsor. The
   Gazette mentioned the event very briefly. and in most surviving copies the
   item in question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact
   copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note,
   observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language:

     'Monday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was
     married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast,
     a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace
     the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.'

   The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward
   shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of
   Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat
   antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public
   sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the
   Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen
   found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have
   induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no means complete,
   and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at
   all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat torn down. In his
   treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the
   community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new
   house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations,
   and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife
   never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time
   in his long years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity
   with him, this being the youthful ship's officer whose engagement to Eliza
   Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed
   vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now
   gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping
   husband.

   On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwen's only child Ann was born; and was
   christened by the Rev. John Graves of King's Church, of which both husband
   and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to
   compromise between their respective Congregational and Baptist
   affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage
   two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town
   annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the
   greatest difficulty after his discover of the widow's change of name had
   apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the feverish interest
   which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very
   curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr.
   Graves, who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his
   pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution. Ward had tried this source
   because he knew that his great-great-grandmother Ann Tillinghast Potter
   had been an Episcopalian.

   Shortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome
   with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen
   resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted
   Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since
   famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to
   have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney
   Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of
   its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar shewed signs
   of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his
   farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, as was stated, in a condition of
   suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing
   or on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would
   appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm
   the greater number of his volumes on that subject.

   His affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no
   opportunities for helping such leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown,
   and Benjamin West in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town,
   which was then much below the level of Newport in its patronage of the
   liberal arts. He had helped Daniel Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and
   was thereafter his best customer; extending aid likewise to the struggling
   Gazette that appeared each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespeare's Head. In
   politics he ardently supported Governor Hopkins against the Ward party
   whose prime strength was in Newport, and his really eloquent speech at
   Hacher's Hall in 1765 against the setting off of North Providence as a
   separate town with a pro-Ward vote in the General Assembly did more than
   any other thing to wear down the prejudice against him. But Ezra Weeden,
   who watched him closely, sneered cynically at all this outward activity;
   and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick
   with the blackest gulfs of Tartarus. The revengeful youth began a
   systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port;
   spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he
   saw lights in the Curwen warehouses, and following the small boat which
   would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay. He also kept as close
   a watch as possible on the Pawtuxet farm, and was once severely bitten by
   the dogs the old Indian couple loosed upon him.

                                       3

   In 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden, and
   gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of suspense
   and expectancy dropped like an old cloak, giving instant place to an
   ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph. Curwen seemed to have
   difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had
   found or learned or made; but apparently the need of secrecy was greater
   than the longing to share his rejoicing, for no explanation was ever
   offered by him. It was after this transition, which appears to have come
   early in July, that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his
   possession of information which only their long-dead ancestors would seem
   to be able to impart.

   But Curwen's feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this
   change. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more and
   more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now
   bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been. He
   altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its profits were
   constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent at the Pawtuxet
   farm; although there were rumours now and then of his presence in places
   which, though not actually near graveyards, were yet so situated in
   relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough
   the old merchant's change of habits really was. Ezra Weeden, though his
   periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of
   his sea voyaging, had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the
   practical townsfolk and farmers lacked; and subjected Curwen's affairs to
   a scrutiny such as they had never had before.

   Many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchant's vessels had been
   taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times, when every
   colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the Sugar Act which
   hampered a prominent traffick. Smuggling and evasion were the rule in
   Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were
   continuous commonplaces. But Weeden, night after night following the
   lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the Curwen warehouses
   at the Town Street docks, soon felt assured that it was not merely His
   Majesty's armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid.
   Prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained
   chained negroes, who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an
   obscure point on the shore just north of Pawtuxet; being afterward driven
   up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm, where they were locked
   in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only five high narrow slits
   for windows. After that change, however, the whole programme was altered.
   Importation of slaves ceased at once, and for a time Curwen abandoned his
   midnight sailings. Then, about the spring of 1767, a new policy appeared.
   Once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black, silent docks,
   and this time they would go down the bay some distance, perhaps as far as
   Namquit Point, where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships
   of considerable size and widely varied appearance. Curwen's sailors would
   then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore, and transport it
   overland to the farm; locking it in the same cryptical stone building
   which had formerly received the negroes. The cargo consisted almost wholly
   of boxes and cases, of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and
   disturbingly suggestive of coffins.

   Weeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity; visiting it
   each night for long periods, and seldom letting a week go by without a
   sight except when the ground bore a footprint-revealing snow. Even then he
   would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice
   of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left.
   Finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties, he hired a tavern
   companion named Eleazar Smith to continue the survey during his absence;
   and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary
   rumours. That they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of
   publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress
   impossible. Instead, they wished to learn something definite before taking
   any action. What they did learn must have been startling indeed, and
   Charles Ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at Weeden's
   later burning of his notebooks. All that can be told of their discoveries
   is what Eleazar Smith jotted down in a non too coherent diary, and what
   other diarists and letter-writers have timidly repeated from the
   statements which they finally made - and according to which the farm was
   only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace, of a scope and
   depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehension.

   It is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great
   series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of
   persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the farm. The house
   was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous
   stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a
   lean-to toward the north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This
   building stood clear of any other; yet judging by the different voices
   heard at odd times within, it must have been accessible through secret
   passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were mere mumblings and negro
   whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with curious chants or
   invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very singular and
   terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence
   and explosions of frantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversations and
   whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They
   appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping
   accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening.
   Sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house; Curwen,
   certain captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a
   sort that neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before despite their
   wide knowledge of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as
   belonging to this or that nationality. The nature of the conversations
   seemed always a kind of catechism, as if Curwen were extorting some sort
   of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners.

   Weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook, for
   English, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used; but of
   these nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a few
   ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families were
   concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand were
   historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote places
   and ages. Once, for example, an alternately raging and sullen figure was
   questioned in French about the Black Prince's massacre at Limoges in 1370,
   as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know. Curwen asked
   the prisoner - if prisoner he were - whether the order to slay was given
   because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar in the ancient Roman
   crypt beneath the Cathedral, or whether the Dark Man of the Haute Vienne
   had spoken the Three Words. Failing to obtain replies, the inquisitor had
   seemingly resorted to extreme means; for there was a terrific shriek
   followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound.

   None of these colloquies was ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows
   were always heavily draped. Once, though, during a discourse in an unknown
   tongue, a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled Weeden
   exceedingly; reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in
   the autumn of 1764 in Hacher's Hall, when a man from Germantown,
   Pennsylvania, had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as

     'A View of the Famous City of Jerusalem, in which are represented
     Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, his Royal Throne, the noted Towers,
     and Hills, likewise the Suffering of Our Saviour from the Garden of
     Gethsemane to the Cross on the Hill of Golgotha; an artful piece of
     Statuary, Worthy to be seen by the Curious.'

   It was on this occasion that the listener, who had crept close to the
   window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded, gave a start which
   roused the old Indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him. After
   that no more conversations were ever heard in the house, and Weeden and
   Smith concluded that Curwen had transferred his field of action to regions
   below.

   That such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things.
   Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what
   appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure; whilst
   hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the high
   ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found
   an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was obviously an
   entrance to caverns within the hill. When or how these catacombs could
   have been constructed, Weeden was unable to say; but he frequently pointed
   out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen
   workmen from the river. Joseph Curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse
   uses indeed! During the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a
   sharp eye on the steep river-bank to see if any subterrene secrets might
   be washed to light, and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both
   human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the
   banks. Naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the
   rear of a stock farm, and a locality where old Indian bury-grounds were
   common, but Weeden and Smith drew their own inferences.

   It was in January 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating vainly
   on what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering business,
   that the incident of the Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated by the burning of
   the revenue sloop Liberty at Newport during the previous summer, the
   customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an increased vigilance
   concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion His Majesty's armed
   schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charles Leslie, captured after a short
   pursuit one early morning the scow Fortaleza of Barcelona, Spain, under
   Capt. Manuel Arruda, bound according to its log from Grand Cairo, Egypt,
   to Providence. When searched for contraband material, this ship revealed
   the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian
   mummies, consigned to "Sailor A. B. C.", who would come to remove his
   goods in a lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda
   felt himself in honour bound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty at Newport,
   at a loss what to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on
   the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand,
   compromised on Collector Robinson's recommendation by freeing the ship but
   forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later rumours of
   its having been seen in Boston Harbour, though it never openly entered the
   Port of Boston.

   This extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence, and
   there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between
   the cargo of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen. His exotic studies
   and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge, and his
   fondness for graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take much
   imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not
   conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town. As if
   conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took care to speak casually on
   several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies;
   thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural, yet
   stopping just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and Smith, of
   course, felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and
   indulged in the wildest theories concerning Curwen and his monstrous
   labours.

   The following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains; and
   the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen farm.
   Large sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones discovered;
   but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or
   burrows. Something was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about
   a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join
   the placed landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the
   hill from the rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their
   sleepy docks, a vague report went round of things that were floating down
   the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the
   falls. Of course the Pawtuxet in a long river which winds through many
   settled regions abounding in graveyards, and of course the spring rains
   had been very heavy; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the
   wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still waters
   below, or the way that another half cried out although its condition had
   greatly departed from that of objects which normally cried out. That
   rumour sent Smith - for Weeden was just then at sea - in haste to the
   river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the
   evidence of an extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace of a
   passage into the steep bank; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a
   solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the
   extent of some experimental digging, but was deterred by lack of success -
   or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on
   what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been
   ashore at the time.

                                       4

   By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others
   of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together,
   and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and
   vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected
   Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well
   enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently
   influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy
   took place in an upper room of Sabin's Tavern near the docks, with Smith
   present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen
   that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else
   in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen;
   hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince
   him absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and
   enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He would, he said,
   transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned
   and prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and
   following whatever advice they might have to offer. Secrecy would probably
   be essential in any case, for this was no matter that the town constables
   or militia could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd must be
   kept in ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times
   a repetition of that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before
   which had first brought Curwen hither.

   The right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West, whose
   pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar and keen
   thinker; Rev. James Manning, President of the College which had just moved
   up from Warren and was temporarily housed in the new King Street
   schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above
   Presbyterian-Lane; ex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of
   the Philosophical Society at Newport, and was a man of very broad
   perceptions; John Carter, publisher of the Gazette; all four of the Brown
   brothers, John, Joseph, Nicholas, and Moses, who formed the recognised
   local magnates, and of whom Joseph was an amateur scientist of parts; old
   Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was considerable, and who had much
   first-hand knowledge of Curwen's odd purchases; and Capt. Abraham Whipple,
   a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on
   to lead in any active measures needed. These men, if favourable, might
   eventually be brought together for collective deliberation; and with them
   would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the
   Governor of the Colony, Joseph Wanton of Newport, before taking action.

   The mission of Capt. Mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations;
   for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical
   of the possible ghastly side of Weeden's tale, there was not one who did
   not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and coo:rdinated
   action. Curwen, it was clear, formed a vague potential menace to the
   welfare of the town and Colony; and must be eliminated at any cost. Late
   in December 1770 a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of Stephen
   Hopkins and debated tentative measures. Weeden's notes, which he had given
   to Capt. Mathewson, were carefully read; and he and Smith were summoned to
   give testimony anent details. Something very like fear seized the whole
   assemblage before the meeting was over, though there ran through that fear
   a grim determination which Capt. Whipple's bluff and resonant profanity
   best expressed. They would not notify the Governor, because a more than
   legal course seemed necessary. With hidden powers of uncertain extent
   apparently at his disposal, Curwen was not a man who could safely be
   warned to leave town. Nameless reprisals might ensue, and even if the
   sinister creature complied, the removal would be no more than the shifting
   of an unclean burden to another place. The times were lawless, and men who
   had flouted the King's revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk
   at sterner things when duty impelled. Curwen must be surprised at his
   Pawtuxet farm by a large raiding-party of seasoned privateersmen and given
   one decisive chance to explain himself. If he proved a madman, amusing
   himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices, he
   would be properly confined. If something graver appeared, and if the
   underground horrors indeed turned out to be real, he and all with him must
   die. It could be done quietly, and even the widow and her father need not
   be told how it came about.

   While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town
   an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was
   mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moon-light January night
   with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a
   shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window; and
   people around Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically
   along the badly cleared space in front of the Turk's Head. There was a
   baying of dogs in the distance, but this subsided as soon as the clamour
   of the awakened town became audible. Parties of men with lanterns and
   muskets hurried out to see what was happening, but nothing rewarded their
   search. The next morning, however, a giant, muscular body, stark naked,
   was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the Great
   Bridge, where the Long Dock stretched out beside Abbott's distil-house,
   and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and
   whispering. It was not so much the younger as the older folk who
   whispered, for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with
   horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of memory. They, shaking as they did
   so, exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff,
   hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an
   identity - and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years
   before.

   Ezra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying of the
   night before, set out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy Dock Bridge
   whence the sound had come. He had a curious expectancy, and was not
   surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled district where the street
   merged into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very curious tracks in
   the snow. The naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men,
   and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily
   traced. They had given up the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden
   smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to
   their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm of Joseph Curwen, as he well knew
   it would be; and he would have given much had the yard been less
   confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared not seem too interested in full
   daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden went at once with his report,
   performed an autopsy on the strange corpse, and discovered peculiarities
   which baffled him utterly. The digestive tracts of the huge man seemed
   never to have been in use, whilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely
   knit texture impossible to account for. Impressed by what the old men
   whispered of this body's likeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel
   Green, whose great-grandson Aaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwen's
   employ, Weeden asked casual questions till he found where Green was
   buried. That night a party of ten visited the old North Burying Ground
   opposite Herrenden's Lane and opened a grave. They found it vacant,
   precisely as they had expected.

   Meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept
   Joseph Curwen's mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body
   there was found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the
   coo:perating citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied and preserved in
   the private archives of the Smith family where Charles Ward found it, ran
   as follows.

     I delight that you continue in ye Gett'g at Olde Matters in your Way,
     and doe not think better was done at Mr. Hutchinson's in Salem-Village.
     Certainely, there was Noth'g but ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H.
     rais'd upp from What he cou'd gather onlie a part of. What you sente,
     did not Worke, whether because of Any Thing miss'g, or because ye Wordes
     were not Righte from my Speak'g or yr Copy'g. I alone am at a Loss. I
     have not ye Chymicall art to followe Borellus, and owne my Self
     confounded by ye VII. Booke of ye Necronomicon that you recommende. But
     I wou'd have you Observe what was told to us aboute tak'g Care whom to
     calle upp, for you are Sensible what Mr. Mather writ in ye Magnalia of
     ------, and can judge how truely that Horrendous thing is reported. I
     say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by
     the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up Somewhat against you,
     whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser,
     lest the Greater shal not wish to Answer, and shal commande more than
     you. I was frighted when I read of your know'g what Ben Zariatnatmik
     hadde in his ebony Boxe, for I was conscious who must have tolde you.
     And againe I ask that you shalle write me as Jedediah and not Simon. In
     this Community a Man may not live too long, and you knowe my Plan by
     which I came back as my Son. I am desirous you will Acquaint me with
     what ye Black Man learnt from Sylvanus Cocidius in ye Vault, under ye
     Roman Wall, and will be oblig'd for ye lend'g of ye MS. you speak of.

   Another and unsigned letter from Philadelphia provoked equal thought,
   especially for the following passage:

     I will observe what you say respecting the sending of Accounts only by
     yr Vessels, but can not always be certain when to expect them. In the
     Matter spoke of, I require onlie one more thing; but wish to be sure I
     apprehend you exactly. You inform me, that no Part must be missing if
     the finest Effects are to be had, but you can not but know how hard it
     is to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and Burthen to take away the
     whole Box, and in Town (i.e. St. Peter's, St. Paul's, St. Mary's or
     Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all. But I know what
     Imperfections were in the one I rais'd up October last, and how many
     live Specimens you were forc'd to imploy before you hit upon the right
     Mode in the year 1766; so will be guided by you in all Matters. I am
     impatient for yr Brig, and inquire daily at Mr. Biddle's Wharf.

   A third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown
   alphabet. In the Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single oft-repeated
   combination of characters is clumsily copied; and authorities at Brown
   University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic or Abyssinian, although
   they do not recognise the word. None of these epistles was ever delivered
   to Curwen, though the disappearance of Jedediah Orne from Salem as
   recorded shortly afterward shewed that the Providence men took certain
   quiet steps. The Pennsylvania Historical Society also has some curious
   letters received by Dr. Shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome
   character in Philadelphia. But more decisive steps were in the air, and it
   is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old
   privateersmen in the Brown warehouses by night that we must look for the
   main fruits of Weeden's disclosures. Slowly and surely a plan of campaign
   was under development which would leave no trace of Joseph Curwen's
   noxious mysteries.

   Curwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in the
   wind; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look. His coach
   was seen at all hours in the town and on the Pawtuxet Road, and he dropped
   little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly
   sought to combat the town's prejudice. The nearest neighbours to his farm,
   the Fenners, one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the
   sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with
   the high, excessively narrow windows; an event which they quickly
   communicated to John Brown in Providence. Mr. Brown had become the
   executive leader of the select group bent on Curwen's extirpation, and had
   informed the Fenners that some action was about to be taken. This he
   deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the
   final raid; and he explained his course by saying that Curwen was known to
   be a spy of the customs officers at Newport, against whom the hand of
   every Providence skipper, merchant, and farmer was openly or clandestinely
   raised. Whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so
   many queer things is not certain; but at any rate the Fenners were willing
   to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways. To them Mr. Brown had
   entrusted the duty of watching the Curwen farmhouse, and of regularly
   reporting every incident which took place there.

                                       5

   The probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things, as
   suggested by the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action so
   carefully devised by the band of serious citizens. According to the Smith
   diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 p.m. on Friday, April 12th,
   1771, in the great room of Thurston's Tavern at the Sign of the Golden
   Lion on Weybosset Point across the Bridge. Of the guiding group of
   prominent men in addition to the leader John Brown there were present Dr.
   Bowen, with his case of surgical instruments, President Manning without
   the great periwig (the largest in the Colonies) for which he was noted,
   Governor Hopkins, wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his
   seafaring brother Esek, whom he had initiated at the last moment with the
   permission of the rest, John Carter, Capt. Mathewson, and Capt. Whipple,
   who was to lead the actual raiding party. These chiefs conferred apart in
   a rear chamber, after which Capt. Whipple emerged to the great room and
   gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith
   was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the
   arrival of Ezra Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report
   the departure of his coach for the farm.

   About 10:30 a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed by the
   sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there was no need
   of waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for
   his last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment later, as the receding
   coach clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock Bridge, Weeden appeared; and
   the raiders fell silently into military order in the street, shouldering
   the firelocks, fowling-pieces, or whaling harpoons which they had with
   them. Weeden and Smith were with the party, and of the deliberating
   citizens there were present for active service Capt. Whipple, the leader,
   Capt. Esek Hopkins, John Carter, President Manning, Capt. Mathewson, and
   Dr. Bowen; together with Moses Brown, who had come up at the eleventh hour
   though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern. All these
   freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay, grim
   and a trifle apprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock behind and mounted
   the gentle rise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road. Just beyond
   Elder Snow's church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at
   Providence lying outspread under the early spring stars. Steeples and
   gables rose dark and shapely, and salt breezes swept up gently from the
   cove north of the Bridge. Vega was climbing above the great hill across
   the water, whose crest of trees was broken by the roof-line of the
   unfinished College edifice. At the foot of that hill, and along the narrow
   mounting lanes of its side, the old town dreamed; Old Providence, for
   whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to
   be wiped out.

   An hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed, at
   the Fenner farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their intended
   victim. He had reached his farm over half an hour before, and the strange
   light had soon afterward shot once more into the sky, but there were no
   lights in any visible windows. This was always the case of late. Even as
   this news was given another great glare arose toward the south, and the
   party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and
   unnatural wonders. Capt. Whipple now ordered his force to separate into
   three divisions; one of twenty men under Eleazar Smith to strike across to
   the shore and guard the landing-place against possible reinforcements for
   Curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service, a second of
   twenty men under Capt. Esek Hopkins to steal down into the river valley
   behind the Curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door
   in the high, steep bank, and the third to close in on the house and
   adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be led by
   Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows,
   another third to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and
   the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of
   buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal.

   The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a
   single whistle-blast, then wait and capture anything which might issue
   from the regions within. At the sound of two whistle-blasts it would
   advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the
   raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept these
   respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance at the
   first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might
   be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take
   place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of three blasts
   would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; its twenty
   men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both
   farmhouse and stone building. Capt. Whipple's belief in the existence of
   catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into consideration when
   making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness,
   and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final
   reserve at the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistle's range;
   hence would require a special messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown
   and John Carter went with Capt. Hopkins to the river-bank, while President
   Manning was detailed with Capt. Mathewson to the stone building. Dr.
   Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained in Capt. Whipple's party which was to
   storm the farmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger
   from Capt. Hopkins had joined Capt. Whipple to notify him of the river
   party's readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast,
   and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack
   on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left the Fenner
   farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley and
   the hillside door, and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual
   buildings of the Curwen farm.

   Eleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in his
   diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay; broken
   once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and
   again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast
   which seemed to come from the same direction. Later on one man thought he
   caught some distant gunshots, and still later Smith himself felt the throb
   of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air. It was just
   before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous
   unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to
   disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the
   night's doings or of him who had been Joseph Curwen. Something about the
   bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could
   never have conveyed; for though he was a seaman well known to many of
   them, there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set
   him for evermore apart. It was the same later on when they met other old
   companions who had gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had lost or
   gained something imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or heard or
   felt something which was not for human creatures, and could not forget it.
   From them there was never any gossip, for to even the commonest of mortal
   instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that single messenger
   the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own
   lips. Very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them, and
   Eleazar Smith's diary is the only written record which has survived from
   that whole expedition which set forth from the Sign of the Golden Lion
   under the stars.

   Charles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some Fenner
   correspondence which he found in New London, where he knew another branch
   of the family had lived. It seems that the Fenners, from whose house the
   doomed farm was distantly visible, had watched the departing columns of
   raiders; and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the Curwen dogs,
   followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack. This
   blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from
   the stone building, and in another moment, after a quick sounding of the
   second signal ordering a general invasion, there had come a subdued
   prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the
   correspondent Luke Fenner had represented in his epistle by the characters
   'Waaaahrrrrr-R'waaahrrr.'

   This cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing could
   convey, and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely
   at the sound. It was later repeated less loudly, and further but more
   muffled evidences of gunfire ensued; together with a loud explosion of
   powder from the direction of the river. About an hour afterward all the
   dogs began to bark frightfully, and there were vague ground rumblings so
   marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece. A strong smell
   of sulphur was noted; and Luke Fenner's father declared that he heard the
   third or emergency whistle signal, though the others failed to detect it.
   Muffled musketry sounded again, followed by a deep scream less piercing
   but even more horrible than those which had preceded it; a kind of
   throaty, nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must
   have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its
   actual acoustic value.

   Then the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen farm
   ought to lie, and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were
   heard. Muskets flashed and cracked, and the flaming thing fell to the
   ground. A second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human origin was
   plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words
   belched in frenzy: Almighty, protect thy lamb! Then there were more shots,
   and the second flaming thing fell. After that came silence for about
   three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which time little Arthur Fenner,
   Luke's brother, exclaimed that he saw "a red fog" going up to the stars
   from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child can testify
   to this, but Luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic
   of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and
   stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room.

   Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with
   an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have
   prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in
   the Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which any of the Fenners had
   ever encountered before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear
   beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful
   voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered
   out of the sky like a doom, and windows rattled as its echoes died away.
   It was deep and musical; powerful as a bass organ, but evil as the
   forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can tell, for it spoke
   in an unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set down to
   portray the daemoniac intonations: 'DEESMEES JESHET BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA
   ENITEMOSS.' Not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript
   with anything else in mortal knowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he
   recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror
   among black magic's incantations.

   An unmistakable human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this
   malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew
   complex with an added odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly
   different from the scream now burst out, and was protracted ululantly in
   rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate, though
   no auditor could trace any definite words; and at one point it seemed to
   verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Then a yell
   of utter, ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human
   throats - a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which
   it must have burst; after which darkness and silence ruled all things.
   Spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars, though no flames
   appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the
   following day.

   Toward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable
   odours saturating their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested
   a keg of rum, for which they paid very well indeed. One of them told the
   family that the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and that the events of
   the night were not to be mentioned again. Arrogant as the order seemed,
   the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a
   fearsome authority; so that only these furtive letters of Luke Fenner,
   which he urged his Connecticut relative to destroy, remain to tell what
   was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that relative, whereby the
   letters were saved after all, has alone kept the matter from a merciful
   oblivion. Charles Ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass
   of Pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions. Old Charles Slocum of that
   village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour
   concerning a charred, distorted body found in the fields a week after the
   death of Joseph Curwen was announced. What kept the talk alive was the
   notion that this body, so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted
   condition, was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal
   which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.

                                       6

   Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced
   to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which
   survives comes from those outside the final fighting party. There is
   something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed
   each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter. Eight sailors had
   been killed, but although their bodies were not produced their families
   were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had
   occurred. The same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds,
   all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by Dr. Jabez
   Bowen, who had accompanied the party. Hardest to explain was the nameless
   odour clinging to all the raiders, a thing which was discussed for weeks.
   Of the citizen leaders, Capt. Whipple and Moses Brown were most severely
   hurt, and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their
   reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced. Psychologically
   every participant was aged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they
   were all strong men of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with
   more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared
   ill indeed. President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew
   the darkest shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of those
   leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is perhaps
   fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelvemonth afterward Capt.
   Whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship Gaspee, and in this bold
   act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome images.

   There was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden coffin
   of curious design, obviously found ready on the spot when needed, in which
   she was told her husband's body lay. He had, it was explained, been killed
   in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details. More
   than this no tongue ever uttered of Joseph Curwen's end, and Charles Ward
   had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory. This hint was the
   merest thread - a shaky underscoring of a passage in Jedediah Orne's
   confiscated letter to Curwen, as partly copied in Ezra Weeden's
   handwriting. The copy was found in the possession of Smith's descendants;
   and we are left to decide whether Weeden gave it to his companion after
   the end, as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred, or whether,
   as is more probable, Smith had it before, and added the underscoring
   himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd
   guessing and adroit cross-questioning. The underlined passage is merely
   this:

   I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by
   the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up Somewhat against you,
   whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser,
   lest the Greater shal not wish to Answer, and shal commande more than you.

   In the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable
   allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity, Charles
   Ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of Providence killed
   Joseph Curwen.

   The deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from Providence
   life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders.
   They had not at first meant to be so thorough, and had allowed the widow
   and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions;
   but Capt. Tillinghast was an astute man, and soon uncovered enough rumours
   to whet his horror and cause him to demand that the daughter and
   granddaughter change their name, burn the library and all remaining
   papers, and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above Joseph
   Curwen's grave. He knew Capt. Whipple well, and probably extracted more
   hints from that bluff mariner and anyone else ever gained repecting the
   end of the accursed sorcerer.

   From that time on the obliteration of Curwen's memory became increasingly
   rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the town records and
   files of the Gazette. It can be compared in spirit only to the hush that
   lay on Oscar Wilde's name for a decade after his disgrace, and in extent
   only to the fate of that sinful King of Runazar in Lord Dunsany's tale,
   whom the Gods decided must not only cease to be, but must cease ever to
   have been.

   Mrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the house in
   Olney Court and resided with her father in Power's Lane till her death in
   1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living soul, remained to
   moulder through the years; and seemed to decay with unaccountable
   rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing, and by 1800
   even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None ventured to pierce the
   tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which the hillside door may
   have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst
   which Joseph Curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought.

   Only robust old Capt. Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once
   in a while to himself, "Pox on that ------, but he had no business to
   laugh while he screamed. 'Twas as though the damn'd ------ had some'at up
   his sleeve. For half a crown I'd burn his ------ home.'

                         III. A Search and an Evocation

                                       1

   Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from
   Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything
   pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague
   rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself,
   in whom flowed Curwen's blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist
   could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic
   collection of Curwen data.

   In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so
   that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youth's madness from any period
   before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his
   mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and
   with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In
   applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession
   he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused
   scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers
   were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had
   taken place a century and a half before at the Pawtuxet farmhouse whose
   site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.

   When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the
   letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwen's
   early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter
   vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from
   former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and
   clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there
   a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born
   in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of
   February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of
   fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the
   speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem
   proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most
   of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the
   strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and
   Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much
   local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours
   of fires on the hills at night.

   Curwen's only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of
   Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often
   seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no
   means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it
   was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard
   there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights
   seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he
   displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was
   considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the
   witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph
   Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned
   of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly
   old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty
   years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim
   his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon
   Orne's known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till
   1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas
   Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.

   Certain documents by and about all of the strange characters were
   available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of
   Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and
   bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There
   were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial
   records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court
   of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that: 'fortie Witches and the
   Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinson's
   house', and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge
   Gedney that:'Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye
   Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W.,
   Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.'

   Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinson's uncanny library as found after
   his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting,
   couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this
   manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it
   was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher
   became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his
   speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He
   never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.

   But of greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward
   only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had
   already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen;
   namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person.
   As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long
   in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not
   return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation.
   Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence,
   but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters
   and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and
   diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or
   had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography
   that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as
   positively Joseph Curwen's.

   This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the
   one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from
   internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be
   amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose
   history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as "Simon",
   but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run
   through the word.

                                                           Providence, 1. May

     To Mr. Simon Orne,
     William's-Lane, in Salem.

   This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of
   Curwen's Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that
   time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because
   it indicated as the newer Curwen house, built in 1761 on the site of the
   old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known
   to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers' Hill. The place was
   indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hill's higher
   ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for
   occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find,
   in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar
   rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward;
   and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more
   mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind
   of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of
   curiousity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14,14 - was the
   familiar verse, 'If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my
   appointed time will I wait, until my change come.'

                                       2

   Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the
   following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney
   Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but
   was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar
   Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney,
   and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment,
   and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration
   externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the
   sinister matters of his quest.

   The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very
   courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah.
   Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with
   regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and
   shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst most of the fine
   wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or
   covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did
   not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least
   exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man
   of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been
   very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.

   From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the
   photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local
   Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he
   obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was
   ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old
   letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very
   fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible
   description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot
   letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the
   Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly,
   since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked
   like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court
   to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath
   peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.

   Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the
   walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the
   library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large
   panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after
   about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious
   ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the
   peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary
   interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more
   careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil
   portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not
   risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture
   with the knife might have been, but just retired from the scene of his
   discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist
   of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of
   College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at
   once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife
   were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly
   reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.

   As day by the day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked
   on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after
   their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the
   picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some
   time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man
   with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and
   white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a
   window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was
   observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm,
   undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the
   artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client
   begin to grasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid
   visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which
   heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final
   stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which
   centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward,
   dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of
   his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.

   Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his
   father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on
   stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of
   rather great age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some
   trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise
   duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Ward's resemblance to her
   ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had
   some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone
   Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had
   better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she
   averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in
   its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of
   power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at
   Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine
   scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son,
   and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is
   needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr.
   Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with
   a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing
   the picture at a curtly fixed price which cut short the impending torrent
   of unctuous haggling.

   It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home,
   where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation
   with an electric mock-fireplace in Charles's third-floor study or library.
   To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the
   twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker
   decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and
   portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision
   for transportation in the company's motor truck. There was left a space of
   exposed brickwork marking the chimney's course, and in this young Ward
   observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain
   directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space
   might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding
   beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a
   crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have
   formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the
   dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription
   on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the
   Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the 'Journall and Notes of
   Jos: Curwen, Gent. of Prouidence-Plantations, Late of Salem.'

   Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two
   curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature
   and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help
   establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major
   eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwen's
   handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its
   inscription: 'To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time &
   Ye Spheres.'

   Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher
   which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced,
   seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were
   addressed respectively to:'Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger' and Jedediah Orne,
   esq.', 'or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Represent'g Them.' The sixth and
   last was inscribed: 'Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Bet'n ye yeares
   1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyag'd, Where He Stay'd, Whom He Sawe, and
   What He Learnt.'

                                       3

   We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of
   alienists date Charles Ward's madness. Upon his discovery the youth had
   looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and
   manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him
   tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen, he appeared to
   guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a
   perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance
   of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news
   with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its
   supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did
   not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had
   found some documents in Joseph Curwen's handwriting, 'mostly in cipher',
   which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their
   true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the
   workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiousity. As it was he
   doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would
   increase their discussion of the matter.

   That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and
   papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent
   request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him;
   and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install
   the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept
   in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the
   unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that
   he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he
   had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that
   the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his
   work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation
   of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log,
   setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall
   as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match
   the room's. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to
   allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work
   into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and
   half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and
   century-recalling mirror.

   His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give
   interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practised.
   Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might by studying, since
   he rightly assumed that Curwen's intricate and archaic chirography would
   be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect;
   and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of
   cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled 'To Him Who Shal
   Come After, etc.' seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient
   paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under
   lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them
   whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and
   habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to
   cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a
   great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to
   bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to
   make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the
   humanities than any university which the world could boast.

   Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric,
   and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without
   attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a
   hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close
   confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and
   mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his
   treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had
   deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait
   until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed
   without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and
   his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mother's case by her
   manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.

   During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for
   the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism
   and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources
   proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of
   the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the
   Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical
   subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole
   additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny
   subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of
   out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the
   Essex Institute.

   About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Ward's bearing an element
   of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon
   the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical
   research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the
   unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of
   vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific
   supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless
   catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at
   the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the
   definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and
   feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older
   generation had so wisely blotted the name.

   Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that
   something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests
   before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was
   unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he
   failed in no test, it could be seen that the older application had all
   vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new
   laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found
   either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of
   occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied
   increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him
   from the great overmantel on the North wall.

   Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of
   rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause
   appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had
   probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the
   grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was
   explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the
   investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwen's burial which
   had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious
   leaden coffin had been interred '10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali
   Field's grave in y-.' The lack of a specified burying-ground in the
   surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Field's
   grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic
   effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on
   the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from
   which St. John's (the former King's) Churchyard and the ancient
   Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were
   excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field
   (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.

                                       4

   It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and
   fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from
   Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The
   interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every
   moment that Charles was thorough master of himself and in touch with
   matters of real importance; but it at least force the secretive youth to
   offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid,
   impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready
   to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that
   the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early
   scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope
   comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing
   even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a
   body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation
   to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all
   impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the
   history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar
   with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of
   correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as
   fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of
   the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to made a full
   announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the
   world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly
   revolutionise the current conception of things.

   As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the
   details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to
   think that Joseph Curwen's mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols
   - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who
   had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final
   solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wish to guard his
   secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an
   exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic
   documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with
   such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne
   formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the
   real Curwen finds - the 'Journall and Notes', the cipher (title in cipher
   also), and the formula-filled message 'To Him Who Shal Come After' - and
   let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.

   He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its
   innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwen's connected handwriting
   in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated
   letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round
   both penmanship and style despite the writer's survival into the
   eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was
   genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only
   a fragment:

     'Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London
     with XX newe Men pick'd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2
     Dutch Men from Surinam. Ye Dutch Men are like to Desert from have'g
     hearde Somewhat ill of these Ventures, but I will see to ye Inducing of
     them to Staye. For Mr. Knight Dexter of ye Bay and Book 120 Pieces

     Pieces Shalloons, 50 Pieces Calamancoes, 300 Pieces each, Shendsoy and
     Humhums. For Mr. Green at ye Elephant 50 Gallon Cyttles, 20 Warm'g

     not give me the Use of What he hath so well us'd these hundred Yeares.
     Simon hath not writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hear'g from
     Him.'

   When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly
   checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the
   doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of
   sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenacious in his memory.
   They ran: 'Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus be'g spoke V Roodmasses and IV
   Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breed'g Outside ye Spheres. It will
   drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal Bee, and he shal
   think on Past Thinges and look back thro' all ye Yeares, against ye Which
   I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make 'em with.'

   Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague
   terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down
   from the overmantel. Even after that he entertained the odd fancy - which
   his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes
   of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow
   young Charles Ward as he move about the room. He stopped before leaving to
   study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and
   memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even
   down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo
   Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced
   Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.

   Assured by the doctor that Charles's mental health was in no danger, but
   that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of
   real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise
   have been when during the following June the youth made positive his
   refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital
   importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year
   in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in
   America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a
   boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a
   none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for
   Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard
   searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more
   completely from the sight of his family's friends than he had been before;
   keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other
   cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk to a strange
   mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper hand printed a
   curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence
   reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his
   parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.

   Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small
   competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take
   the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would
   say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many
   places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When
   they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped
   as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool
   with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him
   to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in
   Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing
   good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay,
   shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the
   British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote by
   little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all
   his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of
   his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous
   old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its
   tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas
   alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index
   of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.

   In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he
   had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliotheque
   Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving
   an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among
   rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He
   avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen
   him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card
   from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient
   town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed
   to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval
   information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move
   till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna
   telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly
   region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the
   occult had invited him.

   The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Ward's
   progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy,
   whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed
   at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week
   later, saying that his host's carriage had met him and that he was leaving
   the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable
   time; indeed, he did reply to his parents' frequent letters until May,
   when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in
   London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were
   planning to travel to Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he
   could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron
   Ferenczy's castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark
   wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that
   normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was
   not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England
   gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so
   great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his
   parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be
   far distant.

   That return did not, however, take place until May 1926, when after a few
   heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the
   Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly
   drinking in the green rolling hills, and fragrant, blossoming orchards,
   and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of
   ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the
   Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late
   spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to
   Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood Avenues was a breathless and
   wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had
   delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets
   join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant,
   remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head
   swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down to the terminal behind the
   Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced
   greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire
   of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening against the
   fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.

   Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long,
   continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn
   him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix.
   Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case may be, for which
   all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab
   whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the
   old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope
   of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and
   sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned
   northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes
   had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful
   feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on
   the left the classic Adam porch and stately facade of the great brick
   house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come
   home.

                                       5

   A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lyman's assign to
   Ward's European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he
   was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning
   implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to
   concede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queerness of the
   youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned
   abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental
   aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly
   aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in
   several talks with Dr. Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even
   an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the
   notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from
   Ward's attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There
   were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny
   rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Ward's own voice, there
   was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the
   formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every
   hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of
   the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of
   the tones were heard.

   The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise
   exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they
   were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the
   power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency
   to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or
   endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite
   distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself
   diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally
   strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had
   greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great
   revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a
   startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library;
   and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling
   at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the
   picture's right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard
   from the living youth. These calls of Willett's, undertaken at the request
   of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the
   doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young man's inner
   psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images
   of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants
   of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared
   central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and
   incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or
   suppress furtive talk of Charles's madness.

   In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight,
   as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly
   through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the
   bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the
   neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces
   of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the
   prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought
   with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been
   struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles
   met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an
   almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He
   assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm
   would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he
   was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off,
   whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water.
   The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away.
   Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Ward's face
   crystallised into a very singular expression.

   For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than
   usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather,
   and made odd inquires about the date of the spring thawing of the ground.
   One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not
   return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a
   rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be
   distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four
   dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charles's
   direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured
   breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull
   thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the
   four reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.

   The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the
   dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some
   metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused
   all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible
   cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son
   at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The
   hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless
   and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he
   would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of
   some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did
   finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone
   to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the
   beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other
   person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the
   adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to
   his inviolable private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with
   books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the
   Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.

   In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and
   damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett,
   having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household,
   looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the
   destroyed section the following small item had occurred:

               Nocturnal Diggers Surprised in North Burial Ground

     Robert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning
     discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part
     of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had
     accomplished whatever their object may have been.

     The discovery took place at about four o'clock, when Hart's attention
     was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter.
     Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away;
     but could not reach it before the noise of his feet on the gravel had
     revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck
     and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and
     since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an
     object which they wished to bury.

     The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection,
     for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from
     the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have
     long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave,
     was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the
     cemetery records.

     Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion
     that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously
     seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed.
     In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed
     up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.

   During the next few days Charles Ward was seldom seen by his family.
   Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to
   himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in
   until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae
   and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other
   times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass,
   hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the
   most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times
   around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse
   whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest
   speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he
   required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure
   volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole
   situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly
   at a loss what to do or think about it.

                                       6

   Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While
   nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very
   terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great
   significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of
   which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as
   an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began
   repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time
   burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire
   house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked
   door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and
   listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr.
   Willett's request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett
   that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of
   "Eliphas Levi", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the
   forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:

     'Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,
     Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,
     verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,
     conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,
     daemonia Coeli God, Almonsin, Gibor, Jehosua,
     Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.'

   This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when
   over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The
   extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the
   papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was
   overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous,
   all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever
   smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very
   perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding
   and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice
   that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its
   incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Ward's voice.
   It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above
   the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair
   outside her son's locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its
   hellish imports; for Charles had told of its evil fame in dark books, and
   of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letter,
   above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwen's
   annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles
   had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of
   his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic
   and forgotten language: 'DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA
   ENITEMAUS.'

   Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the
   daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of
   added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable.
   Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that
   sounded like 'Yi nash Yog Sothoth he lgeb throdag' - ending in a 'Yah!'
   whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later
   all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out
   with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of
   diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and
   blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the
   concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again,
   but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in
   the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still
   bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted,
   although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause.
   Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.

   Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and
   not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that
   she was probably watching at Charles's door, from which the sounds had
   been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw
   Mrs. Ward stretched out at full length on the floor of the corridor
   outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to
   fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing
   the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate
   response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes
   when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very
   state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was
   not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense,
   muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality
   profoundly disturbing to the soul.

   It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this
   muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or
   imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections
   suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was
   undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness
   which the youth's best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely
   approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal
   about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his
   mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore
   Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast
   that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and
   bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had
   so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to
   escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously
   with his burden. For Mrs. Ward's cry had evidently been heard by others
   than he, and there had come in response to it from behind the locked door
   the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy
   had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charles's own voice,
   but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who
   overheard them. The phrase was just this: 'Sshh!-write!'

   Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former
   resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No
   matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be
   permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity
   and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire
   household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses,
   since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and
   imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had
   brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill
   and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.

   Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charles's
   laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he
   heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were
   apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping
   to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast
   armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charles's aspect was
   very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the
   sound of his father's voice. At the elder man's command he sat down, and
   for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There
   was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was
   right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours
   were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of great quiet,
   though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his
   future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could
   obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary
   at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed
   the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard
   was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental
   atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr.
   Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise
   despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was
   really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left
   the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was
   as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been
   found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted
   mouth.

   Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced
   curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the
   attic. The youth's library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one
   might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had
   been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that
   nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously
   removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items;
   histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature,
   philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It
   was a very curious shift from Charles Ward's recent run of reading, and
   the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense
   of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost
   clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him.
   Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever
   since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and
   at last it dawned upon him what it was.

   On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house
   in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the
   large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done
   their work at last, and at some time since the room's last cleaning the
   worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and
   tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been
   malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned
   forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled,
   and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine blue-grey
   dust.

                          IV. A Mutation and a Madness

                                       1

   In the week following that memorable Good Friday Charles Ward was seen
   more often than usual, and was continually carrying books between his
   library and the attic laboratory. His actions were quiet and rational, but
   he had a furtive, hunted look which his mother did not like, and developed
   an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook.
   Dr. Willett had been told of those Friday noises and happenings, and on
   the following Tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the
   library where the picture stared no more. The interview was, as always,
   inconclusive; but Willett is still ready to swear that the youth was sane
   and himself at the time. He held out promises of an early revelation, and
   spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere. At the loss of the
   portrait he grieved singularly little considering his first enthusiasm
   over it, but seemed to find something of positive humour in its sudden
   crumbling.

   About the second week Charles began to be absent from the house for long
   periods, and one day when good old black Hannah came to help with the
   spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house in
   Olney Court, where he would come with a large valise and perform curious
   delvings in the cellar. He was always very liberal to her and to old Asa,
   but seemed more worried than he used to be; which grieved her very much,
   since she had watched him grow up from birth. Another report of his doings
   came from Pawtuxet, where some friends of the family saw him at a distance
   a surprising number of times. He seemed to haunt the resort and
   canoe-house of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet, and subsequent inquiries by Dr.
   Willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to
   secure access to the rather hedged-in river-bank, along which he would
   walk toward the north, usually not reappearing for a very long while.

   Late in May came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic
   laboratory which brought a stern reproof from Mr. Ward and a somewhat
   distracted promise of amendment from Charles. It occurred one morning, and
   seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation noted on that
   turbulent Good Friday. The youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with
   himself, for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series
   of clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and
   denials which caused Mrs. Ward to run upstairs and listen at the door. She
   could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain words were 'must have
   it red for three months', and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once.
   When Charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were
   certain conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could
   avoid, but which he would try to transfer to other realms.

   About the middle of June a queer nocturnal incident occurred. In the early
   evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs,
   and Mr. Ward was on the point of investigating when it suddenly quieted
   down. That midnight, after the family had retired, the butler was
   nightlocking the front door when according to his statement Charles
   appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs
   with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress. The youth
   spoke no word, but the worthy Yorkshireman caught one sight of his fevered
   eyes and trembled causelessly. He opened the door and young Ward went out,
   but in the morning he presented his resignation to Mrs. Ward. There was,
   he said, something unholy in the glance Charles had fixed on him. It was
   no way for a young gentleman to look at an honest person, and he could not
   possibly stay another night. Mrs. Ward allowed the man to depart, but she
   did not value his statement highly. To fancy Charles in a savage state
   that night was quite ridiculous, for as long as she had remained awake she
   had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above; sounds as if of sobbing
   and pacing, and of a sighing which told only of despair's profoundest
   depths. Mrs. Ward had grown used to listening for sounds in the night, for
   the mystery of her son was fast driving all else from her mind.

   The next evening, much as on another evening nearly three months before,
   Charles Ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the
   main section. This matter was not recalled till later, when Dr. Willett
   began checking up loose ends and searching out missing links here and
   there. In the Journal office he found the section which Charles had lost,
   and marked two items as of possible significance. They were as follows:

                             More Cemetery Delving

     It was this morning discovered by Robert Hart, night watchman at the
     North Burial Ground, that ghouls were again at work in the ancient
     portion of the cemetery. The grave of Ezra Weeden, who was born in 1740
     and died in 1824 according to his uprooted and savagely splintered slate
     headstone, was found excavated and rifled, the work being evidently done
     with a spade stolen from an adjacent tool-shed.

     Whatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial,
     all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood. There were no wheel
     tracks, but the police have measured a single set of footprints which
     they found in the vicinity, and which indicate the boots of a man of
     refinement.

     Hart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last
     March, when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a
     deep excavation; but Sergt. Riley of the Second Station discounts this
     theory and points to vital differences in the two cases. In March the
     digging had been in a spot where no grave was known; but this time a
     well-marked and cared-for grave had been rifled with every evidence of
     deliberate purpose, and with a conscious malignity expressed in the
     splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day before.

     Members of the Weeden family, notified of the happening, expressed their
     astonishment and regret; and were wholly unable to think of any enemy
     who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor. Hazard Weeden of
     598 Angell Street recalls a family legend according to which Ezra Weeden
     was involved in some very peculiar circumstances, not dishonourable to
     himself, shortly before the Revolution; but of any modern feud or
     mystery he is frankly ignorant. Inspector Cunningham has been assigned
     to the case, and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near
     future.

                             Dogs Noisy in Pawtuxet

     Residents of Pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a.m. today by a phenomenal
     baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of
     Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling were
     unusually odd, according to most who heard it; and Fred Lemdin, night
     watchman at Rhodes, declares it was mixed with something very like the
     shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony. A sharp and very brief
     thunderstorm, which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the
     river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and unpleasant odours,
     probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly linked with
     this incident; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs.

   The aspect of Charles now became very haggard and hunted, and all agreed
   in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some
   statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him. The morbid
   listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made
   frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness, and most of the more
   academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting
   cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this
   time, but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known
   perpetrator. These cases, too recent and celebrated to need detailed
   mention, involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster
   around two distinct localities; the residential hill and the North End,
   near the Ward home, and the suburban districts across the Cranston line
   near Pawtuxet. Both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were
   attacked, and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a
   lean, lithe, leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in
   the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenously.

   Dr. Willett, who refuses to date the madness of Charles Ward as far back
   as even this, is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors. He has,
   he declares, certain theories of his own; and limits his positive
   statements to a peculiar kind of negation: 'I will not,' he says, 'state
   who or what I believe perpetrated these attacks and murders, but I will
   declare that Charles Ward was innocent of them. I have reason to be sure
   he was ignorant of the taste of blood, as indeed his continued anaemic
   decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal argument. Ward
   meddled with terrible things, but he has paid for it, and he was never a
   monster or a villain. As for now - I don't like to think. A change came,
   and I'm content to believe that the old Charles Ward died with it. His
   soul did, anyhow, for that mad flesh that vanished from Waite's hospital
   had another.'

   Willett speaks with authority, for he was often at the Ward home attending
   Mrs. Ward, whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain. Her nocturnal
   listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the
   doctor with hesitancy, and which he ridiculed in talking to her, although
   they made him ponder deeply when alone. These delusions always concerning
   the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and
   bedroom, and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at
   the most impossible times. Early in July Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to
   Atlantic City for an indefinite recuperative sojourn, and cautioned both
   Mr. Ward and the haggard and elusive Charles to write her only cheering
   letters. It is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she
   owes her life and continued sanity.

                                       2

   Not long after his mother's departure, Charles Ward began negotiating for
   the Pawtuxet bungalow. It was a squalid little wooden edifice with a
   concrete garage, perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river
   slightly above Rhodes, but for some odd reason the youth would have
   nothing else. He gave the real-estate agencies no peace till one of them
   secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner,
   and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under cover of darkness,
   transporting in a great closed van the entire contents of his attic
   laboratory, including the books both weird and modern which he had
   borrowed from his study. He had this van loaded in the black small hours,
   and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and
   stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away. After that Charles
   moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor, and never haunted
   the attic again.

   To the Pawtuxet bungalow Charles transferred all the secrecy with which he
   had surrounded his attic realm, save that he now appeared to have two
   sharers of his mysteries; a villainous-looking Portuguese half-caste from
   the South Main St. waterfront who acted as a servant, and a thin,
   scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed
   aspect whose status was evidently that of a colleague. Neighbours vainly
   tried to engage these odd persons in conversation. The mulatto Gomes spoke
   very little English, and the bearded man, who gave his name as Dr. Allen,
   voluntarily followed his example. Ward himself tried to be more affable,
   but succeeded only in provoking curiousity with his rambling accounts of
   chemical research. Before long queer tales began to circulate regarding
   the all-night burning of lights; and somewhat later, after this burning
   had suddenly ceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate
   orders of meat from the butcher's and of the muffled shouting,
   declamation, rhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some
   very cellar below the place. Most distinctly the new and strange household
   was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it is
   not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated
   establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and
   murders; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined
   wholly to Pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of Edgewood.

   Ward spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at
   home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his father's roof. Twice he
   was absent from the city on week-long trips, whose destinations have not
   yet been discovered. He grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than
   before, and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to Dr.
   Willett his old, old story of vital research and future revelations.
   Willett often waylaid him at his father's house, for the elder Ward was
   deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to get as much sound
   oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent
   an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as
   this, and adduces many a conversation to prove his point.

   About September the vampirism declined, but in the following January
   almost became involved in serious trouble. For some time the nocturnal
   arrival and departure of motor trucks at the Pawtuxet bungalow had been
   commented upon, and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the
   nature of at least one item of their contents. In a lonely spot near Hope
   Valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylaying of trucks by
   "hi-jackers" in quest of liquor shipments, but this time the robbers had
   been destined to receive the greater shock. For the long cases they seized
   proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things; so
   gruesome, in fact, that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the
   denizens of the underworld. The thieves had hastily buried what they
   discovered, but when the State Police got wind of the matter a careful
   search was made. A recently arrived vagrant, under promise of immunity
   from prosecution on any additional charge, at last consented to guide a
   party of troopers to the spot; and there was found in that hasty cache a
   very hideous and shameful thing. It would not be well for the national -
   or even the international - sense of decorum if the public were ever to
   know what was uncovered by that awestruck party. There was no mistaking
   it, even by those far from studious officers; and telegrams to Washington
   ensued with feverish rapidity.

   The cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow, and
   State and Federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious
   call. They found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions, and
   received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of
   innocence. He had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a
   programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him
   in the last decade could prove, and had ordered the required kind and
   number from agencies which he had thought as reasonably legitimate as such
   things can be. Of the  identity of the specimens he had known absolutely
   nothing, and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at the
   monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a
   knowledge of the matter would produce. In this statement he was firmly
   sustained by his bearded colleague Dr. Allen, whose oddly hollow voice
   carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones; so that in the
   end the officials took no action, but carefully set down the New York name
   and address which Ward gave them a basis for a search which came to
   nothing. It is only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and
   quietly restored to their proper places, and that the general public will
   never know of their blasphemous disturbance.

   On February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward which
   he considers of extraordinary importance, and about which he has
   frequently quarrelled with Dr. Lyman. Lyman believes that this note
   contains positive proof of a well-developed case of dementia praecox, but
   Willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance
   of the hapless youth. He calls especial attention to the normal character
   of the penmanship; which though shewing traces of shattered nerves, is
   nevertheless distinctly Ward's own. The text in full is as follows:

                                                             100 Prospect St.
                                                            Providence, R.I.,
                                                            February 8, 1928.

     Dear Dr. Willett:-

     I feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures
     which I have so long promised you, and for which you have pressed me so
     often. The patience you have shewn in waiting, and the confidence you
     have shewn in my mind and integrity, are things I shall never cease to
     appreciate.

     And now that I am ready to speak, I must own with humiliation that no
     triumph such as I dreamed of can ever be mine. Instead of triumph I have
     found terror, and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a
     plea for help and advice in saving both myself and the world from a
     horror beyond all human conception or calculation. You recall what those
     Fenner letters said of the old raiding party at Pawtuxet. That must all
     be done again, and quickly. Upon us depends more than can be put into
     words - all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the
     solar system and the universe. I have brought to light a monstrous
     abnormality, but I did it for the sake of knowledge. Now for the sake of
     all life and Nature you must help me thrust it back into the dark again.

     I have left that Pawtuxet place forever, and we must extirpate
     everything existing there, alive or dead. I shall not go there again,
     and you must not believe it if you ever hear that I am there. I will
     tell you why I say this when I see you. I have come home for good, and
     wish you would call on me at the very first moment that you can spare
     five or six hours continuously to hear what I have to say. It will take
     that long - and believe me when I tell you that you never had a more
     genuine professional duty than this. My life and reason are the very
     least things which hang in the balance.

     I dare not tell my father, for he could not grasp the whole thing. But I
     have told him of my danger, and he has four men from a detective agency
     watching the house. I don't know how much good they can do, for they
     have against them forces which even you could scarcely envisage or
     acknowledge. So come quickly if you wish to see me alive and hear how
     you may help to save the cosmos from stark hell.

     Any time will do - I shall not be out of the house. Don't telephone
     ahead, for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you. And
     let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent this
     meeting.

                                           In utmost gravity and desperation,

                                                         Charles Dexter Ward.

     P.S. Shoot Dr. Allen on sight and dissolve his body in acid. Don't burn
     it.

   Dr. Willett received this note about 10:30 a.m., and immediately arranged
   to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk,
   letting it extend on into the night as long as might be necessary. He
   planned to arrive about four o'clock, and through all the intervening
   hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild speculation that most of his
   tasks were very mechanically performed. Maniacal as the letter would have
   sounded to a stranger, Willett had seen too much of Charles Ward's
   oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving. That something very subtle,
   ancient, and horrible was hovering about he felt quite sure, and the
   reference to Dr. Allen could almost be comprehended in view of what
   Pawtuxet gossip said of Ward's enigmatical colleague. Willett had never
   seen the man, but had heard much of his aspect and bearing, and could not
   but wonder what sort of eyes those much-discussed dark glasses might
   conceal.

   Promptly at four Dr. Willett presented himself at the Ward residence, but
   found to his annoyance that Charles had not adhered to his determination
   to remain indoors. The guards were there, but said that the young man
   seemed to have lost part of his timidity. He had that morning done much
   apparently frightened arguing and protesting over the telephone, one of
   the detectives said, replying to some unknown voice with phrases such as
   'I am very tired and must rest a while', 'I can't receive anyone for some
   time', 'you'll have to excuse me', 'Please postpone decisive action till
   we can arrange some sort of compromise', or 'I am very sorry, but I must
   take a complete vacation from everything; I'll talk with you later.' Then,
   apparently gaining boldness through meditation, he had slipped out so
   quietly that no one had seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he
   returned about one o'clock and entered the house without a word. He had
   gone upstairs, where a bit of his fear must have surged back; for he was
   heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library,
   afterward trailing off into a kind of choking gasp. When, however, the
   butler had gone to inquire what the trouble was, he had appeared at the
   door with a great show of boldness, and had silently gestured the man away
   in a manner that terrified him unaccountably. Then he had evidently done
   some rearranging of his shelves, for a great clattering and thumping and
   creaking ensued; after which he had reappeared and left at once. Willett
   inquired whether or not any message had been left, but was told that there
   was no none. The butler seemed queerly disturbed about something in
   Charles's appearance and manner, and asked solicitously if there was much
   hope for a cure of his disordered nerves.

   For almost two hours Dr. Willett waited vainly in Charles Ward's library,
   watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books had been
   removed, and smiling grimly at the panelled overmantel on the north wall,
   whence a year before the suave features of old Joseph Curwen had looked
   mildly down. After a time the shadows began to gather, and the sunset
   cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which flew shadow-like before
   the night. Mr. Ward finally arrived, and shewed much surprise and anger at
   his son's absence after all the pains which had been taken to guard him.
   He had not known of Charles's appointment, and promised to notify Willett
   when the youth returned. In bidding the doctor goodnight he expressed his
   utter perplexity at his son's condition, and urged his caller to do all he
   could to restore the boy to normal poise. Willett was glad to escape from
   that library, for something frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it; as if
   the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of evil. He had never liked
   that picture; and even now, strong-nerved though he was, there lurked a
   quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get out
   into the pure air as soon as possible.

                                       3

   The next morning Willett received a message from the senior Ward, saying
   that Charles was still absent. Mr. Ward mentioned that Dr. Allen had
   telephoned him to say that Charles would remain at Pawtuxet for some time,
   and that he must not be disturbed. This was necessary because Allen
   himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite period, leaving the
   researches in need of Charles's constant oversight. Charles sent his best
   wishes, and regretted any bother his abrupt change of plans might have
   caused. In listening to this message Mr. Ward heard Dr. Allen's voice for
   the first time, and it seemed to excite some vague and elusive memory
   which could not be actually placed, but which was disturbing to the point
   of fearfulness.

   Faced by these baffling and contradictory reports, Dr. Willett was frankly
   at a loss what to do. The frantic earnestness of Charles's note was not to
   be denied, yet what could one think of its writer's immediate violation of
   his own expressed policy? Young Ward had written that his delvings had
   become blasphemous and menacing, that they and his bearded colleague must
   be extirpated at any cost, and that he himself would never return to their
   final scene; yet according to latest advices he had forgotten all this and
   was back in the thick of the mystery. Common sense bade one leave the
   youth alone with his freakishness, yet some deeper instinct would not
   permit the impression of that frenzied letter to subside. Willett read it
   over again, and could not make its essence sound as empty and insane as
   both its bombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to
   imply. Its terror was too profound and real, and in conjunction with what
   the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from
   beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation. There were
   nameless horrors abroad; and no matter how little one might be able to get
   at them, one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any time.

   For over a week Dr. Willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust
   upon him, and became more and more inclined to pay Charles a call at the
   Pawtuxet bungalow. No friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this
   forbidden retreat, and even his father knew of its interior only from such
   descriptions as he chose to give; but Willett felt that some direct
   conversation with his patient was necessary. Mr. Ward had been receiving
   brief and non-committal typed notes from his son, and said that Mrs. Ward
   in her Atlantic City retirement had had no better word. So at length the
   doctor resolved to act; and despite a curious sensation inspired by old
   legends of Joseph Curwen, and by more recent revelations and warnings from
   Charles Ward, set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the
   river.

   Willett had visited the spot before through sheer curiousity, though of
   course never entering the house or proclaiming his presence; hence knew
   exactly the route to take. Driving out Broad Street one early afternoon
   toward the end of February in his small motor, he thought oddly of the
   grim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fifty-seven
   years before on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehend.

   The ride through the city's decaying fringe was short, and trim Edgewood
   and sleepy Pawtuxet presently spread out ahead. Willett turned to the
   right down Lockwood Street and drove his car as far along that rural road
   as he could, then alighted and walked north to where the bluff towered
   above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of misty downlands
   beyond. Houses were still few here, and there was no mistaking the
   isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high point of land at his
   left. Stepping briskly up the neglected gravel walk he rapped at the door
   with a firm hand, and spoke without a tremor to the evil Portuguese
   mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack.

   He must, he said, see Charles Ward at once on vitally important business.
   No excuse would be accepted, and a repulse would mean only a full report
   of the matter to the elder Ward. The mulatto still hesitated, and pushed
   against the door when Willett attempted to open it; but the doctor merely
   raised his voice and renewed his demands. Then there came from the dark
   interior a husky whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and
   through though he did not know why he feared it. 'Let him in, Tony,' it
   said, 'we may as well talk now as ever.' But disturbing as was the
   whisper, the greater fear was that which immediately followed. The floor
   creaked and the speaker hove in sight - and the owner of those strange and
   resonant tones was seen to be no other than Charles Dexter Ward.

   The minuteness with which Dr. Willett recalled and recorded his
   conversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this
   particular period. For at last he concedes a vital change in Charles
   Dexter Ward's mentality, and believes that the youth now spoke from a
   brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched for six
   and twenty years. Controversy with Dr. Lyman has compelled him to be very
   specific, and he definitely dates the madness of Charles Ward from the
   time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents. Those notes are not
   in Ward's normal style; not even in the style of that last frantic letter
   to Willett. Instead, they are strange and archaic, as if the snapping of
   the writer's mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions
   picked up unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism. There is an
   obvious effort to be modern, but the spirit and occasionally the language
   are those of the past.

   The past, too, was evident in Ward's every tone and gesture as he received
   the doctor in that shadowy bungalow. He bowed, motioned Willett to a seat,
   and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to
   explain at the very outset.

   'I am grown phthisical,' he began, 'from this cursed river air. You must
   excuse my speech. I suppose you are come from my father to see what ails
   me, and I hope you will say nothing to alarm him.'

   Willett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care, but studying
   even more closely the face of the speaker. Something, he felt, was wrong;
   and he thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that
   Yorkshire butler one night. He wished it were not so dark, but did not
   request that the blind be opened. Instead, he merely asked Ward why he had
   so belied the frantic note of little more than a week before.

   'I was coming to that,' the host replied. 'You must know, I am in a very
   bad state of nerves, and do and say queer things I cannot account for. As
   I have told you often, I am on the edge of great matters; and the bigness
   of them has a way of making me light-headed. Any man might well be
   frighted of what I have found, but I am not to be put off for long. I was
   a dunce to have that guard and stick at home; for having gone this far, my
   place is here. I am not well spoke of my prying neighbours, and perhaps I
   was led by weakness to believe myself what they say of me. There is no
   evil to any in what I do, so long as I do it rightly. Have the goodness to
   wait six months, and I'll shew you what will pay your patience well.'

   'You may as well know I have a way of learning old matters from things
   surer than books, and I'll leave you to judge the importance of what I can
   give to history, philosophy, and the arts by reason of the doors I have
   access to. My ancestor had all this when those witless peeping Toms came
   and murdered him. I now have it again, or am coming very imperfectly to
   have a part of it. This time nothing must happen, and least of all though
   any idiot fears of my own. Pray forget all I writ you, Sir, and have no
   fear of this place or any in it. Dr. Allen is a man of fine parts, and I
   own him an apology for anything ill I have said of him. I wish I had no
   need to spare him, but there were things he had to do elsewhere. His zeal
   is equal to mine in all those matters, and I suppose that when I feared
   the work I feared him too as my greatest helper in it.'

   Ward paused, and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think. He felt
   almost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter; and yet
   there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse was strange
   and alien and indubitably mad, the note itself had been tragic in its
   naturalness and likeness to the Charles Ward he knew. Willett now tried to
   turn the talk on early matters, and recall to the youth some past events
   which would restore a familiar mood; but in this process he obtained only
   the most grotesque results. It was the same with all the alienists later
   on. Important sections of Charles Ward's store of mental images, mainly
   those touching modern times and his own personal life, had been
   unaccountably expunged; whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his youth
   had welled up from some profound subconsciousness to engulf the
   contemporary and the individual. The youth's intimate knowledge of elder
   things was abnormal and unholy, and he tried his best to hide it. When
   Willett would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic
   studies he often shed by pure accident such a light as no normal mortal
   could conceivably be expected to possess, and the doctor shuddered as the
   glib allusion glided by.

   It was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriff's wig
   fell off as he leaned over at the play in Mr. Douglass's Histrionick
   Academy in King Street on the eleventh of February, 1762, which fell on a
   Thursday; or about how the actors cut the text of Steele's Conscious Lover
   so badly that one was almost glad the Baptist-ridden legislature closed
   the theatre a fortnight later. That Thomas Sabin's Boston coach was
   "damn'd uncomfortable" old letters may well have told; but what healthy
   antiquarian could recall how the creaking of Epenetus Olney's new
   signboard (the gaudy crown he set up after he took to calling his tavern
   the Crown Coffee House) was exactly like the first few notes of the new
   jazz piece all the radios in Pawtuxet were playing?

   Ward, however, would not be quizzed long in this vein. Modern and personal
   topics he waved aside quite summarily, whilst regarding antique affairs he
   soon shewed the plainest boredom. What he wished clearly enough was only
   to satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart without the intention of
   returning. To this end he offered to shew Willett the entire house, and at
   once proceeded to lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic.
   Willett looked sharply, but noted that the visible books were far too few
   and trivial to have ever filled the wide gaps on Ward's shelves at home,
   and that the meagre so-called "laboratory" was the flimsiest sort of a
   blind. Clearly, there were a library and a laboratory elsewhere; but just
   where, it was impossible to say. Essentially defeated in his quest for
   something he could not name, Willett returned to town before evening and
   told the senior Ward everything which had occurred. They agreed that the
   youth must be definitely out of his mind, but decided that nothing drastic
   need be done just then. Above all, Mrs. Ward must be kept in as complete
   an ignorance as her son's own strange typed notes would permit.

   Mr. Ward now determined to call in person upon his son, making it wholly a
   surprise visit. Dr. Willett took him in his car one evening, guiding him
   to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return. The
   session was a long one, and the father emerged in a very saddened and
   perplexed state. His reception had developed much like Willett's, save
   that Charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the
   visitor had forced his way into the hall and sent the Portuguese away with
   an imperative demand; and in the bearing of the altered son there was no
   trace of filial affection. The lights had been dim, yet even so the youth
   had complained that they dazzled him outrageously. He had not spoken out
   loud at all, averring that his throat was in very poor condition; but in
   his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that Mr. Ward
   could not banish it from his mind.

   Now definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youth's
   mental salvation, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett set about collecting every
   scrap of data which the case might afford. Pawtuxet gossip was the first
   item they studied, and this was relatively easy to glean since both had
   friends in that region. Dr. Willett obtained the most rumours because
   people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure,
   and from all he heard he could tell that young Ward's life had become
   indeed a strange one. Common tongues would not dissociate his household
   from the vampirism of the previous summer, while the nocturnal comings and
   goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculations.
   Local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the
   evil-looking mulatto, and in particular of the inordinate amounts of mean
   and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate
   neighbourhood. For a household of only three, these quantities were quite
   absurd.

   Then there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth. Reports of
   these things were harder to point down, but all the vague hints tallied in
   certain basic essentials. Noises of a ritual nature positively existed,
   and at times when the bungalow was dark. They might, of course, have come
   from the known cellar; but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more
   spreading crypts. Recalling the ancient tales of Joseph Curwen's
   catacombs, and assuming for granted that the present bungalow had been
   selected because of its situation on the old Curwen site as revealed in
   one of another of the documents found behind the picture, Willett and Mr.
   Ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention; and searched many times
   without success for the door in the river-bank which old manuscripts
   mentioned. As to popular opinions of the bungalow's various inhabitants,
   it was soon plain that the Brava Portuguese was loathed, the bearded and
   spectacled Dr. Allen feared, and the pallid young scholar disliked to a
   profound degree. During the last week or two Ward had obviously changed
   much, abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse
   but oddly repellent whispers on the few occasions that he ventured forth.

   Such were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there; and over these
   Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett held many long and serious conferences. They
   strove to exercise deduction, induction, and constructive imagination to
   their utmost extent; and to correlate every known fact of Charles's later
   life, including the frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father,
   with the meagre documentary evidence available concerning old Joseph
   Curwen. They would have given much for a glimpse of the papers Charles had
   found, for very clearly the key to the youth's madness lay in what he had
   learned of the ancient wizard and his doings.

                                       4

   And yet, after all, it was from no step of Mr. Ward's or Dr. Willett's
   that the next move in this singular case proceeded. The father and the
   physician, rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible
   to combat, had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of
   young Ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer. Then came the first of the
   month with its customary financial adjustments, and the clerks at certain
   banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the
   other. Officials who knew Charles Ward by sight went down to the bungalow
   to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture was a clumsy
   forgery, and were reassured less than they ought to have been when the
   youth hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by
   a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible. He could, he said,
   form no written characters at all except with great difficulty; and could
   prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent
   letters, even those to his father and mother, who would bear out the
   assertion.

   What made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance
   alone, for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious, nor
   even the Pawtuxet gossip, of which one or two of them had caught echoes.
   It was the muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them,
   implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important
   monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two
   before. Something was wrong; for despite the apparent coherence and
   rationality of his speech, there could be no normal reason for this
   ill-concealed blankness on vital points. Moreover, although none of these
   men knew Ward well, they could not help observing the change in his
   language and manner. They had heard he was an antiquarian, but even the
   most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete phraseology
   and gestures. Altogether, this combination of hoarseness, palsied hands,
   bad memory, and altered speech and bearing must represent some disturbance
   or malady of genuine gravity, which no doubt formed the basis of the
   prevailing odd rumours; and after their departure the party of officials
   decided that a talk with the senior Ward was imperative.

   So on the sixth of March, 1928, there was a long and serious conference in
   Mr. Ward's office, after which the utterly bewildered father summoned Dr.
   Willett in a kind of helpless resignation. Willett looked over the
   strained and awkward signatures of the cheque, and compared them in his
   mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note. Certainly, the change
   was radical and profound, and yet there was something damnably familiar
   about the new writing. It had crabbed and archaic tendencies of a very
   curious sort, and seemed to result from a type of stroke utterly different
   from that which the youth had always used. It was strange - but where had
   he seen it before? On the whole, it was obvious that Charles was insane.
   Of that there could be no doubt. And since it appeared unlikely that he
   could handle his property or continue to deal with the outside world much
   longer, something must quickly be done toward his oversight and possible
   cure. It was then that the alienists were called in, Drs. Peck and Waite
   of Providence and Dr. Lyman of Boston, to whom Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett
   gave the most exhaustive possible history of the case, and who conferred
   at length in the now unused library of their young patient, examining what
   books and papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of
   his habitual mental cast. After scanning this material and examining the
   ominous note to Willett they all agreed that Charles Ward's studies had
   been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary intellect, and
   wished most heartily that they could see his more intimate volumes and
   documents; but this latter they knew they could do, if at all, only after
   a scene at the bungalow itself. Willett now reviewed the whole case with
   febrile energy; it being at this time that he obtained the statements of
   the workmen who had seen Charles find the Curwen documents, and that he
   collated the incidents of the destroyed newspaper items, looking up the
   latter at the Journal office.

   On Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman, and Waite,
   accompanied by Mr. Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making no
   concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient
   with extreme minuteness. Charles, although he was inordinately long in
   answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious
   laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance, proved
   a far from recalcitrant subject; and admitted freely that his memory and
   balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies.
   He offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted
   upon; and seemed, indeed, to display a high degree of intelligence as
   apart from mere memory. His conduct would have sent his interviewers away
   in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and
   unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness
   marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal. Of his work he
   would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his
   family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous month he
   dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that this shadowy
   bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones, and
   waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as
   now saturated all his clothing. Neighbourhood gossip he attributed to
   nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiousity. Of the
   whereabouts of Dr. Allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak
   definitely, but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled
   man would return when needed. In paying off the stolid Brava who resisted
   all questioning by the visitors, and in closing the bungalow which still
   seemed to hold such nighted secrets, Ward shewed no signs of nervousness
   save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something
   very faint. He was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic
   resignation, as if he removal were the merest transient incident which
   would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for
   all. It was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of
   absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his
   twisted memory, his lost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and
   eccentric behaviour had led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be
   told of the change; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was
   taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital
   maintained by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to
   the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with
   the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed; the
   slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and the disproportionate neural
   reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners,
   for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible
   keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation. Even the familiar
   olive mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a great black mole
   or cicatrice which had never been there before, and which made Willett
   wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the witch markings
   reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild
   and lonely places. The doctor could not keep his mind off a certain
   transcribed witch-trial record from Salem which Charles had shewn him in
   the old non-secretive days, and which read: 'Mr. G. B. on that Nighte putt
   ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance
   W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.' Ward's face, too,
   troubled him horribly, till at length he suddenly discovered why he was
   horrified. For above the young man's right eye was something which he had
   never previously noticed - a small scar or pit precisely like that in the
   crumbled painting of old Joseph Curwen, and perhaps attesting some hideous
   ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of
   their occult careers.

   While Ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very
   strict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to Dr. Allen,
   which Mr. Ward had ordered delivered at the family home. Willett had
   predicted that very little would be found, since any communications of a
   vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger; but in the
   latter part of March there did come a letter from Prague for Dr. Allen
   which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought. It was in a very
   crabbed and archaic hand; and though clearly not the effort of a
   foreigner, shewed almost as singular a departure from modern English as
   the speech of young Ward himself. It read:

                                                             Kleinstrasse 11,
                                                            Altstadt, Prague,
                                                             11th Feby. 1928.

     To Mr. J. C. in
     Providence.

   Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent bit of
   unrelieved insanity. Only by degrees did they absorb what it seemed to
   imply. So the absent Dr. Allen, and not Charles Ward, had come to be the
   leading spirit at Pawtuxet? That must explain the wild reference and
   denunciation in the youth's last frantic letter. And what of this
   addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as "Mr. J. C."? There
   was no escaping the inference, but there are limits to possible
   monstrosity. Who was "Simon O."; the old man Ward had visited in Prague
   four years previously? Perhaps, but in the centuries behind there had been
   another Simon O. - Simon Orne, alias Jedediah, of Salem, who vanished in
   1771, and whose peculiar handwriting Dr. Willett now unmistakably
   recognised from the photostatic copies of the Orne formulae which Charles
   had once shown him. What horrors and mysteries, what contradictions and
   contraventions of Nature, had come back after a century and a half to
   harass Old Providence with her clustered spires and domes?

   The father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or think,
   went to see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as
   they could about Dr. Allen, about the Prague visit, and about what he had
   learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all these enquiries the
   youth was politely non-committal, merely barking in his hoarse whisper
   that he had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with
   certain souls from the past, and that any correspondent the bearded man
   might have in Prague would probably be similarly gifted. When they left,
   Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realised to their chagrin that they had really
   been the ones under catechism; and that without imparting anything vital
   himself, the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the
   Prague letter had contained.

   Drs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to
   the strange correspondence of young Ward's companion; for they knew the
   tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together, and
   believed that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an expatriated
   counterpart - perhaps one who had seen Orne's handwriting and copied it in
   an attempt to pose as the bygone character's reincarnation. Allen himself
   was perhaps a similar case, and may have persuaded the youth into
   accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead Curwen. Such things had been
   known before, and on the same basis the hard-headed doctors disposed of
   Willett's growing disquiet about Charles Ward's present handwriting, as
   studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses. Willett
   thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last, and that what it
   vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself;
   but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to
   be expected in a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any
   importance either favourable or unfavourable. Recognising this prosaic
   attitude in his colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself
   the letter which arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rakus,
   Transylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of
   the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before
   breaking the seal. This read as follows:

     Castle Ferenczy
     7 March 1928.

     Dear C.:-

     Hadd a Squad of 20 Militia up to talk about what the Country Folk say.
     Must digg deeper and have less Hearde. These Roumanians plague me
     damnably, being officious and particular where you cou'd buy a Magyar
     off with a Drinke and Food.

     Last monthe M. got me ye Sarcophagus of ye Five Sphinxes from ye
     Acropolis where He whome I call'd up say'd it wou'd be, and I have hadde
     3 Talkes with What was therein inhum'd. It will go to S. O. in Prague
     directly, and thence to you. It is stubborn but you know ye Way with
     Such.

     You shew Wisdom in having lesse about than Before; for there was no
     Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eat'g off their Heads, and it made
     Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe. You can
     now move and worke elsewhere with no Kill'g Trouble if needful, tho' I
     hope no Thing will soon force you to so Bothersome a Course.

     I rejoice that you traffick not so much with Those Outside; for there
     was ever a Mortall Peril in it, and you are sensible what it did when
     you ask'd Protection of One not dispos'd to give it.

     You excel me in gett'g ye Formulae so another may saye them with
     Success, but Borellus fancy'd it wou'd be so if just ye right Wordes
     were hadd. Does ye Boy use 'em often? I regret that he growes squeamish,
     as I fear'd he wou'd when I hadde him here nigh 15 Monthes, but am
     sensible you knowe how to deal with him. You can't saye him down with ye
     Formula, for that will Worke only upon such as ye other Formula hath
     call'd up from Saltes; but you still have strong Handes and Knife and
     Pistol, and Graves are not harde to digg, nor Acids loth to burne.

     O. sayes you have promis'd him B. F. I must have him after. B. goes to
     you soone, and may he give you what you wishe of that Darke Thing belowe
     Memphis. Imploy care in what you calle up, and beware of ye Boy.

     It will be ripe in a yeare's time to have up ye Legions from Underneath,
     and then there are no Boundes to what shal be oures. Have Confidence in
     what I saye, for you knowe O. and I have hadd these 150 yeares more than
     you to consulte these Matters in.

                                                      Nephreu - Ka nai Hadoth
                                                                      Edw. H.

     For J Curwen, Esq.
     Providence.

   But if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to the
   alienists, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount
   of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded
   and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charles's frantic letter had spoken as
   such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister correspondence with two
   inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited in his travels and who
   plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of Curwen's old Salem
   colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of Joseph
   Curwen, and that he entertained - or was at least advised to entertain -
   murderous designs against a "boy" who could scarcely be other than Charles
   Ward. There was organised horror afoot; and no matter who had started it,
   the missing Allen was by this time at the bottom of it. Therefore,
   thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost
   no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic,
   bearded doctor; finding whence he had come and what Pawtuxet knew of him,
   and if possible discovering his present whereabouts. Supplying the men
   with one of the bungalow keys which Charles yielded up, he urged them to
   explore Allen's vacant room which had been identified when the patient's
   belongings had been packed; obtaining what clues they could from any
   effects he might have left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in
   his son's old library, and they felt a marked relief when they left it at
   last; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil.
   Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose
   picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel, and perhaps it was
   something different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half sensed
   an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older
   dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material
   emanation.

                         V. A Nightmare and a Cataclysm

                                       1

   And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its
   indelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has
   added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far
   behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to
   an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists
   would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement alive in the
   world, whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the Salem
   witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least two living men - and one
   other of whom they dared not think - were in absolute possession of minds
   or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was
   likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural
   laws. What these horrible creatures - and Charles Ward as well - were
   doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from
   every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case.
   They were robbing the tombs of all the ages, including those of the
   world's wisest and greatest men, in the hope of recovering from the bygone
   ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated
   and informed them.

   A hideous traffic was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby
   illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of
   schoolboys swapping books; and from what was extorted from this centuried
   dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the
   cosmos had ever seen concentred in one man or group. They had found unholy
   ways to keep their brains alive, either in the same body or different
   bodies; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of
   the dead whom they gathered together. There had, it seems, been some truth
   in chimerical old Borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most
   antique remains certain "Essential Saltes" from which the shade of a
   long-dead living thing might be raised up. There was a formula for evoking
   such a shade, and another for putting it down; and it had now been so
   perfected that it could be taught successfully. One must be careful about
   evocations, for the markers of old graves are not always accurate.

   Willett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to
   conclusion. Things - presences or voices of some sort - could be drawn
   down from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process
   also one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many
   forbidden things, and as for Charles - what might one think of him? What
   forces "outside the spheres" had reached him from Joseph Curwen's day and
   turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find certain
   directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man of horror in
   Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of Transylvania.
   And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at last. That newspaper
   item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to
   overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must have come. That
   mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked
   attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and hollowness?
   Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr.
   Allen with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with
   vague horror in his single talk with the man - if man it were - over the
   telephone!

   What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had
   come to answer Charles Ward's secret rites behind that locked door? Those
   voices heard in argument - "must have it red for three months" - Good God!
   Was not that just before the vampirism broke out? The rifling of Ezra
   Weeden's ancient grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet - whose mind had
   planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder
   blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the
   gossip, and the fear. The final madness of Charles neither father nor
   doctor could attempt to explain, but they did feel sure that the mind of
   Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient
   morbidities. Was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility? Allen had
   something to do with it, and the detectives must find out more about one
   whose existence menaced the young man's life. In the meantime, since the
   existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond
   dispute, some effort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward,
   conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during
   their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of
   unparalleled thoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the
   following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories
   suited to architectural search and underground exploration.

   The morning of April 6th dawned clear, and both explorers were at the
   bungalow by ten o'clock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory
   survey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allen's room it was
   obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later searchers
   hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value. Of course
   the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without
   much delay, again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in
   the presence of the mad young owner. For a time everything seemed
   baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid
   and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yearning aperture was
   scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the original
   cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the beginning
   of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young Ward
   and his associates, where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose
   rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means.

   The doctor tried to put himself in Charles's place to see how a delver
   would be likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this
   method. Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully
   over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal, trying
   to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed
   down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the
   washtubs, which he tried once before in vain. Now experimenting in every
   possible way, and exerting a double strength, he finally found that the
   top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot. Beneath it
   lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to which Mr. Ward at
   once rushed with excited zeal. The cover was not hard to lift, and the
   father had quite removed it when Willett noticed the queerness of his
   aspect. He was swaying and nodding dizzily, and in the gust of noxious air
   which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample
   cause.

   In a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and
   was reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it could
   be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely
   sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out to Broad
   Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his
   weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric torch, covered
   his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze, and descended once more to peer
   into the new-found depths. The foul air had now slightly abated, and
   Willett was able to send a beam of light down the Stygian hold. For about
   ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and
   an iron ladder; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old
   stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest
   of the present building.

                                       2

   Willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen
   legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf. He
   could not help thinking of what Luke Fenner had reported on that last
   monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge,
   carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of
   supreme importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years, he descended the
   ladder and reached the slimy steps below. This was ancient masonry, his
   torch told him; and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of
   centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not spirally, but in three abrupt
   turns; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with
   difficulty. He had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very
   faintly; and after that he did not feel disposed to count any more.

   It was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages of
   Nature which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a doom-dragged
   whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without
   mind would be to miss its quintessential loathsomeness and soul-sickening
   overtones. Was it for this that Ward had seemed to listen on that day he
   was removed? It was the most shocking thing that Willett had ever heard,
   and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the
   bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls
   surmounted by Cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways.
   The hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high in the middle of
   the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large
   chipped flagstone, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its
   length he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the
   blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-panelled
   colonial type, whilst others had none.

   Overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began
   to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with
   groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently of bizarre
   used. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of whose chimneys
   would have formed an interesting study in engineering. Never before or
   since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here
   loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century
   and a half, in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient
   raiders. For many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet,
   and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph
   Curwen's experimentation. Finally there came a room of obvious modernity,
   or at least of recent occupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and
   tables, chairs and cabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying
   antiquity and contemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about
   in several places; and finding a match-safe handy, Willett lighted such as
   were ready for use.

   In the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than
   the latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the doctor had
   seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from
   the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to
   Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot
   the noisomness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they
   had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead,
   was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance;
   especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind
   the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a
   task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with
   papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or
   even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he
   found three large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and
   in writing clearly recognisable as Orne's and Hutchinson's; all of which
   he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.

   At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett
   found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant
   glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently
   kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them,
   since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the
   papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key.
   Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination
   of the files. Since young Ward's immediate condition was the greatest
   matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously
   recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very
   baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charles's
   normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months
   before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and
   formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed
   penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen,
   though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day
   programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard's writing, which
   Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any
   third hand which might have been Allen's there was not a trace. If he had
   indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his
   amanuensis.

   In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae,
   recurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished
   his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one
   surmounted by the archaic symbol called "Dragon's Head" and used in
   almanacs to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by
   a corresponding sign of "Dragon's Tail" or descending node. The appearance
   of the whole was something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor
   realised that the second half was no more than the first written
   syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of
   the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various
   spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible
   matter. The formulae were as follows - exactly so, as Willett is
   abundantly able to testify - and the first one struck an odd note of
   uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when
   reviewing the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year.

                         Y'AI 'NG'NGAH,  OGTHROD AI'F   
                          YOG-SOTHOTH     GEB'L-EE'H    
                           H'EE-L'GEB     YOG-SOTHOTH   
                          F'AI THRODOG   'NGAH'NG AI'Y  
                             UAAAH           ZHRO       

   So haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them,
   that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath.
   Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest
   to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he
   could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more
   systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving
   his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome
   corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaseless with that dull and hideous whine.

   The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with
   crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him
   deeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwen's original operations. He
   thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of the graves which
   had been violated in every part of the world, and of what that final
   raiding party must have seen; and then he decided it was better not to
   think any more. Once a great stone staircase mounted at his right, and he
   deduced that this must have reached to one of the Curwen outbuildings -
   perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slit-like windows -
   provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed
   farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead, and the stench
   and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had come upon a vast
   open space, so great that his torchlight would not carry across it; and as
   he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches
   of the roof.

   After a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of
   Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the
   centre; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached
   to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what they were he
   shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate the dark stains
   which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in
   occasional thin lines. Instead, he found the distant wall and traced it as
   it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black
   doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and
   wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear
   masonry. These cells were empty, but still the horrible odour and the
   dismal moaning continued, more insistent now than ever, and seemingly
   varied at time by a sort of slippery thumping.

                                       3

   From that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willett's attention could
   no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great
   pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being
   far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before
   trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the
   doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very
   loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab
   curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, while at one
   point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder,
   singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the
   frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it
   suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed
   strongest above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude
   trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by
   one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme
   difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to
   a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the
   lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnameable now rose up from below,
   and the doctor's head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned
   his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness.

   If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate
   abomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst that
   foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a
   cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any
   ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone down, the wailing
   changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in conjunction with which
   there came again that sound of blind, futile scrambling and slippery
   thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to imagine what noxious
   thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment mustered up the
   courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length and
   holding the torch downward at arm's length to see what might lie below.
   For a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy, moss-grown brick
   walls sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and
   foulness and anguished frenzy; and then he saw that something dark was
   leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow
   shaft, which must have been from twenty to twenty-five feet below the
   stone floor where he lay. The torch shook in his hand, but he looked again
   to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the
   darkness of that unnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all
   the long month since the doctors had taken him away, and clearly only one
   of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers
   so thickly studded the floor of the great vaulted cavern. Whatever the
   things were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must
   have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous
   weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded.

   But Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for surgeon
   and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not been the same
   since. It is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object
   with measurable dimensions could so shake and change a man; and we may
   only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of
   symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinker's
   perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships
   and unnameable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision.
   In that second look Willett saw such an outline or entity, for during the
   next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark raving mad as any inmate of
   Dr. Waite's private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from a hand
   drained of muscular power or nervous coo:rdination, nor heeded the sound
   of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He
   screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no
   acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not
   rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away from the damp
   pavement where dozens of Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted
   whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on
   the rough, loose stones, and many times bruised his head against the
   frequent pillars, but still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to
   himself in the utter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against
   the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was
   drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light;
   stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed
   with a memory he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things
   still lived, and from one of those shafts the cover was removed. He knew
   that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet
   shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist.

   What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings
   on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this
   form, for it was too palpably unfinished. The deficiencies were of the
   most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion could not be
   described. Willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have
   represented entities which Ward called up from imperfect salts, and which
   he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes. If it had not had a certain
   significance, its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone.
   It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone - but Willett never
   opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind
   was an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested
   long before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous
   confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer:

     'Certainely, there was Noth'g but ye liveliest Awfulness in that which
     H. rais'd upp from What he cou'd gather onlie a part of.'

   Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came
   a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned,
   twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid. Charles
   Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that object; that it
   was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any animal which
   Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.

   These words hummed in the doctor's mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting
   on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the
   Lord's Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic
   hodge-podge like the modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot, and
   finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in
   Ward's underground library: 'Y'ai 'ng'ngah, Yog-Sothoth' and so on till
   the final underlined Zhro.

   It seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time;
   lamenting bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any
   gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would
   not; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or
   reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library. After a
   while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away,
   and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst
   the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he collide with the
   numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had
   uncovered.

   Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps
   leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing.
   At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here
   his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread
   aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain
   him. What had been down there made no sound nor stir. Evidently its
   crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it. Each time
   Willett's fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled. His passage over it
   would sometimes increase the groaning below, but generally it would
   produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. Several times
   during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he realised
   that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by
   one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst
   this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his
   feet and run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open
   pit; for he knew that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and
   survival would lie in whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after
   missing him for a sufficient period. Presently, however, he emerged from
   the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow
   as coming from a door on his right. In a moment he had reached it and was
   standing once more in young Ward's secret library, trembling with relief,
   and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to
   safety.

                                       4

   In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil
   supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he
   looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration.
   For racked though he was with horror, his sense of grim purpose was still
   uppermost; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his
   search for the hideous facts behind Charles Ward's bizarre madness.
   Failing to find a lantern, he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry;
   also filling his pockets with candles and matches, and taking with him a
   gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever
   hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its
   unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again
   would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done.
   Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the
   vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black
   mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search.

   So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished
   howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish
   altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most
   of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some
   evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some
   very curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting
   and dust-draped bales of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he
   saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before.
   In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if
   gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what
   he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally
   appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them
   even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such
   obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible
   above even the general noisomness of the crypt. When he had completed
   about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like
   that from which he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he
   proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size
   and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong
   apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern
   instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles
   proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles Ward - and no
   doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.

   After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr.
   Willett examined the place and all the appurtenances with the keenest
   interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the
   shelves that young Ward's dominant concern must have been with some branch
   of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the
   scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting-table;
   so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the books was a
   tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was weirdly
   interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose
   marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt in Curwen's farmhouse more than
   a century and half before. That old copy, of course, must have perished
   along with the rest of Curwen's occult library in the final raid. Three
   archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to
   sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to
   small storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of
   coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or
   three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing
   also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which
   he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were
   some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwen's
   laboratory appliances. These had suffered damage at the hands of the
   raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia
   of the Georgian period.

   The third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with
   shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps. These lamps
   Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving
   which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly vacant, but
   most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two
   general types; one tall and without handles like a Grecian lekythos or
   oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a
   Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered with
   peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor
   noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the
   lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading
   'Custodes' above them, and all the Phalerons on the other, correspondingly
   labelled with a sign reading 'Materia'.

   Each of the jars of jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out
   to be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a
   catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the
   moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the array as a
   whole, and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at
   random with a view to a rough generalisation. The result was invariable.
   Both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of
   substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of
   dull, neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only point of
   variation there was no apparent method of disposal; and no distinction
   between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the Phalerons.
   A bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one, and any
   one in a Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most
   individual feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett
   would pour one into his hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find
   that no residue whatever remained on his palm.

   The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery
   of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the
   shelves of the laboratory proper. "Custodes", "Materia"; that was the
   Latin for "Guards" and "Materials", respectively - and then there came a
   flash of memory as to where he had seen that word "Guards" before in
   connexion with this dreadful mystery. It was, of course, in the recent
   letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edwin Hutchinson; and the
   phrase had read: 'There was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eat'g
   off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you
   too welle knowe.' What did this signify? But wait - was there not still
   another reference to "guards" in this matter which he had failed wholly to
   recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive
   days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of
   Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there
   had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook
   himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden
   insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of
   his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to
   Hutchinson or his avatar, had "eaten their heads off", so that now Dr.
   Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the
   "salts" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as
   many human bodies or skeletons as they could?

   So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of
   unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as
   to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of
   their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so
   willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in
   and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic
   from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching
   sentinels. Then he thought of the "Materia" - in the myriad Phaleron jugs
   on the other side of the room. Salts too - and if not the salts of
   "guards", then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible that here lay
   the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages; snatched by
   supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe, and subject
   to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for
   some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern, as poor Charles
   had hinted in his frantic note, "all civilisation, all natural law,
   perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe"? And Marinus
   Bicknell Willett had sifted their dust through his hands!

   Then he noticed a small door at the further end of the room, and calmed
   himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above.
   It was only a symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual dread; for a
   morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a
   few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep. It was the sign of
   Koth, that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower
   standing alone in twilight - and Willett did not like what his friend
   Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But a moment later he forgot the
   sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stench-filled air. This was
   a chemical rather than animal smell, and came clearly from the room beyond
   the door. And it was, unmistakably, the same odour which had saturated
   Charles Ward's clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away. So it
   was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons? He was
   wiser that old Joseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, boldly
   determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might
   contain, seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of
   nameless fright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and
   deferred to no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he
   would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed
   his patient.

   The room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture save a
   table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with clamps and
   wheels, which Willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments
   of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips, above
   which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of
   lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side was the table; with a
   powerful Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and two of the stoppered lekythoi
   from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or
   in haste. Willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad, to see
   what notes Ward might have been jotting down when interrupted; but found
   nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that
   crabbed Curwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:

     'B. dy'd not. Escap'd into walls and founde Place below.'
     'Sawe olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt yee Way.'
     'Rais'd Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliver'd.'
     'F. soughte to wipe out all know'g howe to raise Those from Outside.'

   As the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that
   the wall opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing appliances
   in the corners, was covered with pegs from which hung a set of
   shapeless-looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But far more
   interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were thickly covered
   with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed
   stone. The damp floor also bore marks of carving; and with but little
   difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre, with a plain
   circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner. In one
   of these four circles, near where a yellowish robe had been flung
   carelessly down, there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the
   shelves above the whip-rack; and just outside the periphery was one of the
   Phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room, its tag numbered 118.
   This was unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the
   explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow
   area, and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this
   sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish
   efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett
   almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he
   correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the
   scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from
   the jug of "Materia", the two lekythoi from the "Custodes" shelf, the
   robes, the formulae on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from
   letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions
   which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles Ward - all
   these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that
   dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the
   floor.

   With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began
   studying the formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and
   incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwen's
   time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had
   read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic.
   One the doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting
   on that ominous Good Friday a year before, and what an authority had told
   him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the
   normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it
   down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the
   forbidden pages of "Eliphas Levi"; but its identity was unmistakable, and
   such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almonsin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder
   of fright through the search who had seen and felt so much of cosmic
   abomination just around the corner.

   This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand
   wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of
   recognition when he came up the pair of formulae so frequently occurring
   in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same;
   with the ancient symbols of "Dragon's Head" and "Dragon's Tail" heading
   them as in Ward's scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from
   that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen had had a different way of
   recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more powerful and
   perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to
   reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently
   in his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised
   began "Y'ai 'ng'ngah, Yog-Sothoth", this epigraph started out as "Aye,
   engengah, Yogge-Sothotha"; which to his mind would seriously interfere
   with the syllabification of the second word.

   Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy
   disturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae
   aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he
   found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang
   his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the
   spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that
   dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell
   rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness.

                                 Y'AI 'NG'NGAH,
                                  YOG-SOTHOTH
                                   H'EE-L'GEB
                                  F'AI THRODOG
                                     UAAAH!

   But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset
   of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so
   dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was
   smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the
   far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely
   stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the
   room with its bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in
   which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth a cloud
   of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity. That
   powder - Great God! it had come from the shelf of "Materia" - what was it
   doing now, and what had started it? The formula he had been chanting - the
   first of the pair - Dragon's Head, ascending node - Blessed Saviour, could
   it be ...

   The doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps
   from all he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph
   Curwen and Charles Dexter Ward. "I say to you againe, doe not call up Any
   that you can not put downe ... Have ye Wordes for laying at all times
   readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have
   ... 3 Talkes with What was therein inhum'd ..." Mercy of Heaven, what is
   that shape behind the parting smoke?

                                       5

   Marinus Bicknell Willett has not hope that any part of his tale will be
   believed except by certain sympathetic friends, hence he has made no
   attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few outsiders
   have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh and remark
   that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised to take a long
   vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance. But Mr.
   Ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth. Did
   not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar? Did not
   Willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven o'clock that portentous
   morning? Did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening, and again
   the next day, and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that
   following noon, finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the
   beds upstairs? Willett had been breathing stertorously, and opened his
   eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car. Then
   he shuddered and screamed, crying out, 'That beard... those eyes... God,
   who are you?' A very strange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed,
   clean-shaven gentleman whom he had known from the latter's boyhood.

   In the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous
   morning. Willett's clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges
   and worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid odour reminded Mr.
   Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the
   hospital. The doctor's flashlight was missing, but his valise was safely
   there, as empty as when he had brought it. Before indulging in any
   explanations, and obviously with great moral effort, Willett staggered
   dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs.
   It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool
   satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the
   stubborn planks one by one. Underneath the smooth concrete was still
   visible, but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace.
   Nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed
   the doctor downstairs; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks - no
   noisome well, no world of subterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen
   papers, no nightmare pits of stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves
   or chiselled formulae, no... Dr. Willett turned pale, and clutched at the
   younger man. 'Yesterday,' he asked softly, 'did you see it here ... and
   smell it?' And when Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder,
   found strength to nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a
   sigh and half a gasp, and nodded in turn. 'Then I will tell you', he said.

   So for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the
   physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There was
   nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the
   greenish-black vapour from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired to
   ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered
   head-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed
   suggestion, 'Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?' The doctor was
   silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when
   powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the
   Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, 'But where did it go? It brought you
   here, you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.' And Willett again let
   silence answer for him.

   But after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for
   his handkerchief before rising to leave, Dr. Willett's fingers closed upon
   a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before, and which
   was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished
   vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the cheap pad in that
   fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and the writing upon it was
   that of an ordinary lead pencil - doubtless the one which had lain beside
   the pad. It was folded very carelessly, and beyond the faint acrid scent
   of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this. But in
   the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder; for here was no script of
   any wholesome age, but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness,
   scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it, yet having
   combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar. The briefly
   scrawled message was this, and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken
   pair, who forthwith walked steadily out to the Ward car and gave orders to
   be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the John Hay Library
   on the hill.

   At the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and over
   these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the
   great chandelier. In the end they found what was needed. The letters were
   indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script of a very dark
   period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth
   century A.D., and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under
   a fresh Christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred
   stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked sometimes on strange deeds
   in the Roman ruins of Caerleon and Hexham, and by the towers along
   Hadrian's crumbling wall. The words were in such Latin as a barbarous age
   might remember - 'Corvinus necandus est. Cadaver aq(ua) forti
   dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d retinendum. Tace ut potes.' - which may
   roughly be translated, "Curwen must be killed. The body must be dissolved
   in aqua fortis, nor must anything be retained. Keep silence as best you
   are able."

   Willett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown, and
   found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed
   they ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for receiving fresh
   impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both men sat still and
   helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave. Then they
   drove listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect Street, and talked to no
   purpose into the night. The doctor rested toward morning, but did not go
   home. And he was still there Sunday noon when a telephone message came
   from the detectives who had been assigned to look up Dr. Allen.

   Mr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered the
   call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when he
   heard their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad that
   this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin of the
   strange minuscule message, it seemed certain the "Curwen" who must be
   destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger.
   Charles had feared this man, and had said in the frantic note that he must
   be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, moreover, had been receiving
   letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name of Curwen, and
   palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer. And now
   from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that "Curwen"
   must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage was too unmistakable to
   be factitious; and besides, was not Allen planning to murder young Ward
   upon the advice of the creature called Hutchinson? Of course, the letter
   they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger; but from its text
   they could see that Allen had already formed plans for dealing with the
   youth if he grew too "squeamish". Without doubt, Allen must be
   apprehended; and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out,
   he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward.

   That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information
   anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving
   it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young
   Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett told him all he had
   found, and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the
   truth of the discovery. The physician employed as much dramatic effect as
   he could, and watched for a wincing on Charles's part when he approached
   the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward
   did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of
   how the things were starving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity,
   and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having
   dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist, seemed to
   see some ghastly jest in this affair; and chucked hoarsely at something
   which amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible because of
   the cracked voice he used, 'Damn 'em, they do eat, but they don't need to!
   That's the rare part! A month, you say, without food? Lud, Sir, you be
   modest! D'ye know, that was the joke on poor old Whipple with his virtuous
   bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why, damme, he was half-deaf with
   noise from Outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells! He never
   dreamed they were there at all! Devil take ye, those cursed things have
   been howling down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and
   fifty-seven years gone!'

   But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet
   almost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope
   that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he
   maintained. Looking at the youth's face, the doctor could not but feel a
   kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the
   boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the
   formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first
   sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what
   Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured the mild statement that those
   notes were old ones, of no possible significance to anyone not deeply
   initiated in the history of magic. But, he added, 'had you but known the
   words to bring up that which I had out in the cup, you had not been here
   to tell me this. 'Twas Number 118, and I conceive you would have shook had
   you looked it up in my list in t'other room. 'Twas never raised by me, but
   I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.'

   Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black
   smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the
   first time on Charles Ward's face. 'It came, and you be here alive?' As
   Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its
   trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett,
   gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and
   wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered. 'No. 118, you
   say? But don't forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out
   of ten. You are never sure till you question!' And then, without warning,
   he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patient's
   eyes. He could have wished no stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted
   forthwith.

   All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest
   secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of
   encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett and Mr.
   Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch. In
   reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to
   Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back
   the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his
   bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his assassination. This
   revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was made the visitors
   could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man. After that
   he would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently;
   leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth
   only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and could
   do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil
   chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications
   Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew
   that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and
   would pass no wild or outre-looking missive.

   There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson,
   if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment
   amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international
   press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents
   in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that
   he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he
   received and had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by
   night in the oldest quarter of Prague, and the disappearance of the evil
   old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone
   could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the Transylvanian
   mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of
   the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by
   peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to
   Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career
   already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that
   the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons
   as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer
   felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. If what their
   fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think.

                                       6

   The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present
   when the detectives arrived. Allen's destruction or imprisonment - or
   Curwen's if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid -
   he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and he communicated this
   conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the men to come. They were
   downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the house were beginning to
   be shunned because of a particular nauseousness which hung indefinitely
   about; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse
   left by the vanished Curwen portrait.

   At nine o'clock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately
   delivered all that they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough,
   located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished, nor had they found the
   least trace of Dr. Allen's source or present whereabouts; but they had
   managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts
   concerning the reticent stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a
   vaguely unnatural being, and there was a universal belief that his thick
   sandy beard was either dyed or false - a belief conclusively upheld by the
   finding of such a false beard, together with a pair of dark glasses, in
   his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify
   from his one telephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could
   not be forgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and
   horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had
   seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and
   crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found
   in his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the
   vampirism rumours of the preceding summer, a majority of the gossips
   believed that Allen rather than Ward was the actual vampire. Statements
   were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after
   the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of
   the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had recognised him as the dominant figure
   in the queer shadowy cottage. The place had been too dark for them to
   observe him clearly, but they would know him again if they saw him. His
   beard had looked odd, and they thought he had some slight scar above his
   dark spectacled right eye. As for the detectives' search of Allen's room,
   it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses, and several
   pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which Willett at once saw was
   identical with that shared by the old Curwen manuscripts and by the
   voluminous recent notes of young Ward found in the vanished catacombs of
   horror.

   Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and
   insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded, and
   almost trembled in following up the vague, mad thought which had
   simultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses - the
   crabbed Curwen penmanship - the old portrait and its tiny scar - and the
   altered youth in the hospital with such a scar - that deep, hollow voice
   on the telephone - was it not of this that Mr. Ward was reminded when his
   son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be
   reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, the officials
   had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that Charles
   suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow?
   Curwen - Allen - Ward - in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two
   ages and two persons become involved? That damnable resemblance of the
   picture to Charles - had it not used to stare and stare, and follow the
   boy around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did both Allen and Charles
   copy Joseph Curwen's handwriting, even when alone and off guard? And then
   the frightful work of those people - the lost crypt of horrors that had
   aged the doctor overnight; the starving monsters in the noisome pits; the
   awful formula which had yielded such nameless results; the message in
   minuscules found in Willett's pocket; the papers and the letters and all
   the talk of graves and "salts" and discoveries - whither did everything
   lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the most sensible thing. Steeling himself
   against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an
   article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the
   portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son,
   on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the
   black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allen's room.

   For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear
   and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs
   library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The
   altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward
   turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his
   handkerchief. Allen - Ward - Curwen - it was becoming too hideous for
   coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void, and what had it
   done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? Who was this
   Allen who sought to kill Charles as too "squeamish", and why had his
   destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must
   be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message,
   of whose origin no one dared think, said that "Curwen" must be likewise
   obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred?
   That day when his frantic note was received - he had been nervous all the
   morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and
   swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time,
   when he was out. But no - had he not cried out in terror as he entered his
   study - this very room? What had he found there? Or wait - what had found
   him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to
   go - was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling
   figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer
   noises?

   Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had,
   surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises - a cry, a gasp,
   a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of
   these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out without a
   word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that
   blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely
   upon the house, and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a
   full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this case had held vague
   elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr. Willett was
   thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and
   then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a
   new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings.

   Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save
   him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of
   coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began
   talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal
   of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain
   obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As
   family physician he must have a free hand, and the first thing he required
   was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs,
   where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome
   horror more intense than when Joseph Curwen's features themselves glanced
   slyly down from the painted panel.

   Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably
   maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only
   acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned
   room with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside,
   heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and
   finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being
   opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a
   hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled
   and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood
   for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The furnace was not
   enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing
   yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a
   man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air
   of the library to place them in the grate. Willett meanwhile had gone up
   to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not
   included in the moving of the July before. They were in a covered basket,
   and Mr. Ward never saw what they were.

   Then the doctor locked himself in the library once more, and by the clouds
   of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known
   that he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling of newspapers,
   that odd wrench and creaking were heard again; followed by a thumping
   which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two suppressed cries of
   Willett's were heard, and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of
   indefinable hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the wind beat down from
   the chimney grew very dark and acrid, and everyone wished that the weather
   had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes.
   Mr. Ward's head reeled, and the servants all clustered together in a knot
   to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down. After an age of waiting the
   vapours seemed to lighted, and half-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping,
   and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door. And at last,
   after the slamming of some cupboard within, Willett made his appearance -
   sad, pale, and haggard, and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken
   from the upstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, and into that
   once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with
   a queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still lingered;
   but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and stately in its
   white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of Joseph Curwen.
   Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held no latent fright, but
   only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done the doctor would never
   speak. To Mr. Ward he said, 'I can answer no questions, but I will say
   that there are different kinds of magic. I have made a great purgation,
   and those in this house will sleep the better for it.'

                                       7

   That Dr. Willett's "purgation" had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking
   in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the
   fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached
   home that evening. For three days he rested constantly in his room, though
   servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on
   Wednesday, when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal
   softness. Servants' imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment
   might have been excited by an item in Thursday's Evening Bulletin which
   ran as follows:

                         North End Ghouls Again Active

     After a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden
     lot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early
     this morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman.
     Happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m., Hart
     observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest,
     and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel
     very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light. At once
     starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main
     entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before
     approach or capture was possible.

     Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder
     had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot
     shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but nothing even nearly
     the size of a grave had been attempted, and no previous grave had been
     disturbed.

     Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably
     having a full beard, inclines to the view that all three of the digging
     incidents have a common source; but police from the Second Station think
     otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident, where
     an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shattered.

     The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury
     something was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been
     attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt.
     Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature. Officers at the
     Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of
     miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.

   All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past
   or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note
   to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the
   half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward had not been able to
   go down to business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports
   and its sinister "purgation", but he found something calming about the
   doctor's letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh
   mysteries it seemed to evoke.

                                                               10 Barnes St.,
                                                            Providence, R. I.

     April 12, 1928.

     Dear Theodore:-

     I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going to do
     tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going
     through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous
     place we know of), but I'm afraid it won't set your mind at rest unless
     I expressly assure you how very conclusive it is.

     You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will
     not distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided
     and unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation as
     to Charles's case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother
     nothing more than she already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow
     Charles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in anyone's
     mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You can tell his mother gently and
     gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in
     his name. I'd advise you to join her in Atlantic City and take a rest
     yourself. God knows you need one after this shock, as I do myself. I am
     going South for a while to calm down and brace up.

     So don't ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will
     go wrong, but I'll tell you if it does. I don't think it will. There
     will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be very, very
     safe. He is now - safer than you dream. You need hold no fears about
     Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of the past as
     Joseph Curwen's picture, and when I ring your doorbell you may feel
     certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that minuscule
     message will never trouble you or yours.

     But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do
     the same. I must tell you frankly that Charles's escape will not mean
     his restoration to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar disease,
     as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes
     in him, and you must not hope to see him again. Have only this
     consolation - that he was never a fiend or even truly a madman, but only
     an eager, studious, and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the
     past was his undoing. He stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to
     know, and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach;
     and something came out of those years to engulf him.

     And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of
     all. For there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charles's fate. In
     about a year, say, you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the
     end; for the boy will be no more. You can put up a stone in your lot at
     the North Burial Ground exactly ten feet west of your father's and
     facing the same way, and that will mark the true resting-place of your
     son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling.
     The ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and
     sinew - of the real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from
     infancy - the real Charles with the olive-mark on his hip and without
     the black witch-mark on his chest or the pit on his forehead. The
     Charles who never did actual evil, and who will have paid with his life
     for his "squeamishness".

     That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can put
     up his stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the honour
     of your ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been at all
     times in the past.

     With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness, and
     resignation, I am ever

                                                       Sincerely your friend,
                                                          Marinus B. Willett.

   So on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett
   visited the room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waite's private hospital on
   Conanicut Island. The youth, though making no attempt to evade his caller,
   was in a sullen mood; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation
   which Willett obviously desired. The doctor's discovery of the crypt and
   his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of
   embarrassment, so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of
   a few strained formalities. Then a new element of constraint crept in, as
   Ward seemed to read behind the doctor's mask-like face a terrible purpose
   which had never been there before. The patient quailed, conscious that
   since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family
   physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avenger.

   Ward actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak. 'More,'
   he said, 'has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a reckoning
   is due.'

   'Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?' was the ironic
   reply. It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last.

   'No,' Willett slowly rejoined, 'this time I did not have to dig. We have
   had men looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and
   spectacles in the bungalow.'

   'Excellent,' commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily
   insulting, 'and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and
   glasses you now have on!'

   'They would become you very well,' came the even and studied response, 'as
   indeed they seem to have done.'

   As Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the
   sun; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then Ward
   ventured:

   'And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does find
   it now and then useful to be twofold?'

   'No', said Willett gravely, 'again you are wrong. It is no business of
   mine if any man seeks duality; provided he has any right to exist at all,
   and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space.'

   Ward now started violently. 'Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what d'ye
   want of me?'

   The doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his
   words for an effective answer.

   'I have found', he finally intoned, 'something in a cupboard behind an
   ancient overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and
   buried the ashes where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.'

   The madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting:

   'Damn ye, who did ye tell - and who'll believe it was he after these two
   full months, with me alive? What d'ye mean to do?'

   Willett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial majesty
   as he calmed the patient with a gesture.

   'I have told no one. This is no common case - it is a madness out of time
   and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts
   or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with. Thank God some chance has
   left inside me the spark of imagination, that I might not go astray in
   thinking out this thing. You cannot deceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know
   that your accursed magic is true!'

   'I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened
   on your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into the past and
   got him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I know how he kept you
   hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad
   as a vampire by night, and how you later shewed yourself in beard and
   glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him; I know
   what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the
   world's tombs, and at what you planned afterward , and I know how you did
   it.'

   'You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the
   house. They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it was he who
   came out when you had strangled and hidden him. But you hadn't reckoned on
   the different contents of two minds. You were a fool, Joseph Curwen, to
   fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough. Why didn't you think of
   the speech and the voice and the handwriting? It hasn't worked, you see,
   after all. You know better than I who or what wrote that message in
   minuscules, but I will warn you it was not written in vain. There are
   abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I believe that
   the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those
   creatures wrote you once, "do not call up any that you can not put down".
   You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that
   your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man can't tamper
   with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will
   rise up to wipe you out.'

   But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature
   before him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of
   physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctor's
   rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a
   series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow
   voice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening
   words of a terrible formula.

   'PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON ...'

   But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside
   began to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay,
   the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he
   had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye - magic for magic - let
   the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in
   a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of
   formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules - the
   cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragon's Tail, sign of the
   descending node -

                                  OGTHROD AI'F
                                   GEB'L-EE'H
                                  YOG-SOTHOTH
                                 'NGAH'NG AI'Y
                                     ZHRO!

   At the very first word from Willett's mouth the previously commenced
   formula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made
   wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful
   name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not
   merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and
   Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation
   could be pronounced.

   But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden
   secrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had
   subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his eyes
   before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that what he
   had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he had
   predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture a year
   before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of
   fine bluish-grey dust.
