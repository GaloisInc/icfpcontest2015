Little Tiger

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                     Little Tiger, burning bright           
                     With a subtle Blakeish light,          
                     Tell what visions have their home      
                     In those eyes of flame and chrome!     
                     Children vex thee - thoughtless, gay - 
                     Holding when thou wouldst away:        
                     What dark lore is that which thou,     
                     Spitting, mixest with thy meow?
