The City

  by H. P. Lovecraft

It was golden and splendid,                                                      
  That City of light;                                                            
A vision suspended                                                               
  In deeps of the night;                                                         
A region of wonder and glory, whose temples were marble and white.               
                                                                                 
I remember the season                                                            
  It dawn'd on my gaze;                                                          
The mad time of unreason,                                                        
  The brain-numbing days                                                         
When Winter, white-sheeted and ghastly, stalks onward to torture and craze.      
                                                                                 
More lovely than Zion                                                            
  It shone in the sky                                                            
When the beams of Orion                                                          
  Beclouded my eye,                                                              
Bringing sleep that was filled with dim mem'ries of moments obscure and gone by. 
                                                                                 
Its mansions were stately,                                                       
  With carvings made fair,                                                       
Each rising sedately                                                             
  On terraces rare,                                                              
And the gardens were fragrant and bright with strange miracles blossoming there. 
                                                                                 
The avenues lur'd me                                                             
  With vistas sublime;                                                           
Tall arches assur'd me                                                           
  That once on a time                                                            
I had wander'd in rapture beneath them, and bask'd in the Halcyon clime.         
                                                                                 
On the plazas were standing                                                      
  A sculptur'd array;                                                            
Long bearded, commanding,                                                        
  rave men in their day--                                                        
But one stood dismantled and broken, its bearded face battered away.             
                                                                                 
In that city effulgent                                                           
  No mortal I saw,                                                               
But my fancy, indulgent                                                          
  To memory's law,                                                               
Linger'd long on the forms in the plazas, and eyed their stone features with     
awe.                                                                             
                                                                                 
I fann'd the faint ember                                                         
  That glow'd in my mind,                                                        
And strove to remember                                                           
  The aeons behind;                                                              
To rove thro' infinity freely, and visit the past unconfin'd.                    
                                                                                 
Then the horrible warning                                                        
  Upon my soul sped                                                              
Like the ominous morning                                                         
  That rises in red,                                                             
And in panic I flew from the knowledge of terrors forgotten and dead.
