   Of the events which took place at the Norton Mine on October eighteenth
   and nineteenth, 1894, I have no desire to speak. A sense of duty to
   science is all that impels me to recall, in the last years of my life,
   scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute because I cannot
   wholly define it. But I believe that before I die I should tell what I
   know of the - shall I say transition - of Juan Romero.

   My name and origin need not be related to posterity; in fact, I fancy it
   is better that they should not be, for when a man suddenly migrates to the
   States or the Colonies, he leaves his past behind him. Besides, what I
   once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative; save perhaps the
   fact that during my service in India I was more at home amongst
   white-bearded native teachers than amongst my brother-officers. I had
   delved not a little into odd Eastern lore when overtaken by the calamities
   which brought about my new life in America's vast West - a life wherein I
   found it well to accept a name - my present one - which is very common and
   carries no meaning.

   In the summer and autumn of 1894 I dwelt in the drear expanses of the
   Cactus Mountains, employed as a common labourer at the celebrated Norton
   Mine, whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before had turned
   the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a seething
   cauldron of sordid life. A cavern of gold, lying deep beneath a mountain
   lake, had enriched its venerable finder beyond his wildest dreams, and now
   formed the seat of extensive tunneling operations on the part of the
   corporation to which it had finally been sold. Additional grottoes had
   been found, and the yield of yellow metal was exceedingly great; so that a
   mighty and heterogeneous army of miners toiled day and night in the
   numerous passages and rock hollows. The Superintendent, a Mr. Arthur,
   often discussed the singularity of the local geological formations;
   speculating on the probable extent of the chain of caves, and estimating
   the future of the titanic mining enterprises. He considered the auriferous
   cavities the result of the action of water, and believed the last of them
   would soon be opened.

   It was not long after my arrival and employment that Juan Romero came to
   the Norton Mine. One of the large herd of unkempt Mexicans attracted
   thither from the neighbouring country, he at first attracted attention
   only because of his features; which though plainly of the Red Indian type,
   were yet remarkable for their light colour and refined conformation, being
   vastly unlike those of the average "greaser" or Piute of the locality. It
   is curious that although he differed so widely from the mass of
   Hispanicised and tribal Indians, Romero gave not the least impression of
   Caucasian blood. It was not the Castilian conquistador or the American
   pioneer, but the ancient and noble Aztec, whom imagination called to view
   when the silent peon would rise in the early morning and gaze in
   fascination at the sun as it crept above the eastern hills, meanwhile
   stretching out his arms to the orb as if in the performance of some rite
   whose nature he did not himself comprehend. But save for his face, Romero
   was not in any way suggestive of nobility. Ignorant and dirty, he was at
   home amongst the other brown-skinned Mexicans; having come (so I was
   afterward told) from the very lowest sort of surroundings. He had been
   found as a child in a crude mountain hut, the only survivor of an epidemic
   which had stalked lethally by. Near the hut, close to a rather unusual
   rock fissure, had lain two skeletons, newly picked by vultures, and
   presumably forming the sole remains of his parents. No one recalled their
   identity, and they were soon forgotten by the many. Indeed, the crumbling
   of the adobe hut and the closing of the rock-fissure by a subsequent
   avalanche had helped to efface even the scene from recollection. Reared by
   a Mexican cattle-thief who had given him his name, Juan differed little
   from his fellows.

   The attachment which Romero manifested toward me was undoubtedly commenced
   through the quaint and ancient Hindoo ring which I wore when not engaged
   in active labour. Of its nature, and manner of coming into my possession,
   I cannot speak. It was my last link with a chapter of my life forever
   closed, and I valued it highly. Soon I observed that the odd-looking
   Mexican was likewise interested; eyeing it with an expression that
   banished all suspicion of mere covetousness. Its hoary hieroglyphs seemed
   to stir some faint recollection in his untutored but active mind, though
   he could not possibly have beheld their like before. Within a few weeks
   after his advent, Romero was like a faithful servant to me; this
   notwithstanding the fact that I was myself but an ordinary miner. Our
   conversation was necessarily limited. He knew but a few words of English,
   while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from the
   patois of the peon of New Spain.

   The event which I am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions.
   Though the man Romero had interested me, and though my ring had affected
   him peculiarly, I think that neither of us had any expectation of what was
   to follow when the great blast was set off. Geological considerations had
   dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part
   of the subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only
   solid rock would be encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious
   charge of dynamite. With this work Romero and I were not connected,
   wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from
   others. The charge, heavier perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to
   shake the entire mountain. Windows in shanties on the slope outside were
   shattered by the shock, whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were
   knocked from their feet. Jewel Lake, which lay above the scene of action,
   heaved as in a tempest. Upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss
   yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast; an abyss so monstrous
   that no handy line might fathom it, nor any lamp illuminate it. Baffled,
   the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent, who ordered
   great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced and lowered
   without cessation till a bottom might be discovered.

   Shortly afterward the pale-faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of
   their failure. Firmly though respectfully, they signified their refusal to
   revisit the chasm or indeed to work further in the mine until it might be
   sealed. Something beyond their experience was evidently confronting them,
   for so far as they could ascertain, the void below was infinite. The
   Superintendent did not reproach them. Instead, he pondered deeply, and
   made plans for the following day. The night shift did not go on that
   evening.

   At two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl
   dismally. From somewhere within the works a dog barked an answer; either
   to the coyote - or to something else. A storm was gathering around the
   peaks of the range, and weirdly shaped clouds scudded horribly across the
   blurred patch of celestial light which marked a gibbous moon's attempts to
   shine through many layers of cirro-stratus vapours. It was Romero's voice,
   coming from the bunk above, that awakened me, a voice excited and tense
   with some vague expectation I could not understand:

   "Madre de Dios! - el sonido - ese sonido - oiga Vd! - lo oye Vd? - senor,
   THAT SOUND!"

   I listened, wondering what sound he meant. The coyote, the dog, the storm,
   all were audible; the last named now gaining ascendancy as the wind
   shrieked more and more frantically. Flashes of lightning were visible
   through the bunk-house window. I questioned the nervous Mexican, repeating
   the sounds I had heard:

   "El coyote - el perro - el viento?"

   But Romero did not reply. Then he commenced whispering as in awe:

   "El ritmo, senor - el ritmo de la tierra - THAT THROB DOWN IN THE GROUND!"

   And now I also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why. Deep,
   deep, below me was a sound - a rhythm, just as the peon had said - which,
   though exceedingly faint, yet dominated even the dog, the coyote, and the
   increasing tempest. To seek to describe it was useless - for it was such
   that no description is possible. Perhaps it was like the pulsing of the
   engines far down in a great liner, as sensed from the deck, yet it was not
   so mechanical; not so devoid of the element of the life and consciousness.
   Of all its qualities, remoteness in the earth most impressed me. To my
   mind rushed fragments of a passage in Joseph Glanvil which Poe has quoted
   with tremendous effect1:

   "..... the vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which
   have a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus."

   Suddenly Romero leaped from his bunk, pausing before me to gaze at the
   strange ring on my hand, which glistened queerly in every flash of
   lightning, and then staring intently in the direction of the mine shaft. I
   also rose, and both of us stood motionless for a time, straining our ears
   as the uncanny rhythm seemed more and more to take on a vital quality.
   Then without apparent volition we began to move toward the door, whose
   rattling in the gale held a comforting suggestion of earthly reality. The
   chanting in the depths - for such the sound now seemed to be - grew in
   volume and distinctness; and we felt irresistibly urged out into the storm
   and thence to the gaping blackness of the shaft.

   We encountered no living creature, for the men of the night shift had been
   released from duty, and were doubtless at the Dry Gulch settlement pouring
   sinister rumours into the ear of some drowsy bartender. From the
   watchman's cabin, however, gleamed a small square of yellow light like a
   guardian eye. I dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had affected the
   watchman; but Romero was moving more swiftly now, and I followed without
   pausing.

   As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite. It
   struck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating of
   drums and chanting of many voices. I have, as you are aware, been much in
   India. Romero and I moved without material hesitancy through drifts and
   down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us, yet ever with a
   pitifully helpless fear and reluctance. At one time I fancied I had gone
   mad - this was when, on wondering how our way was lighted in the absence
   of lamp or candle, I realized that the ancient ring on my finger was
   glowing with eerie radiance, diffusing a pallid lustre through the damp,
   heavy air around.

   It was without warning that Romero, after clambering down one of the many
   wide ladders, broke into a run and left me alone. Some new and wild note
   in the drumming and chanting, perceptible but slightly to me, had acted on
   him in a startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he forged ahead
   unguided in the cavern's gloom. I heard his repeated shrieks before me, as
   he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the
   rickety ladders. And frightened as I was, I yet retained enough of my
   perception to note that his speech, when articulate, was not of any sort
   known to me. Harsh but impressive polysyllables had replaced the customary
   mixture of bad Spanish and worse English, and of these, only the oft
   repeated cry "Huitzilopotchli" seemed in the least familiar. Later I
   definitely placed that word in the works of a great historian2 - and
   shuddered when the association came to me.

   The climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief, beginning
   just as I reached the final cavern of the journey. Out of the darkness
   immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the Mexican, which was joined
   by such a chorus of uncouth sound as I could never hear again and survive.
   In that moment it seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrosities of
   earth had become articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race.
   Simultaneously the light from my ring was extinguished, and I saw a new
   light glimmering from lower space but a few yards ahead of me. I had
   arrived at the abyss, which was now redly aglow, and which had evidently
   swallowed up the unfortunate Romero. Advancing, I peered over the edge of
   that chasm which no line could fathom, and which was now a pandemonium of
   flickering flame and hideous uproar. At first I beheld nothing but a
   seething blur of luminosity; but then shapes, all infinitely distant,
   began to detach themselves from the confusion, and I saw - was it Juan
   Romero? - but God! I dare not tell you what I saw! ...Some power from
   heaven, coming to my aid, obliterated both sights and sounds in such a
   crash as may be heard when two universes collide in space. Chaos
   supervened, and I knew the peace of oblivion.

   I hardly know how to continue, since conditions so singular are involved;
   but I will do my best, not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real
   and the apparent. When I awakened, I was safe in my bunk and the red glow
   of dawn was visible at the window. Some distance away the lifeless body of
   Juan Romero lay upon a table, surrounded by a group of men, including the
   camp doctor. The men were discussing the strange death of the Mexican as
   he lay asleep; a death seemingly connected in some way with the terrible
   bolt of lightning which had struck and shaken the mountain. No direct
   cause was evident, and an autopsy failed to show any reason why Romero
   should not be living. Snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt
   that neither Romero nor I had left the bunk-house during the night; that
   neither of us had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed
   over the Cactus range. That storm, said men who had ventured down the mine
   shaft, had caused extensive caving-in, and had completely closed the deep
   abyss which had created so much apprehension the day before. When I asked
   the watchman what sounds he had heard prior to the mighty thunder-bolt; he
   mentioned a coyote, a dog, and the snarling mountain wind - nothing more.
   Nor do I doubt his word.

   Upon the resumption of work, Superintendent Arthur called upon some
   especially dependable men to make a few investigations around the spot
   where the gulf had appeared. Though hardly eager, they obeyed, and a deep
   boring was made. Results were very curious. The roof of the void, as seen
   when it was open, was not by any means thick; yet now the drills of the
   investigators met what appeared to be a limitless extent of solid rock.
   Finding nothing else, not even gold, the Superintendent abandoned his
   attempts; but a perplexed look occasionally steals over his countenance as
   he sits thinking at his desk.

   One other thing is curious. Shortly after waking on that morning after the
   storm, I noticed the unaccountable absence of my Hindoo ring from my
   finger. I had prized it greatly, yet nevertheless felt a sensation of
   relief at its disappearance. If one of my fellow-miners appropriated it,
   he must have been quite clever in disposing of his booty, for despite
   advertisements and a police search, the ring was never seen again. Somehow
   I doubt if it was stolen by mortal hands, for many strange things were
   taught me in India.

   My opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time. In broad
   daylight, and at most seasons I am apt to think the greater part of it a
   mere dream; but sometimes in the autumn, about two in the morning when the
   winds and animals howl dismally, there comes from inconceivable depths
   below a damnable suggestion of rhythmical throbbing ...and I feel that the
   transition of Juan Romero was a terrible one indeed.
