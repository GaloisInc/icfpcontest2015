On Receiving a Picture of Swans

  by H. P. Lovecraft

   "Impromtu verse, or 'poetry' to order, is easy only when approached in the
   cooly prosaic sprit. Given something to say, a metrical mechanic like
   myself can easily hammer the matter into technically correct verse,
   substituting formal poetic diction for real inspiration or thought. For
   instance, I lately received a post-card bearing the picture of swans on a
   placid stream. Desiring to reply in appropriate verse, I harked back to
   the classic myth of Phaethon and Cygnus, handling it as follows:

                With pensive grace, the melancholy Swan          
                Mourns o'er the tomb of luckless Phaethon;       
                On grassy banks the weeping poplars wave,        
                And guard with tender card the wat'ry grave.     
                Would that I might, should I too proudly claim   
                An Heav'nly parent, or a God-like fame;          
                When flown too high, and dash'd to depths below, 
                Receive such tribute as a Cygnus' woe!           
                The faithful bird, that dumbly floats along,     
                Sighs all the deeper for his want of song.       

   "This required about 10 minutes of composition."

                                        - in a letter to Robert Kleiner, 1915
