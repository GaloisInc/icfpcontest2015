Astrophobos

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                   In the Midnight heaven's burning          
                   Through the ethereal deeps afar           
                   Once I watch'd with restless yearning     
                   An alluring aureate star;                 
                   Ev'ry eve aloft returning                 
                   Gleaming nigh the Arctic Car.             
                                                             
                   Mystic waves of beauty blended            
                   With the gorgeous golden rays             
                   Phantasies of bliss descended             
                   In a myrrh'd Elysian haze.                
                   In the lyre-born chords extended          
                   Harmonies of Lydian lays.                 
                                                             
                   And (thought I) lies scenes of pleasure,  
                   Where the free and blessed dwell,         
                   And each moment bears a treasure,         
                   Freighted with the lotos-spell,           
                   And there floats a liquid measure         
                   From the lute of Israfel.                 
                                                             
                   There (I told myself) were shining        
                   Worlds of happiness unknown,              
                   Peace and Innocence entwining             
                   By the Crowned Virtue's throne;           
                   Men of light, their thoughts refining     
                   Purer, fairer, than my own.               
                                                             
                   Thus I mus'd when o'er the vision         
                   Crept a red delirious change;             
                   Hope dissolving to derision,              
                   Beauty to distortion strange;             
                   Hymnic chords in weird collision,         
                   Spectral sights in endless range....      
                   Crimson burn'd the star of madness        
                   As behind the beams I peer'd;             
                   All was woe that seem'd but gladness      
                   Ere my gaze with Truth was sear'd;        
                   Cacodaemons, mir'd with madness,          
                   Through the fever'd flick'ring leer'd.... 
                   Now I know the fiendish fable             
                   The the golden glitter bore;              
                   Now I shun the spangled sable             
                   That I watch'd and lov'd before;          
                   But the horror, set and stable,           
                   Haunts my soul forevermore!
