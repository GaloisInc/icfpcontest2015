On Reading Lord Dunsany's Book of Wonder

  by H. P. Lovecraft

                    The hours of night unheeded fly,        
                    And in the grate the embers fade;       
                    Vast shadows one by one pass by         
                    In silent daemon cavalcade.             
                                                            
                    But still the magic volume holds        
                    The raptur'd eye in realms apart,       
                    And fulgent sorcery enfolds             
                    The willing mind and eager heart.       
                                                            
                    The lonely room no more is there -      
                    For to the sight in pomp appear         
                    Temples and cities pois'd in air        
                    And blazing glories - sphere on sphere.
