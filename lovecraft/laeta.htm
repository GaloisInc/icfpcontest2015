				<p>How sad droop the willows by Zalal's fair side,
				<br>Where so lately I stray'd with my raven-hair'd bride;
				<br>Ev'ry light-floating lily, each flow'r on the shore,
				<br>Folds in sorrow since Laeta can see them no more!
				<p>Oh blest were the days when in childhood and hope
				<br>With my Laeta I rov'd o'er the blossom-clad slope,
				<br>Plucking white meadow-daisies and ferns by the stream,
				<br>As we laugh'd at the ripples that twinkle and gleam.
				<p>Not a bloom deck'd the mead that could rival in grace
				<br>The dear innocent charms of my Laeta's fair face;
				<br>Not a thrush thrill'd the grove with a carol so choice
				<br>As the silvery strains of my Laeta's sweet voice.
				<p>The shy nymphs of the woodlands, the fount, and the plain,
				<br>Strove to equal her beauty, but strove all in vain;
				<br>Yet no envy they bore her, while fruitless they strove,
				<br>For so pure was my Laeta, they could only love!
				<p>When the warm breath of Auster play'd soft o'er the flow'rs,
				<br>And young Zephyrus rustled the gay scented bow'rs,
				<br>Ev'ry breeze seem'd to pause as it drew near the fair,
				<br>Too much aw'd at her sweetness to tumble her hair.
				<p>How fond were our dreams on the day when we stood
				<br>In the ivy-grown temple beside the dark wood;
				<br>When our pledges we seal'd at the sanctify'd shrine,
				<br>And I knew that my Laeta forever was mine!
				<p>How blissful our thoughts when the wild autumn came,
				<br>And the forests with scarlet and gold were aflame;
				<br>Yet how heavy my heart when I first felt the fear
				<br>That my starry-eyed Laeta would fade with the year!
				<p>The pastures were sere and the heavens were grey
				<br>When I laid my lov'd Laeta forever away,
				<br>And the river god pity'd, as weeping I pac'd
				<br>Mingling hot bitter tears with his cold frozen waste.
				<p>Now the flow'rs have return'd, but they bloom not so sweet
				<br>As in days when they blossom'd round Laeta's dear feet;
				<br>And the willows complain to the answering hill,
				<br>And the thrushes that once were so happy are still.
				<p>The green meadows and groves in their loneliness pine,
				<br>Whilst the dryads no more in their madrigals join,
				<br>The breeze once so joyous now murmurs and sighs,
				<br>And blows soft o'er the spot where my lov'd Laeta lies.
				<p>So pensive I roam o'er the desolate lawn
				<br>Where we wander'd and lov'd in the days that are gone,
				<br>And I yearn for the autumn, when Zalal's blue tide
				<br>Shall sing low by my grave and the lov'd Laeta's side.
