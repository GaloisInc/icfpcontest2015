To "check" is a solution is valid:

cat SOLUTIONFILE | hexEval check PROBLEM_ID SEED

This will print the solution score, and some info.


To "record" a video:

cat SOLUTIONFILE | hexEval video PROBLEM_ID SEED [START_FRAME] [NUM_FRAMES] > web/steps.js

The SOLUTIONFILE should contain only the commands (no JSON stuff)
PROBLEM_ID is a number between 0 and 24
SEED is whatever seed
START_FRAME is optional, and it allows recording from some point on.  Useful for large solutions.
NUM_FRAMES limits how many frames to record.

To see the video, open "watch.html", which imports "steps.js"
