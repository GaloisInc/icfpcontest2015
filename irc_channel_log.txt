2015-08-06 12:44:13	asivokon	Any ideas?
2015-08-06 12:44:59	asivokon	Or this chat is not a place to discuss problems?
2015-08-06 12:47:31	savask	asivokon: Usually people do discuss hints here :-P
2015-08-06 12:48:05	savask	And about your question, for me it looks like a turing machine program.
2015-08-06 12:49:53	trilader	Also someone tweeted "
2015-08-06 12:50:09	trilader	R1 R1 R1 P1 R1 T1" at them and they replied with "T0."
2015-08-06 12:50:35	trilader	And they favourited "From the clues so far, the contest will be about quantum Turing machines that become sentient and awaken Cthulhu."
2015-08-06 12:51:38	asivokon	Wow, thanks
2015-08-06 12:52:14	savask	trilader: I wonder if it was a kind of joke or that "T0." indeed has a meaning.
2015-08-06 12:52:52	trilader	savask: Maybe it's a stop instruction or something
2015-08-06 12:53:50	savask	Hmm, but there is no T0 in the "program" they posted before.
2015-08-06 12:55:10	trilader	No but they only have one T instruction in the above code. So maybe T means stop (terminate) and 1 or 0 is the argument
2015-08-06 12:56:55	pbl64k	having a working, fairly generic and extensible TM implementation before the contest starts seems prudent, anyhow
2015-08-06 12:56:58	savask	What's the reason to have an argument in stop? Return code?
2015-08-06 12:57:05	pbl64k	whatever comes out of quantum Cthulhu part of it
2015-08-06 13:14:45	MagBo	Also golf, people.
2015-08-06 13:16:22	MagBo	savask: yes, something like "write 1 and halt".
2015-08-06 13:17:18	savask	MagBo: Then comment "T0." is pretty mean. "Don't say anything and stop talking", lol
2015-08-06 13:18:51	trilader	MagBo: Like finding the shortest/fastest turing machine configuration that does x
2015-08-06 13:19:02	MagBo	Q — quantum operation ?!
2015-08-06 13:19:17	MagBo	trilader: yeah, we are preparing to manipulate TMs
2015-08-06 13:19:30	MagBo	Reading papers about flow analysis and that stuff :)
2015-08-06 13:21:35	trilader	Someone on reddit say that might be a series of 3 qbit quantum computer states
2015-08-06 13:21:40	trilader	https://www.reddit.com/r/icfpcontest/comments/3fsk16/new_hint_tweet_from_organizers/ctte8sl
2015-08-06 13:22:37	jcazevedo	trilader: isn't that problem of finding the shortest/fastest turing machine very similar to the 2013 problem?
2015-08-06 13:23:18	trilader	Yes. But this time it _could_ be offline (maybe?)
2015-08-06 13:23:29	pbl64k	am I missing something? n-qubit state is supposed to be a 2^n-dimensional vector
2015-08-06 13:24:17	asivokon	yes, and we do have 2^3 vector here
2015-08-06 13:24:33	pbl64k	hmm, with N0 N0 terminator?
2015-08-06 13:25:45	asivokon	Well, no. We have 8 tokens in the orginal string, which are presumably series of measurements. Freq table of those is the vector of len 8
2015-08-06 13:27:01	asivokon	So, you essentially compute probability of each token, and that's 3-qubit state
2015-08-06 13:28:08	pbl64k	okay, I'm lost, by tokens you mean letter prefixes? there seem to be just seven of those
2015-08-06 13:28:18	<--	savask (~savask@Powder/Developer/savask) has left #icfp-contest
2015-08-06 13:28:27	pbl64k	the sampling theory does make sense, but the observation seems incomplete then
2015-08-06 13:29:06	MagBo	pbl64k: those tokens are just a sequence from the alphabet though
2015-08-06 13:29:19	MagBo	NOPQRST
2015-08-06 13:29:36	MagBo	we have no U here, but we can assume there is 0 Us.
2015-08-06 13:30:12	pbl64k	well, I see no reason to presume we're talking about a *3*-qubit state them
2015-08-06 13:30:19	pbl64k	we don't know the alphabet
2015-08-06 13:30:26	MagBo	Mhm
2015-08-06 13:30:51	pbl64k	well... this is gonna suck
2015-08-06 13:30:57	pbl64k	I hate tensor algebra
2015-08-06 13:31:53	MagBo	Especially compared to 2014
2015-08-06 13:32:02	MagBo	Btw, you won it, right, pbl64k?
2015-08-06 13:32:15	pbl64k	yes
2015-08-06 13:32:31	pbl64k	*that* one hit precisely all my sweet spots
2015-08-06 13:32:42	pbl64k	PLT and AI
2015-08-06 13:32:43	MagBo	Hats off. That was the best ICFPC I've participated.
2015-08-06 13:33:05	pbl64k	old-timers say 2006 was the best one ever
2015-08-06 13:33:35	pbl64k	I tinkered with that VM several years later, and it was just wonderful... probably would have been even better during the actual contest
2015-08-06 13:34:03	MagBo	I'm a new-fag. Started participating in 2012. Wanted to participate since LtG.
2015-08-06 13:34:06	asivokon	pbl64k: tokens are 'N0', 'N1', 'O0', 'P1' and so on. We have exactly 2^3=8 of those
2015-08-06 13:34:19	pbl64k	I'm not exactly an old-timer myself, I started in 2009
2015-08-06 13:34:37	MagBo	Btw, I'm on team TBD (the one with fj).
2015-08-06 13:35:11	pbl64k	asivokon: doesn't that seem awfully asymmetric to you?
2015-08-06 13:35:45	pbl64k	MagBo: oh, you've heard the horror stories about my participation in '11 then :-)

2015-08-06 13:38:19	pbl64k	and if we're sampling states of a 3-qubit system, there should be 16 different tokens
2015-08-06 13:38:48	pbl64k	nub $ sort $ words s
2015-08-06 13:38:49	pbl64k	heh
2015-08-06 13:38:56	asivokon	why? 16 tokens are for 4-qubit, if I got it right
2015-08-06 13:39:01	pbl64k	could be the humble beginnings of my solution
2015-08-06 13:39:13	pbl64k	assuming we're not all awfully off the mark, which is probably the case anyway
2015-08-06 13:40:36	pbl64k	asivokon: hmm, right you are, we're observing the entire state, but again it's not clear how does that map to actual outcomes
2015-08-06 13:43:23	asivokon	pbl64k: I'm going to give up and start thinking that there are not other outcomes than setting quantum computing theme...
2015-08-06 13:43:33	MagBo	I remember being 99% sure that ICFPC 2014 will be about music theory.

2015-08-06 13:45:16	MagBo	Damn, we did so much to it.
2015-08-06 13:46:04	savask	Well, at least this contest has a lot of _real_ clues. Like a turing machine on a logo and a crypto message in their twitter.
2015-08-06 13:46:07	MagBo	I was trying to find a pattern in life-evaluation of it, counting squares, interpreting those as ASCII
2015-08-06 13:46:16	MagBo	Yeah
2015-08-06 13:46:45	MagBo	I'd ignore the tweet about Terminator.

2015-08-06 13:49:28	savask	Not really. Btw, the tweet said "This is worrisome", so maybe it meant that the problem can be easily solved by quantum computers.
2015-08-06 13:49:50	pbl64k	that's a very small class of problems
2015-08-06 13:50:00	pbl64k	I do not fancy doing integer factorization, to be frank
2015-08-06 13:54:13	savask	pbl64k: Why are everyone so existed with those then?
2015-08-06 13:54:29	savask	I thought quantum computers are at least not slower than usual ones.
2015-08-06 13:54:33	pbl64k	I'm wondering myself...
2015-08-06 13:54:37	pbl64k	crypto, mostly, I think
2015-08-06 13:54:42	pbl64k	or the death of it
2015-08-06 13:55:07	pbl64k	yes, but asymptotic speed-up has been demonstrated only for a small class of problems

2015-08-07 14:42:40	savask	b_jonas: "Start" is the pdf they posted on the main site.

2015-08-07 14:42:53	savask	They could say "you can use any language in this contest"
2015-08-07 14:43:21	savask	But no, they used this formal speech to indicate that it's AS2H2's official position.

2015-08-07 14:43:46	b_jonas	savask: also, the homepage clearly states "Any programming language(s) on any platform(s) may be used."

2015-08-07 16:18:42	MagBo	when organizers say "and averaged" they mean, "averaged across the seeds in the latest submission", not "averaged against resulting values of previous submissions"
2015-08-07 16:19:53	b_jonas	Do you think that one of the Power Phrases contains three adjacent rotations of alternating direction (or something simliar), thus requiring you to lock a unit at the top of the board any time you incant it?
2015-08-07 16:21:28	sqweek	why would that require you to lock it at the top of the board?
2015-08-07 16:22:59	b_jonas	sqweek: Oh, I think you probably need four or five opposite rotations to force that. Two opposite locations on the same unit would cause a repetition of its position, which is disallowed by the game, so the only way you can incant such rotations is if a unit is locked by one of the rotations.
2015-08-07 16:25:28	b_jonas	sqweek: If you lock two units without moving them down, then clearly the second one is locked at the top of the board.

2015-08-07 20:30:44	gitanes_kickass	Rule clarification please: does the pivot count in the "same position" rule, or is it just about the member cells?
2015-08-07 20:31:33	gitanes_kickass	i.e. if we have a horizontal 2-cell stick with a pivot currently on the left cell, we move it to the right once and then rotate 180 degrees
2015-08-07 20:31:44	galois_Joey	It's just members
2015-08-07 20:31:52	gitanes_kickass	thanks
2015-08-07 20:33:14	Sukasa	doesn't it say that the pivot counts, i.e. the members AND the pivot must be in the same position as they were prior?
2015-08-07 20:33:36	Sukasa	so in your case you'd be fine
2015-08-07 20:36:25	galois_Joey	Sukasa is right

2015-08-07 21:18:24	MagBo	galois_Joey: galois_kiniry: am I correct when I assume that currently scoring counts power phrases properly, it's just that when LR will be evaluated, additional round of evaluation of submissions will be held which won't take power phrases into account?

2015-08-07 21:49:13	b_jonas	ice_wing: the game can end in two ways without an error. Either the game board gets sort of full so the next unit can't be placed in its starting position, or as many units have been placed as the "sourceLength" setting says in the program

2015-08-07 21:51:12	Sukasa	can one of those even exist
2015-08-07 21:51:14	galois_dmz	ykentaro: the power column is the count of all the phrases of power that appear in the solutions submitted for a single problem (or over all problems, on the left-hand side of the leaderboard). If one of the submitted solutions is invalid, it does not contribute to that count.
2015-08-07 21:51:17	Sukasa	wouldn't that instantly trigger an error?
2015-08-07 21:51:47	b_jonas	Sukasa: no, but it would require one unit to be locked at the top of the game board near where units spawned, so it would make the game hard.
2015-08-07 21:52:39	galois_dmz	ykentaro: (that is, all the _distinct_ phrases of power, not a total of number of occurrences)
2015-08-07 21:52:45	b_jonas	I wonder if the code is "uuddlrlrBA" where "dlrlr" is the part with the ugly rotations
2015-08-07 21:53:51	Sukasa	b_jonas: wouldn't rotating a piece and immediately rotating it back the way it went result in a piece being in the same position (including pivot), thus triggering an error scenario?
2015-08-07 21:54:05	Sukasa	or am I misunderstanding your original question
2015-08-07 21:54:14	b_jonas	Sukasa: not if it's locked by the first rotation
2015-08-07 21:54:21	Sukasa	right
2015-08-07 21:54:21	Sukasa	right
2015-08-07 21:54:54	b_jonas	The first rotation would bring it to an invalid position, such as by rotation a cell to above the game board.
2015-08-07 21:55:37	Sukasa	so for lrlr, that would make for three pieces getting locked at the top
2015-08-07 21:55:39	b_jonas	oh great, Cult of the Bound Variable has already submitted, like tom7 has said
2015-08-07 21:55:55	b_jonas	Sukasa: yes, and for "dlrlr" it's four pieces I guess
2015-08-07 21:56:05	b_jonas	"d" is a rotation too
2015-08-07 21:56:36	Sukasa	huh
2015-08-07 21:56:46	ice_wing	galois_dmz: will the list units be altered in that process or do the seeds satisfy that the indices will be indeed a permutation of [0..sourcelength-1]?
2015-08-07 21:58:00	 *	galois_kiniry going to lunch.  AFK.
2015-08-07 21:58:40	b_jonas	ice_wing: the random-generated numbers are taken modulo the number of the number of different units given in the problem, and the modulus indexes to that list. the source length is typically bigger than the number of different units, it gives the total number of units generated after which the game ends even if the board isn't full.
2015-08-07 21:58:56	b_jonas	ice_wing: see http://icfpcontest.org/spec.html#the_source
2015-08-07 21:59:03	galois_dmz	ice_wing: I believe you are misinterpreting the term "the source". The list of units provided with the problem is static; "the source" is the sequence of random indices into the list.

2015-08-07 22:11:17	ykentaro	galois_dmz: why is it that, in Problem 2, some people get positive points < 300 even though they get positive "Power" value?  I understand that if you manage to utter a power phrase you are guaranteed to get at least 300 points
2015-08-07 22:11:56	ice_wing	ykentaro: maybe they fail for some seeds?
2015-08-07 22:12:34	galois_dmz	ykentaro: scores are the average across all seeds for the problem; if the problem has multiple seeds, and you score 306 points for a power phrase with one seed and 0 for the others, the score would be less than 300.

2015-08-07 22:37:01	galois_dmz	No, there is no specification of available hardware/resource limits. Your program may use the provided informational parameters to tune its operation, if you choose.
2015-08-07 22:37:36	galois_dmz	There is no fixed maximum board size.

2015-08-07 22:39:04	galois_dmwit	jjourdan: Right, the leaderboard only reports the average over all seeds. You could submit a solution for just one seed (and know that you get score 0 on the other seeds)...

2015-08-07 22:40:50	|3b|	sure, but i might need to switch runtimes if it goes too low
2015-08-07 22:42:08	ocramz	do not go full dynamic-programming crazy
2015-08-07 22:42:39	|3b|	also, define "allocate more than this amount", is that address space or actually resident?
2015-08-07 22:43:09	b_jonas	hmm… so you may have to provide multiple different methods depending on what memory size and runtime you allow to the program?
2015-08-07 22:43:21	b_jonas	that, or guess correctly
2015-08-07 22:44:02	galois_dmz	|3b|: we will confer with the relevant powers about the resource issue and provide a clarification
2015-08-07 22:44:45	b_jonas	And of course, if the available runtime is small, you may have to choose to run on only some of the inputs.
2015-08-07 22:44:46	 *	|3b| 's preferred runtime uses about 45MB resident just to start up, with 1gb+ address space by default

2015-08-07 22:49:13	jcazevedo	galois_dmz: I was answered on twitter that no board would be larger than the ones provided
2015-08-07 22:49:17	galois_dmz	|3b|: (we are, after all, not disclosing how many problems and seeds we will run your program on during final judgement)

2015-08-07 22:49:36	Sukasa	galois: so the time/memory constraints are less about squeezing the most out of every byte and cycle, but just not being idiotic about wasted memory?

2015-08-07 22:49:42	b_jonas	galois_dmz: thanks for the clarification
2015-08-07 22:50:25	galois_dmwit	Sukasa: right
2015-08-07 22:50:47	Sukasa	awesome, thanks for the clarification
2015-08-07 22:50:59	b_jonas	Hmm, the specs seem to say the program has to contain one entry for each problem and seed, though that entry could be a trivial zero-score one such as one with the empty command string.
2015-08-07 22:51:03	|3b|	ok, 50x50 isn't too bad
2015-08-07 22:52:02	b_jonas	|3b|: well, besides the board size, the sourceLength might also matter, but I hope the sourceLength won't be very large
2015-08-07 22:52:12	galois_dmz	jcazevedo: unfortunately, the operative who posted that tweet was not aware of more recent discoveries that have been unearthed. we apologize for any confusion and will issue a clarification.
2015-08-07 22:52:32	|3b|	sure, but sourceLength doesn't affect the max size of just storing a copy of the board for every move or something simple like that to detect repeated moves
2015-08-07 22:54:07	foo_oz	i got a question regarding the RNG's seed
2015-08-07 22:54:50	foo_oz	it says "The random number associated with a seed consists of bits 30..16 of that seed, where bit 0 is the least significant bit."
2015-08-07 22:54:52	jcazevedo	galois_dmz: ok, thanks :)
2015-08-07 22:56:04	foo_oz	so we convert the seed to a 32bit binary and take the 16th to 30th bits and then convert it to an integer?
2015-08-07 22:56:19	b_jonas	foo_oz: yes, or a 31 bit binary if you prefer
2015-08-07 22:56:20	nyazdani	galois_dmz: will different runs have different time/memory limits? or will all runs be subject to the same resource constraints?
2015-08-07 22:57:43	galois_dmz	nyazdani: we are leaving this unspecified.
2015-08-07 22:57:53	MdeFalco	it's a pain to debug errors in submissions
2015-08-07 22:58:05	nyazdani	galois_dmz: oo scary... thanks
2015-08-07 22:58:14	b_jonas	MdeFalco: what? it's _much_ easier than in most previous icfps, because the specs are much more simple
2015-08-07 22:58:21	b_jonas	that's why I like this task
2015-08-07 22:58:31	galois_dmz	MdeFalco: by "errors in submissions", what exactly do you mean?
2015-08-07 22:58:57	b_jonas	galois_dmz: how would he know? he's debugging what the problem is right now :-)
2015-08-07 22:58:58	foo_oz	b_jonas: can you provide the resulting number for 17?
2015-08-07 22:59:10	b_jonas	foo_oz: the specs already has the sequence
2015-08-07 22:59:24	b_jonas	foo_oz: the first number is 0 because the high bits of 17 are zero
2015-08-07 22:59:30	foo_oz	i get either 00100000000000 or  00100000000000 or just 00000000000000
2015-08-07 22:59:56	foo_oz	ok, thanks
2015-08-07 23:00:03	galois_dmz	MdeFalco: the intent of my question was "are you trying to figure out why a submission is not doing what you think it should, or trying to detect 'error' conditions in the gameplay that are triggered by the sequences of commands you are submitting?"
2015-08-07 23:00:48	galois_dmz	MdeFalco: (or, to put it another way: is this question about the problem itself, or about how the submission system is handling your answers?)
2015-08-07 23:01:20	b_jonas	(giving enough resources makes sense of course, for the cause of keeping the world safe is important enough)
2015-08-07 23:01:36	foo_oz	b_jonas: then the example sequence given is wrong: 0,24107,16552,12125,9427,13152,21440,3383,6873,16117 --- shouldnt it be a 12345 after the 0?

2015-08-07 23:02:21	b_jonas	foo_oz: you need the multiplier, multiply 17 by the multiplier, then add the increment
2015-08-07 23:02:36	b_jonas	foo_oz: then extract bits 30..16
2015-08-07 23:02:39	|3b|	foo_oz: the RNG keeps the full 32 bits internally, only the result is smaller
2015-08-07 23:03:09	MdeFalco	galois_dmz, don't worry I've got issues on my side. I can't seem to understand why as soon as my submission is a bit long, I get errors. I'm gonna reread the spec until the end ;-)
2015-08-07 23:03:24	galois_dmz	klhjfg: you may use any external libraries you like, if you bundle them and if their licenses allow you to use them for this purpose.
2015-08-07 23:03:28	b_jonas	|3b|: or 31 bits, whatever
2015-08-07 23:03:47	klhjfg	thank you
2015-08-07 23:03:50	foo_oz	b_jonas: (mul * 0 + increment) % mod is increment if it's smaller than mod
2015-08-07 23:04:10	b_jonas	MdeFalco: that's because if the submission has commands after the game has ended, that counts as an error and you get 0 score for that particular run
2015-08-07 23:04:22	|3b|	true, i guess you can ignore the modulus since you only ever use those bits in the results
2015-08-07 23:04:26	b_jonas	foo_oz: no, the starting seed is 17 in that example
2015-08-07 23:04:49	b_jonas	foo_oz: you modify and keep the seed, which is 31 bits long, but extract the 15 bits as the random number output
2015-08-07 23:04:55	b_jonas	foo_oz: the 31 bit seed is the internal state
2015-08-07 23:05:03	b_jonas	15 bits would be way too little for the seed
2015-08-07 23:05:09	b_jonas	or state
2015-08-07 23:05:40	Sukasa	I've been using a 32bit uint to store the current term

2015-08-07 23:05:59	MdeFalco	b_jonas, I'm quite sure it don't have any command after the end

2015-08-07 23:22:53	b_jonas	Some previous icfp contests had ICFP and the year number embedded somewhere. I wonder if "IFCP 2015" or something similar is a power word this year. That the digits 012345 are commands seems suspicious enough.
2015-08-07 23:23:33	b_jonas	though "FP" has the same problem as two opposite rotations
2015-08-07 23:24:03	b_jonas	only sort of worse, because a left or right move at the starting place on a large enough board can't lock an item from the starting position
2015-08-07 23:24:18	b_jonas	and the "20" part is also similar
2015-08-07 23:24:36	b_jonas	so embedding "FP 20" would be very difficut

2015-08-07 23:56:30	Sukasa	Galois: if multiple cores are chosen/rejected, will that be an exception to the "no knowledge of execution environment" policy, or will it remain unknown?
2015-08-07 23:57:49	b_jonas	Sukasa: the evaluation machine will almost certainly has at least two cores, because the organizers said “assume that you will have resources that you would expect to have on average hardware sold within the last 5 years”
2015-08-07 23:57:56	shurick	b_jonas: Thanks! I was looking at twitter instead.
2015-08-07 23:58:10	b_jonas	at least if they mean PC hardware, not mobile phone hardware or something
2015-08-07 23:58:38	b_jonas	but that doesn't tell whether it's only 2 cores, or like a high-end server of 24 cores with 3-way numa
2015-08-07 23:59:06	b_jonas	ok, most likely not 3-way numa, that's probably not "average hardware" yet

2015-08-08 00:13:45	Sukasa	I work in building automation.  We only recently got something with a processor faster than 25mhz, and I still occasionally find myself programming panels with 386s at their core
2015-08-08 00:16:40	b_jonas	Sukasa: I see. Where I work is a bit better in that respect, we work with somewhat more powerful hardware.
2015-08-08 00:17:29	Sukasa	mm
2015-08-08 00:17:57	Sukasa	the newer generation of hardware we're putting out has 240Mhz cores, but those are few and far between since we don't do many large jobs
2015-08-08 00:18:09	MdeFalco	stupid question, does clockwise direction takes into account the donward y axis?
2015-08-08 00:18:11	Sukasa	most of our stuff is tiny, boiler rooms or single air handlers.  You really don't need anything faster for thos

2015-08-08 00:21:16	b_jonas	Not the stuff we do at the job, but what people do at the ICFP contest.
2015-08-08 00:21:53	galois_kiniry	b_jonas: We do have esoteric stuff, but don't plan on applying it to this challenge.
2015-08-08 00:23:01	MdeFalco	jamie_ca : if I rotate around (0,0) clockwise do I get (0,1) -> (1,0) or (0,1) -> (-1,1)
2015-08-08 00:24:09	galois_kiniry	b_jonas: E.g., cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | tail -1

2015-08-08 00:24:33	jamie_ca	MdeFalco: pretty sure rotate is specifically one 60deg rotate, and you'll get 0,1 -> -1,1, rotate into a wall, and flunk due to illegal positioning
2015-08-08 00:24:39	galois_kiniry	And that's not our Big Box.
2015-08-08 00:24:53	b_jonas	galois_kiniry: how many NUMA domains?
2015-08-08 00:26:16	b_jonas	vmstat defaults to kilobytes by default apparently

2015-08-08 00:27:27	MdeFalco	jamie_ca: my question is about the clockwise direction
2015-08-08 00:27:33	galois_kiniry	b_jonas: I don't know offhand.
2015-08-08 00:27:56	galois_kiniry	Yuu-chan: The scoring error related to our not stopping input interpretation after an error state.

2015-08-08 00:28:54	jamie_ca	MdeFalco: yes, that's clockwise. Rotate (0,0), Unit (1,0), rotate clockwise moves unit to (0,1), rotate clockwise moves unit to (-1,1) and out of bounds

2015-08-08 01:56:16	|3b|	(closer to 3 hrs ago though)
2015-08-08 01:56:17	b_jonas	that's strange
2015-08-08 01:56:35	b_jonas	where does the spec even say that?
2015-08-08 01:56:48	jjourdan	"21:35 < galois_dmz> Yes, rotating pieces out of the top of the board is an error."
2015-08-08 01:56:58	jjourdan	so well..
2015-08-08 01:57:06	 *	|3b| couldn't find it by searching for "error" in the spec
2015-08-08 01:57:39	jjourdan	yes, indeed
2015-08-08 01:57:44	MdeFalco	we should get a trace
2015-08-08 01:57:52	MdeFalco	at least of the last frame before error
2015-08-08 01:57:59	jjourdan	this is the reason why I would like to have the list of everything that can cause an error
2015-08-08 01:58:24	|3b|	yeah
2015-08-08 01:58:30	galois_dmz	That is strange. I must have been possessed at the time - the specification is unambiguous on this point. Any command that would result in an invalid placement locks the unit in place - that would include any rotations (or moves) of unit members to locations off the board.

2015-08-08 02:00:55	jjourdan	so, just to be sure
2015-08-08 02:01:02	jjourdan	there are 3 kinds of errors :
2015-08-08 02:01:17	jjourdan	1- too long chain of commands
2015-08-08 02:01:23	jjourdan	2- invalid command
2015-08-08 02:01:33	jjourdan	3- repeating configuration
2015-08-08 02:01:56	spicey	4 - not using all the figures
2015-08-08 02:02:03	b_jonas	galois_dmz: thanks
2015-08-08 02:02:06	jjourdan	is that right ?
2015-08-08 02:02:13	jjourdan	spicey: what ?
2015-08-08 02:02:15	galois_dmz	jjourdan: You are correct. Those are the 3 types of error.
2015-08-08 02:02:40	b_jonas	(clearly the eldritch ones want to stop us from uttering certain power words of which I had speculated above.)

2015-08-08 02:03:03	spicey	I assume that if any figures are left over and cannot be placed anymore, then the game is lost, score = 0
2015-08-08 02:03:03	b_jonas	spicey: no, that's not an error
2015-08-08 02:03:11	yav	data GameError = InvalidCommand
2015-08-08 02:03:11	yav	               | CommandCausedError Command Step
2015-08-08 02:03:11	yav	               | CommandAfterEnd
2015-08-08 02:03:15	galois_dmz	Not using all the figures (that is, ending your sequence of commands when you could legitimately keep issuing commands) is not an error. But it is an odd thing to do.
2015-08-08 02:03:42	galois_dmz	Having leftover figures is also not an error.
2015-08-08 02:04:09	galois_dmwit	spicey: Why do you assume that? Are we saying that somewhere that we need to fix?
2015-08-08 02:04:21	--	MdeFalco is now known as MdeFalco_zZz
2015-08-08 02:06:09	b_jonas	galois_dmwit: no, but the spec is a bit vague, because it says “The game ends if one of the following conditions occurs” and doesn't list end of commands there
2015-08-08 02:06:23	mariageller	galois_dmwit: For me, it is somehow implied when you say that "A unit is in a valid location if all of its cells are on empty board cells". So outside of the board means invalid, and an invalid means locked?
2015-08-08 02:06:36	b_jonas	galois_dmwit: so it doesn't say what happens when you give too few commands
2015-08-08 02:07:12	jjourdan	one last question : is it possible that the pivot is outside the grid ?
2015-08-08 02:07:29	|3b|	jjourdan: spec says yes
2015-08-08 02:07:51	|3b|	"Note that a unit's pivot point need not be on a board cell. "
2015-08-08 02:08:06	galois_dmwit	mariageller: That is correct, and should be clear from the spec. spicey is talking about something else.
2015-08-08 02:09:00	spicey	galois_dmwit, can't find anything like that anymore, looks like you're not the only one possessed
2015-08-08 02:09:37	galois_dmwit	b_jonas: We are discussing how/where to clarify this. Thanks.
2015-08-08 02:09:51	mariageller	galois_dmwit: ah, right. sorry for that. so just to be sure, being outside of the board, as long as it is not the pivot, is not an error but an invalid movement?

2015-08-08 02:11:43	b_jonas	whew
2015-08-08 02:11:55	b_jonas	unless it already starts out in a negative row number
2015-08-08 02:12:07	ocramz	well the pivot moves along with the unit
2015-08-08 02:12:38	b_jonas	ocramz: sure
2015-08-08 02:13:56	ocramz	which makes me wonder: the Galois video of board 6 only shows pivots that are inside the units, and no cases when a row gets cleared
2015-08-08 02:14:21	ocramz	doesn't mean those cases can't occur though

2015-08-08 03:46:25	foo_oz	units from the source can be used multiple times, right?
2015-08-08 03:46:32	foo_oz	so
2015-08-08 03:46:48	foo_oz	should this be called "until sourceLength has been reached"?
2015-08-08 03:47:07	foo_oz	otherwise I dont understand the sourceLength parameter
2015-08-08 03:48:01	foo_oz	in problem_1 is just one unit
2015-08-08 03:48:15	foo_oz	and the sourceLength is 100
2015-08-08 03:48:21	foo_oz	so that unit can be used 100 times?
2015-08-08 03:48:30	galois_dmwit	The source may include particular units more than once
2015-08-08 03:48:40	foo_oz	yes
2015-08-08 03:49:06	foo_oz	so I confused units with the source?
2015-08-08 03:49:19	foo_oz	the source is generated from the units + the RNG + the sourceLength?

2015-08-08 06:06:36	Jean-Mich	we can't manage to get a non zero score...
2015-08-08 06:07:07	Jean-Mich	but the server gives no error and we can't find why our input is not accepted
2015-08-08 06:07:27	MagBo	Jean-Mich: look closely. Maybe type error?
2015-08-08 06:07:37	MagBo	Like Id and seed MUST be int, not string

2015-08-08 06:16:05	Jean-Mich	what's weird is that we have the exact same behviour as in the given video with the given command for problem 6
2015-08-08 06:16:52	illuminatedwax	question: if a unit U is locked, and the position a new unit would spawn is not a valid position, is it possible for any new cells to be marked "full", or will the board always look the same as when the unit U was locked? i.e. will the empty cells a newly spawned unit would otherwise fill be filled before the game ends, or will it be as though the new piece was never placed?

2015-08-08 06:17:39	MagBo	I submitted it to ref impl for lulz tho
2015-08-08 06:17:56	Jean-Mich	yeah no pb, thx again
2015-08-08 06:18:10	MagBo	mb you have some problems with collision detection?
2015-08-08 06:18:21	MagBo	something fundamental with rotation? idk
2015-08-08 06:18:24	MagBo	that's where we had bugs
2015-08-08 06:18:25	|3b|	Jean-Mich: from watching it play, i'm guessing we disagree about position of 4th piece at start (the "(" shaped one)
2015-08-08 06:18:54	 *	|3b| is iffy about centering though, so mine could still be wrong
2015-08-08 06:19:19	MagBo	Jean-Mich: ref impl says 0+0
2015-08-08 06:19:29	MagBo	(So sanity check passed)
2015-08-08 06:20:09	MagBo	Jean-Mich: pay close attention to what happens on turn 74
2015-08-08 06:20:17	MagBo	You can't spawn new unit there.
2015-08-08 06:20:34	MagBo	Your implementation must have a fundamental bug :( :( :( 
2015-08-08 06:20:37	MagBo	Oh!
2015-08-08 06:20:44	MagBo	Maybe you spawn units wrongly?
2015-08-08 06:21:24	MagBo	Anyway, I'll go write code. Pay attention to what happens after

2015-08-08 06:30:04	|3b|	yeah, that one looks wrong

2015-08-08 06:45:39	galois_dmz	trasla: yes, this is okay. in fact, doing so is critical to the survival of the human species.

2015-08-08 07:28:41	pgiarrusso	To be sure: is moving out of the board “invalid” (leading to a locked unit) or an error (leading to 0 score)?
2015-08-08 07:28:53	|3b|	invalid=locked
2015-08-08 07:30:07	foo_oz	does the curl yield "created" now as an answer?
2015-08-08 07:30:08	pgiarrusso	Thanks so error = repeated position | invalid command character and nothing else, right?
2015-08-08 07:30:22	pgiarrusso	foo_oz: also earlier
2015-08-08 07:30:26	|3b|	also too many commands
2015-08-08 07:30:56	|3b|	if game ends for any reason, any further commands cause an error
2015-08-08 07:31:36	pgiarrusso	|3b|: right, error = repeated position | invalid command character | move after game end

2015-08-08 07:49:39	foo_oz	so 30 is the 31st bit

2015-08-08 08:11:46	MagBo	Almost impossible to do anything cool with this sort of tooling.
2015-08-08 08:12:16	MagBo	Compare to last year when we were given ref. impl which was, how should I put it, doing half the job of the team.
2015-08-08 08:12:29	MagBo	LR could have been won w/o even implementing the game :)
2015-08-08 08:12:36	|3b|	heh
2015-08-08 08:12:59	MagBo	I have nothing against hardcore non-talkative ref.
2015-08-08 08:13:12	MagBo	Problem I see is that there is very aggressive stance on "abuse".
2015-08-08 08:13:36	MagBo	So every time I re-submit a solution over and over again, I feel like I'm walking on a thin ice.
2015-08-08 08:14:27	MagBo	And don't get me started on how weird will it feel to "smartly" brute-force power words, once we'll get to it.
2015-08-08 08:14:59	|3b|	yeah, that's probably main thing in favor of a reference implementation/tester... not having to worry about hitting the 'scoring' server for figuring things out
2015-08-08 08:15:17	galois_dmz	MagBo: don't worry about legitimate resubmissions; when we refer to "abuse", we are referring to explicit attempts to exploit/overwhelm/subvert/destroy the critical systems that help hold back the darkness.
2015-08-08 08:15:22	MagBo	Well, I mean, they should just instantiate exactlu the same server

2015-08-08 08:16:24	MagBo	OTOH I was very explicit in the team about not messing up with hitting the server from the heavy-testing code.
2015-08-08 08:17:05	MagBo	(We can submit as a library call, imagine 64 core machine running strategies in parallel and someone forgetting to remove submittion call)
2015-08-08 08:17:09	MagBo	(could be an honest mistake)
2015-08-08 08:17:16	MagBo	galois_dmz: also, what's up with queues?
2015-08-08 08:17:22	MagBo	I feel that they're not fair, which is sad.
2015-08-08 08:17:44	galois_dmwit	What queues are you referring to?
2015-08-08 08:17:48	|3b|	how do we create an account/team?
2015-08-08 08:17:48	MagBo	But it's entirely my speculation based on the fact that once chunk of 10 submissions of our team got evaluated almost instantly
2015-08-08 08:17:52	MagBo	after a considerate delay
2015-08-08 08:18:11	MagBo	like, it waited for 10 minutes, then spat out 10 results
2015-08-08 08:18:21	MagBo	which we've sent one after another.

2015-08-08 13:11:20	galois_dmz	Xaseon: they are happening every 10-20 minutes, but temporal distortions are causing the timestamps to lag by one full update; the current scoreboard, which has a timestamp almost 20 minutes ago, was actually posted 4 minutes ago.
2015-08-08 13:12:39	galois_dmz	we hope to calm the temporal eddies surrounding the scoreboard later today
2015-08-08 13:16:14	galois_dmz	and with that, I am going to attempt to sleep (though I expect my dreams will be haunted by hexagons)...
2015-08-08 13:19:35	MdeFalco	galois_dmz, I guess the timestamp is related to the start of the batch, so in a sense it's accurate

2015-08-08 19:48:23	galois_yav	This is the latest one available: Sat Aug  8 15:57:21 UTC 2015"
2015-08-08 19:49:19	galois_yav	generating the leaderboard takes about 15mins, and the time stamp is at the start of the process, which is why it looks older than it is.  as soon as i deploy the new version it should go faster

2015-08-08 19:55:35	InvisibleImp	I'm somewhat surprised the leaderboard is not generated dynamically from a database of the latest submissions for all players; it seems that with only 282 teams and 24 problems (with an average of less than 10 seeds), that could be pretty quick.  That's less than 60k rows...

2015-08-08 20:03:02	InvisibleImp	I suspect spanning multiple units is the only way to make some power phrases.  That's the only way to make "epitaph" work, for example, since that starts with MOVE E, MOVE W.

2015-08-08 20:29:47	galois_kiniry	Xaseron: Reflect upon what is made public on the leaderboard.  Namely, tags and Power.  You, too, can craft encodings.  More hints about power phrases will be forthcoming.  We are surprised at how few contestants have noticed in our hints.
2015-08-08 20:31:14	machinaut	At least some of us are still hacking around getting stuff to place in not-dumb fashions: http://imgur.com/1ws0oRG  -- though looks like those words can score pretty highly
2015-08-08 20:32:03	zulan_	galois_kiniry: of course you can read hints and *guess*, but if the only method of verification is to spam the server, with unknown response time and increasingly huge return dumps, it spoils the fun to put it nicely

2015-08-08 20:32:32	galois_kiniry	machinaut: The scoring is tuned so that no one can possibly win just by discovery of phrases of power.  That being said, between two very competitive AIs, the one that invokes more phrases will likely win.

2015-08-08 20:35:46	galois_kiniry	InvisibleImp: It is generated that way.  Recall that there are many seeds for some problems though, so we are simulating many thousands of boards at the moment.  The DB is not the fundamental problem.
2015-08-08 20:36:49	galois_kiniry	piggybank__sftw_: The main static contest pages are hosted at GitHub.  Any spurious HTTP responses and timeouts are beyond our control, but are unlikely.

Right  now I'm submitting the result of a single run of my program fo all tests (with a single combination of parameters). Sometimes I get signigicantly higher scores with different parameters in specific test cases.

2015-08-08 22:29:14	galois_kiniry	an immediate CCW will lock the first unit.  the score is 4.
2015-08-08 22:29:42	kostya	exactly, thats what I thought, however when I submit it the server scores it as 0
2015-08-08 22:30:06	bobry	Is the server operational? We've been waiting for the score for >10min already
2015-08-08 22:31:08	galois_yav	the server is operational, but is being swamped by hundreds of thousands of submissions!  maybe you guys should slow down a bit :-)

2015-08-08 23:32:42	grouzen	hello! my teammates and I just want to clarify information about the configuration of a unit. What does "local coordinate system" means in such case?
2015-08-08 23:34:30	grouzen	Does it means that 'members' are relative to the pivot coordinates or to the board's (0,0) point?
2015-08-08 23:35:23	trasla	members are relative to the board, as is the pivot
2015-08-08 23:35:45	grouzen	trasla: thanks a lot!
2015-08-08 23:36:03	jjourdan	but you still have to recenter it
2015-08-08 23:36:24	trasla	the "local" means that this unit is not actually on that position of the actual game board - the coordinates just place it in the edge to show how its members and pivot are placed relative to each other
2015-08-08 23:36:42	aliher	member coords are just member coords, you just recenter figures according to rules when you place them
2015-08-08 23:36:47	trasla	so when actually spwaning the unit, you need to calculate where to shift it to on the board
2015-08-08 23:38:35	Minoru	the question is, are the coordinates of members AND coordinates of pivots always positive?

2015-08-09 00:03:15	galois_yav	and teams that go to the finals but perform very poorly, are likely to make more space for other teams to go to the finals, so "creative" solutions don't really help anyone
2015-08-09 00:03:26	galois_yav	well, it was supposed to be accurate :)  bugs, bugs...

2015-08-09 00:03:42	pantsd	verifying that we understood the spec without being able to test it against a reference is hard :(
2015-08-09 00:03:52	andrei	galois_yav: There's no other feedback and as far as I can see there are no command sequences we can follow
2015-08-09 00:03:52	jjourdan	pbl64k: what are you using to see the score of a submission ?
2015-08-09 00:04:49	galois_yav	true, it is the eternal difficulty of programming... Hopefully we should be back very soon.
2015-08-09 00:05:05	mgregson	jjourdan: The leaderboard and a tag is what I've been using.

2015-08-09 00:06:05	pantsd	so just to be clear: the reference video is incorrect in ways we don't know, the reference scoring system is turned off but even once its turned back on its probably not going to be particularly accurate?
2015-08-09 00:06:39	pantsd	if like the contest organizers don't have a correct impl how are we supposed to make ours up super awesome?
2015-08-09 00:07:15	mgregson	jjourdan: but you can get them from that URL too yeah
2015-08-09 00:07:45	mgregson	pantsd: I suppose we implement to the spec and assume that we've made no programming errors.
2015-08-09 00:08:07	pantsd	that seems optimistic?
2015-08-09 00:08:57	cashto	galois folks: I accidentally created multiple teams.  If you like, you can remove teams 184 and 185.  I am only using team 183.  Might help clean up the leaderboard.  Thanks!
2015-08-09 00:09:05	galois_yav	pantsd: the scoring system is down because some teams were abusing the system, and it would be unfair to other teams if we kept scoring things
2015-08-09 00:09:20	galois_yav	cashto: no worries
2015-08-09 00:09:39	pantsd	wait how do people abuse the scoring system?
2015-08-09 00:10:07	cashto	DOS it?  :-)  Ofc I expect they have some per-team throttling.
2015-08-09 00:10:23	pbl64k	I suppose you could brute force for phrases of power, but that seems insane

2015-08-09 02:31:54	galois_dmz	"ei!" should count. is it not counting in the score, or simply not counting in the "power score" column?
2015-08-09 02:32:44	|3b|	it seems to count the points correctly, just not counting them
2015-08-09 02:32:50	tilarids	for me it's counted in the score but not in the power score
2015-08-09 02:33:04	|3b|	counting the # of words that is (or reporting them in the submit page)
2015-08-09 02:33:15	galois_dmz	OK. Then it's probably a reporting error, rather than a scoring error, and thus almost certainly straightforward to fix.

2015-08-09 04:15:02	MichaelSmith	How can problem 1 achieve a score higher than 900 without power words? There are 100 1-cell units and 27 filled cells, width 15, so you can clear at most 8 rows. You can only clear 1 row at a time (1-cell units), and only place 100 1-cell units. That seems to add up to a max score of 900.
2015-08-09 04:15:48	|3b|	are you counting bonus from clearing a row with previous unit?
2015-08-09 04:16:35	Sukasa	you need to clear at least 2 rows in one go to get that bonus on the next piece

2015-08-09 11:57:31	trasla	for problem 0 and 1, the leaderboard does report exactly twice the number of points my program calculated - for other problems, the numbers match. I would gladly find out it is a bug in our software, but the ranking for problem 1 for example looks like it is unlikely that our lead is justified - could someone check and tell me whether we are actually that good?

2015-08-09 13:37:20	esssing	could the leaderboard be *adding* the scores of submissions for a given problem instead of averaging them?
2015-08-09 13:38:26	galois_dmwit	That should not be the case. Do you have a reason to believe it is?
2015-08-09 13:38:36	galois_dmwit	If you're talking about the same thing as trasla, that was not the source of the problem.

2015-08-09 13:41:01	MdeFalco	it's easier to extract your score from the json
2015-08-09 13:41:18	galois_dmwit	smaller rankings.js?

2015-08-09 13:42:42	esssing	we have a series of submissions which scores "n" on a problem. when we submit the first half and the second half separately we get "k" and "l" points respectively such that "k + l = n".

2015-08-09 14:18:10	LaRubin	We need a rule clarification: if a lock happens in the middle of a phrase of power would it break the phrase or not? We thought that it should not, but submitted solutions lead us to think that it might be a case
2015-08-09 14:19:23	galois_dmwit	Words of power release their thaumaturgical energy even if they span multiple units.

2015-08-09 14:25:44	galois_dmwit	esssing: We average your score across all requested seeds, even if you haven't submitted a solution for all those seeds.
2015-08-09 14:28:52	trasla	so if i re-submit a solution for one seed only, it will not take the previous solutions for other seeds, i have to include old solutions in the re-submitting?
2015-08-09 14:30:55	galois_dmwit	That I am not as sure of. Let me see if I can figure out the answer to that.
2015-08-09 14:31:01	trasla	and concerning the announcement of fixed leaderboard - did we have two solutions for a single problem in one submission? if so, i need to check the code, i was not aware that was possible to produce by us... sorry.
2015-08-09 14:31:19	galois_dmwit	I believe so. I'm not 100% certain, though.

2015-08-09 14:33:44	galois_dmwit	Your score should include the latest submission for each problem/seed combo. So perhaps I don't understand esssing's question fully yet after all.
2015-08-09 14:34:08	trasla	sorry for having another question, but just to be sure: it is no problem if i submit solutions for multiple problems together, correct? Or should I split that up into one submission per problem?

2015-08-09 16:50:51	trasla	MdeFalco: well, while the program will know all the words during scoring, it can help to build a better program by knowing some in advance. and its good for testing, and for scoring higher in the qualifiers
2015-08-09 16:51:04	trasla	galois_kiniry: good morning!
2015-08-09 16:52:24	MdeFalco	trasla, I see your point, the fact that I'm using a pretty generic solution with respect to power phrases prevented me to understand. But I guess, with some specifics phrases you can tweak a lot your algorithm.
2015-08-09 16:53:30	trasla	MdeFalco: yes, but even without tweaking, if i have some phrases to test with i can see whether the code to use them actually works and to find bugs in it

2015-08-09 19:46:00	pcn_	what are reasons we can get 0? As far as I understand: repeated position, and command after game ends, anything else?

2015-08-09 19:48:37	trasla	pcn_: using "ia!-ia!" is invalid, cause "-" is no command character
2015-08-09 19:50:40	pcn_	any command that moves the unit to an invalid position locks that unit, which is more general than regular Tetris right? Say I can move a unit to the left and lock it there without going all the way to the bottom?

2015-08-09 20:35:16	b_jonas	zulan_: I don't think so. The only way to really verify a power phrase is if you use that power phrase alone to try to control the situation when someone is summoning the Old Ones, and see the effect. That would be very reckless. I don't think even the organizers can be completely sure that all of the power phrases the scoring server accepts are real power phrases.
2015-08-09 20:36:13	galois_yav	we are pretty sure we now only accept real power words :)  it'd be reckless not to do so!
2015-08-09 20:36:45	b_jonas	zulan_: someone explained once that flood control has a thousand rules, of which nine hundred don't help at all, but nobody knows which nine hundred, because the only way to be sure is to break them and see if the dams break and towns get flooded.
2015-08-09 20:37:35	zulan_	am I the only one who thinks this kind of guessing with the only verification being a ridiculously bloated and unpredictably delayed API is stupid?
2015-08-09 20:37:51	zulan_	sorry but it kind of spoiled the fun for us yesterday and if that didnt improve :/
2015-08-09 20:38:58	b_jonas	zulan_: it's probably deliberate. multiple icfp contests earlier didn't tell everything about what tasks the submitted programs shall expect, and they had to perform well against unexpected challenges.
2015-08-09 20:39:19	zulan_	don't get me wrong, I dont criticise guessing / clues / riddles (though not my personal favorite) but working against a broken API just sucks

2015-08-09 20:42:18	jamie_ca	zulan_: as far as scoring power words, score a word twice for 300 points, otherwise the power words are only 2 points per letter. If you're just filling time on an otherwise vertical drop, EI! five times is just as many points as a 15-long power word (kinda hand-wavy ignoring rotation)
2015-08-09 20:42:45	b_jonas	jamie_ca: twice?
2015-08-09 20:42:54	b_jonas	I thought it was enough to score it once
2015-08-09 20:42:59	b_jonas	you get 300 for each power word known
2015-08-09 20:43:13	jamie_ca	oh man, I'm confusing myself again
2015-08-09 20:43:17	b_jonas	that you can embed to the solution
2015-08-09 20:43:18	jamie_ca	line bonus is only if scoring 2+ lines
2015-08-09 20:43:26	jamie_ca	power word bonus is totally 1+
2015-08-09 20:43:47	galois_yav	a single line scores at least 100 points
2015-08-09 20:44:00	b_jonas	of course, if there are overlapping power words, then there might be a way to get lot of scores
2015-08-09 20:44:28	jamie_ca	and a 5-line (with one of the straight pieces I've seen) is 1500 points just for the clears, and 40% bonus on your next piece
2015-08-09 20:44:41	jamie_ca	which if it also clears...
2015-08-09 20:46:42	b_jonas	and if there are power words with no vertical moves, you might get a lot of points from them on an empty board
2015-08-09 20:47:05	jamie_ca	b_jonas: as long as you can avoid repeats, sure ;)
2015-08-09 20:47:35	jamie_ca	bunch of rotates, plus a net move East, repeat until wall, go SW and W to wall, repeat repeat...
2015-08-09 20:47:47	jamie_ca	it'd sure be good filler ;)
2015-08-09 20:48:59	trasla	my code sometimes scores more points when i do not tell it the power words....
2015-08-09 20:49:03	b_jonas	The ultimate craze would be if there was a phrase of power made of only tab, newline, and return characters, because then you could repeat that any number of times in the solution

2015-08-09 21:13:51	b_jonas	so you should check if the power is equal

2015-08-09 21:28:28	b_jonas	oal_: um, the easy part is that they have control over the units.

2015-08-10 07:15:25	Unagi_iwiwi	I strongly agree with that; best strategies highly depend on (rough orders of) time limits
2015-08-10 07:17:26	Unagi_iwiwi	I also am very eager to know rough memory limits, e.g., <4GB, 16GB or >64GB  (the difference would also definitely disable or enable some of our strategies)
2015-08-10 07:18:18	trasla	i kind of expect that the system for scoring will be able to do what my notebook does...
2015-08-10 07:18:56	trasla	it is a nice notebook, though. but still calculating  since over an hour...
2015-08-10 07:22:55	MagBo	Unagi_iwiwi: organizers said something along the lines

2015-08-10 07:23:44	MagBo	Oh
2015-08-10 07:23:48	galois_dmwit	We said you can expect the hardware was purchased in the last five years.

2015-08-10 07:26:00	galois_dmwit	That is on purpose.
2015-08-10 07:28:11	Unagi_iwiwi	so, you mean, we would not given any memory limit information, and we should prepare memory-efficient solvers, normal solvers, and memory-consuming solvers?
2015-08-10 07:28:37	Unagi_iwiwi	and only one of them will be used, depending on your equipment?
2015-08-10 07:28:57	Unagi_iwiwi	thare really requires great care
2015-08-10 07:30:14	Unagi_iwiwi	some (and actually most) algorithms are hard to be smoothly adjusted to given memory limits

2015-08-10 07:31:27	 *	galois_dmwit nods agreeably
2015-08-10 07:31:42	galois_dmwit	It's possible that you will need to make some difficult judgment calls about what to focus on with limited information.
2015-08-10 07:37:25	Unagi_iwiwi	hmm... even rough estimate would be highly helpful to avoid wasteful preparation in this limited contest time
2015-08-10 07:37:39	Unagi_iwiwi	please conside to disclose some info
2015-08-10 07:37:40	Unagi_iwiwi	thanks
2015-08-10 07:39:04	|3b|	well, they said there will be enough memory to not constrain language/implementation choice implying a minimum of a few tens of MB :)
2015-08-10 07:40:04	MagBo	|3b|: implying also that memory will scale adequately as a function of difficulty of map.

2015-08-10 08:40:25	Sjlver	Hello. Would there be a way to get hints on a bug in our code? We have some submissions that show zero points on the leaderboard, and we can't figure out why they would be invalid. Any hint would be apreciated.
2015-08-10 08:41:12	Sjlver	@kupopo AFAIK the limit is for the entire invocation of the program (i.e., all seeds)

2015-08-10 15:14:10	MagBo	we had to do it
2015-08-10 15:14:22	MagBo	and we also had to do internal tournaments
2015-08-10 15:14:31	trasla	is nobody willing to share the power phrase list? i would like to run the program with it while being out for lunch...

2015-08-10 15:14:43	nlew	I think my favorite solution we tried was "      dear galois if jeff goldblum is not a power word we will revolt"
2015-08-10 15:14:45	MagBo	and organize submissions bc reference server and score board is the same server

2015-08-10 15:14:53	@galois_dmz	I will give a list of power phrases once I have finished the final scoreboard.

2015-08-10 15:16:22	nlew	"monkeyboy" was a nice one

2015-08-10 15:16:32	MagBo	Ia! Ia!

2015-08-10 15:17:23	krakrjak	nlew: great technique!
2015-08-10 15:17:29	branan	Our algorithm around power phrases was "Try to use one when you can" which meant we'd use "Ei!" over... and over... and over
2015-08-10 15:17:38	Sjlver	cashto: Bay area.
2015-08-10 15:17:49	branan	turns out that left a slight leftward bias in all our movements, which caused us some problems in clearing lines effectively :/
2015-08-10 15:18:02	cashto	cool
2015-08-10 15:18:12	branan	we didn't realize that was happening until ike 2AM, which was way too late to try to fix it effectively

2015-08-10 15:18:29	krakrjak	we tried a SE bias with not wanting to lock as long as possible.  That was a really good starting point.
2015-08-10 15:18:34	tilarids	the fun part about monkeyboy was that we accidentally found an isomorphism of this phrase and spent hours trying to find something that fits

2015-08-10 15:43:02	MagBo	dmz is my favourite organizer
2015-08-10 15:43:24	krakrjak	oohh well.  I guess I shouldn't have submitted that last run.  We would have been in the top 100.  We'll get 'em next year.
2015-08-10 15:44:26	@galois_dmz	slash: I'm not sure what happened with your submissions; they all ended up zero-length. However, since you did send the MD5sum in the channel, we will accept that submission if you email it to us.

2015-08-10 15:45:17	krakrjak	that is way off though...  WTF?  I doulbe checked the logs locally and we should have many more scores...  Was there an issue with the final submissions?  It was right up against the deadline...  maybe got truncated?

2015-08-10 15:46:26	krakrjak	could be a screw up on my end, but I'm just surprised.
2015-08-10 15:46:28	MagBo	well, let's hope orgs have logs
2015-08-10 15:46:47	@galois_dmz	We did not shut down the submission server until 5 minutes after the deadline. However, it is possible that there is a problem with the final set of scores. Most likely we will regenerate the entire scoreboard from the database tomorrow by rescoring everything (the database contains all the submissions, from the beginning of the contest, except for those for invalid seeds).
2015-08-10 15:47:01	slash_	galois_dmz: thank you!
2015-08-10 15:47:14	MagBo	I'll head off to bed.

2015-08-10 15:47:37	MagBo	And thanks to organizers.
2015-08-10 15:47:44	MagBo	That was a good ICFPC.
2015-08-10 15:47:49	@galois_dmz	branan: you clearly do hold the distinction of finding the most phrases on your own.
2015-08-10 15:48:09	@galois_dmz	MagBo, krakrjak: you're welcome. it was our pleasure to do our part in the fight against the darkness.
2015-08-10 15:48:25	MagBo	actually they were very smart about the scavenge hunt part
2015-08-10 15:48:37	MagBo	rotating hunters and auxiliary workers
2015-08-10 15:48:44	MagBo	is the least we could have done better
2015-08-10 15:48:54	MagBo	because hunters get tunnel-vision

2015-08-10 15:50:03	aleister	is there a way to see if a submission (tgz) went through?
2015-08-10 15:50:42	@galois_dmz	(going through back logs of the channel from when I was messing with server now)
2015-08-10 15:51:25	@galois_dmz	MagBo: bitmasks were not designed for trading; I actually came up with them very near the last minute, when we were deciding exactly what information should be shown on the scoreboard, but we did not really plan for them to ever be visible to contestants.
2015-08-10 15:51:57	@galois_dmz	MagBo: however, the fact that they did end up visible (through the GET functionality) and enabled trading added a dimension that we had not anticipated. It was fun to watch.
2015-08-10 15:52:25	aleister	are you going to publish the phrase list?
2015-08-10 15:52:40	@galois_dmz	MagBo: As for quantum turing machines and golfing... a question for another time.
2015-08-10 15:52:50	@galois_dmz	aleister: yes, I can check if a submission went through.
2015-08-10 15:52:58	@galois_dmz	And yes, we will publish the phrase list.

2015-08-10 15:53:31	@galois_dmz	When was the submission made?
2015-08-10 15:53:45	aleister	some 30 minutes before the deadline

2015-08-10 15:54:04	@galois_dmz	The latest one we have for your team is 11:07 UTC. That's 53 minutes before, but the filename matches. Do you have an md5sum?
2015-08-10 15:54:17	aleister	that's the one, we only sent once
2015-08-10 15:54:19	aleister	thanks
2015-08-10 15:54:23	@galois_dmz	OK.

2015-08-10 15:54:29	@galois_dmz	Glad I could put your mind at ease.

2015-08-10 16:00:08	@galois_dmz	As we've said a few times, we intend to make all the contest artifacts public. And the static website isn't going to go away, since it's hosted on GitHub.

2015-08-10 16:01:45	@galois_dmz	And now, we're an hour past contest end. The Agency hates the paperwork associated with overtime, so I think I'm going to have to call it a night. But I'll probably pop in here now and then between now and ICFP, perhaps with tidbits and updates, and other organizers may too.
2015-08-10 16:01:54	krakrjak	we were never going to get most of those...  we were too heads down in the code and only got 5 and couldn't get the program to output them.
2015-08-10 16:02:43	@galois_dmz	One of the very interesting things I'm looking forward to is seeing what kinds of balances competitors struck between pure hex playing and power phrase generation. Evaluating the submissions is going to be a lot of fun.
