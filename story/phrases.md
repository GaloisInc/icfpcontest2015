Use a query like
 select content_path from solutions where content_path like '%Planet 10%';
to see if anyone has discovered a solution.

If results are too long, try constraining the length of solutions printed
  select content_path from solutions where content_path like '%YogSothoth%' and char_length(content_path) < 50;


Reveal Plans:

CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN -  
dmz: it was indeed my plan to hint this in the final hours of the contest, with another redaction and something like "we have calculated that the submitted davar have pushed back the date of REDACTED by at least *x* amount of time... keep pushing!" - but worded better

Very long phrase - 
dmz: we may want to give another hint about this one, or refer back to the Yiddish tweet somehow, since it was hinted before the contest and people may not realize it was a power phrase hint rather than a hint about the theme (or may not go back and look at pre-contest tweets.

Cthulhu fhtagn! - 
dmz: unless it's been guessed very commonly, we may want to call back to that as well in some oblique way, since it was a pre-contest hint.

Tsathoggua - 
if we feel like our fixes for that are good enough, that's fine... we may want to rescore old entries if that hasn't happened already. there was speculation on IRC that it was "something nobody had tried yet", which clearly is not right.
